What is the association between cell phone use and glioblastoma?,"[[['This investigation of a brain cancer cluster in Missouri used two approaches to  investigate associations with potential risk factors. In a case-control study in  a rural town, we interviewed surrogates of cases and controls about potential  risk factors. We found a statistically significant positive association of brain  cancer with reported exposure to dental X-rays. Occupation was not associated  with the cluster in the rural town. In a standardized proportional mortality  study for the state of Missouri, we calculated the observed and expected  proportion of brain cancers by occupation and industry in Missouri decedents. We  found that motor vehicle manufacturers, beauty shop workers, managers and  administrators, elementary school teachers, and hairdressers and cosmetologists  had significantly elevated proportions of brain cancer. Brain tumors are  inconsistently associated with occupation in the literature. Further study of  brain cancer etiology with respect to dental X-ray exposures seems warranted.', 'A practical mathematical model for glioblastomas (brain tumours), which  incorporates the two key parameters of tumour growth, namely the cancer cell  diffusion and the cell proliferation rate, has been shown to be clinically  useful and predictive. Previous studies explain why multifocal recurrence is  inevitable and show how various treatment scenarios have been incorporated in  the model. In most tumours, it is not known when the cancer started. Based on  patient in vivo parameters, obtained from two brain scans, it is shown how to  estimate the time, after initial detection, when the tumour started. This is an  input of potential importance in any future controlled clinical study of any  connection between cell phone radiation and brain tumour incidence. It is also  used to estimate more accurately survival times from detection. Finally, based  on patient parameters, the solution of the model equation of the tumour growth  helps to explain why certain patients live longer than others after similar  treatment protocols specifically surgical resection (removal) and irradiation.', 'BACKGROUND: Use of cell phones has increased dramatically since 1992 when they  were first introduced in France. Certain electromagnetic fields (at extremely  low frequency) have been recognized as possibly carcinogenic by the  International Agency for Research on Cancer. Given the use of radiofrequency  technology in cell phones, the rapid increase in the number of cell phones has  generated concerns about the existence of a potential health hazard. To evaluate  the relationship between the use of cell phones and the development of tumors of  the head, a multicentric international study (INTERPHONE), coordinated by the  International Agency for Research on Cancer, was carried out in 13 countries.  This publication reports the results of the French part of the INTERPHONE study. METHODS: INTERPHONE is a case-control study focused on tumors of the brain and  central nervous system: gliomas, meningiomas and neuromas of cranial nerves.  Eligible cases were men and women, residents of Paris or Lyon, aged 30-59, newly  diagnosed with a first primary tumor between February 2001 and August 2003. The  diagnoses were all either histologically confirmed or based upon unequivocal  radiological images. Controls were matched for gender, age (+/-5 years) and  place of residence. They were randomly drawn from electoral rolls. Detailed  information was collected for all subjects during a computer-assisted  face-to-face interview. Conditional logistic regression was used to estimate the  odds ratio (OR) for an association between the use of cell phones and risk of  each type of cancer. RESULTS: Regular cell phone use was not associated with an increased risk of  neuroma (OR=0,92; 95% confidence interval=[0.53-1.59]), meningioma (OR=0,74; 95%  confidence interval=[0.43-1.28]) or glioma (OR=1.15; 95% confidence  interval=[0.65-2.05]). Although these results are not statistically significant,  a general tendency was observed for an increased risk of glioma among the  heaviest users: long-term users, heavy users, users with the largest numbers of  telephones. CONCLUSION: No significant increased risk for glioma, meningioma or neuroma was  observed among cell phone users participating in Interphone. The statistical  power of the study is limited, however. Our results, suggesting the possibility  of an increased risk among the heaviest users, therefore need to be verified in  the international INTERPHONE analyses.', ""A case-control study of brain tumor was conducted in collaborating hospitals in  Boston, Providence, and Baltimore. Cases were 160 consecutive patients being  treated for glioblastoma, grade 3 or 4 astrocytoma, or anaplastic astrocytoma.  Controls were 128 healthy persons identified among the case's friends. A complex  self-administered questionnaire was used to assess exposure to factors of  interest. There was some evidence that glioblastoma is associated with a  decreased susceptibility to allergies, a finding that may call attention to the  involvement of immunologic disturbances in brain tumors. Our data are not  supportive of previous reports of an association between brain tumors and  exposure to pets or farm environment, family history of CNS malignancies or  other neurologic conditions, or irradiation to the head. We did not find any  evidence for an association with life-style characteristics such as cigarette  smoking, alcohol consumption, use of drugs of any kind, or dietary intake of  cured or smoked meat or fish."", 'We included in a case-control study on brain tumours and mobile and cordless  telephones 1,617 patients aged 20-80 years of both sexes diagnosed during  January 1, 1997 to June 30, 2000. They were alive at the study time and had  histopathology verified brain tumour. One matched control to each case was  selected from the Swedish Population Register. The study area was the  Uppsala-Orebro, Stockholm, Linköping and Göteborg medical regions of Sweden.  Exposure was assessed by a questionnaire that was answered by 1,429 (88%) cases  and 1,470 (91%) controls. In total use of analogue cellular telephones gave an  increased risk with odds ratio (OR)=1.3, 95% confidence interval (CI)=1.04-1.6,  whereas digital and cordless phones did not overall increase the risk  significantly. Ipsilateral use of analogue phones gave OR=1.7, 95% CI=1.2-2.3,  digital phones OR=1.3, 95% CI=1.02-1.8 and cordless phones OR=1.2, 95%  CI=0.9-1.6. The risk for ipsilateral use was significantly increased for  astrocytoma for all studied phone types, analogue phones OR=1.8,95% CI=1.1-3.2,  digital phones OR=1.8, 95% CI=1.1-2.8, cordless phones OR=1.8, 95% CI=1.1-2.9.  Use of a telephone on the opposite side of the brain was not associated with a  significantly increased risk for brain tumours. Regarding anatomical area of the  tumour and exposure to microwaves, the risk was increased for tumours located in  the temporal area on the same side of the brain that was used during phone  calls, significantly so for analogue cellular telephones OR=2.3, 95% CI=1.2-4.1.  For acoustic neurinoma OR=4.4, 95% CI=2.1-9.2 was calculated among analogue  cellular telephone users. When duration of use was analysed as a continuous  variable in the total material, the risk increased per year for analogue phones  with OR=1.04, 95% CI=1.01-1.08. For astrocytoma and ipsilateral use the trend  was for analogue phones OR=1.10, 95% CI=1.02-1.19, digital phones OR=1.11, 95%  CI=1.01-1.22, and cordless phones OR=1.09, 95% CI=1.01-1.19. There was a  tendency of a shorter tumour induction period for ipsilateral exposure to  microwaves than for contralateral, which may indicate a tumour promotor effect.', ""Glioblastoma multiforme (GBM) is the most lethal subtype of glioma, classified  as a WHO grade 4 infiltrative glioma.

During the incubation phase, cells were exposed at  the specific absorption rates (SARs) of 80, 250, or 800 mW/kg with both CW and  W-CDMA RF fields for up to 96 h. Heat shock treatment was used as the positive  control. No significant differences in cell growth or viability were observed  between any test group exposed to W-CDMA or CW radiation and the sham-exposed  negative controls. Using the Affymetrix Human Genome Array, only a very small (<  1%) number of available genes (ca. 16,000 to 19,000) exhibited altered  expression in each experiment. The results confirm that low-level exposure to  2.1425 GHz CW and W-CDMA RF fields for up to 96 h did not act as an acute  cytotoxicant in either cell proliferation or the gene expression profile. These  results suggest that RF exposure up to the limit of whole-body average SAR  levels as specified in the ICNIRP guidelines is unlikely to elicit a general  stress response in the tested cell lines under these conditions.', ""Glioblastoma multiforme (GBM) is the most lethal subtype of glioma, classified  as a WHO grade 4 infiltrative glioma.

Separate analyses were conducted for the 202 glioma pairs and the 70  meningioma pairs. Meningioma, but not glioma, was related to having a serious  head injury 20 or more years before diagnosis [odds ratio (OR) = 2.3; 95%  confidence interval (CI) = 1.1-5.4], and a clear dose-response effect was  observed relating meningioma risk to number of serious head injuries (P for  trend = 0.01; OR for greater than or equal to 3 injuries = 6.2; CI = 1.2-31.7).  Frequency of full-mouth dental X-ray examinations after age 25 related to both  glioma (P for trend = 0.04) and meningioma risk (P for trend = 0.06). Glioma,  but not meningioma risk, related to duration of prior employment in jobs likely  to involve high exposure to electric and magnetic fields (P for trend = 0.05).  This risk was greatest for astrocytoma (OR for employment in such jobs for  greater than 5 years = 4.3; CI = 1.2-15.6). More glioma cases had worked in the  rubber industry (discordant pairs 6/1) and more worked in hot processes using  plastics (9/1). More meningioma cases had jobs that involved exposure to metal  dusts and fumes (discordant pairs 13/5), and six of these cases and two controls  worked as machinists. Finally, there was a protective effect among glioma pairs  relating to frequency of use of vitamin C and other vitamin supplements (P for  trend = 0.004); the OR for use at least twice a day was 0.4 (CI = 0.2-0.8).']]]","The study found no significant increased risk for glioblastoma among cell phone users in the INTERPHONE study.

Which disease of the central nervous system is characterized by the presence of Lewy bodies?,"[[[""The identification of the alpha-synuclein gene on chromosome 4q as a locus for  familial Lewy-body parkinsonism and of alpha-synuclein as a component of Lewy  bodies has heralded a new era in the study of Parkinson's disease. We have  identified a large family with Lewy body parkinsonism linked to a novel locus on  chromosome 4p15 that does not have a mutation in the alpha-synuclein gene. Here  we report the clinical and neuropathological findings in an individual from this  family and describe unusual high molecular weight alpha-synuclein-immunoreactive  proteins in brain homogenates from brain regions with the most marked  neuropathology. Distinctive histopathology was revealed with alpha-synuclein  immunostaining, including pleomorphic Lewy bodies, synuclein-positive glial  inclusions and widespread, severe neuritic dystrophy. We also discuss the  relationship of this familial disorder to a Lewy body disease clinical spectrum,  ranging from Parkinson's disease to dementia with psychosis."", 'Dementia with Lewy bodies (DLB) is characterized by the widespread presence of  Lewy bodies (LBs) in the brain. alpha-Synuclein, the main component of LBs, is  expressed as two main isoforms (112 and 140), but little is known about their  differential expression in the brain. We compared alpha-synuclein 112 and  alpha-synuclein 140 expression levels in the prefrontal cortices of six DLB  patients, eight Alzheimer disease (AD) patients, and six control subjects.  Relative alpha-synuclein 112 and alpha-synuclein 140 expression levels were  determined by real-time polymerase chain reaction with competimer technology  using a LightCycler System. Whereas total alpha-synuclein levels were just  marginally elevated in DLB in comparison with the other groups, alpha-synuclein  112 was seen to be markedly increased in DLB compared with AD cases and  controls. In contrast, alpha-synuclein 140 levels were significantly diminished  in both neurodegenerative disorders in comparison with controls. These results  show differential overexpression of alpha-synuclein 112 in DLB, a finding that  could be of importance in DLB pathogenesis.', 'Progressive supranuclear palsy (PSP) is a neurodegenerative tauopathy  characterized by Parkinsonism, vertical gaze palsy, and early falls. Lewy bodies  (LBs) are detected in approximately 10% of PSP cases, but there is little  information on the relationship of LBs to tau pathology. We determined the  frequency of LBs in a large series of autopsy-confirmed cases of PSP and studied  the density and distribution of LBs, including Parkinson disease stage, in cases  with LBs (PSP/LBD). PSP/LBD was compared with pure LB disease (LBD), including  assessment of neuronal loss in key brainstem nuclei. Immunohistochemistry for  alpha-synuclein revealed LBs in 31 of 290 PSP cases (11%). One case had multiple  system atrophy in addition to PSP and was excluded from further study along with  2 PSP/LBD cases with concurrent Alzheimer disease. The 29 cases of PSP/LBD were  compared with 30 cases of PSP and 24 cases of LBD. The age, sex, brain weight,  Braak neurofibrillary tangle (NFT) stage, as well as counts of NFTs and senile  plaques were not different among PSP, LBD, and PSP/LBD, but disease duration was  longer in LBD. The Parkinson disease stage was similar, but the density of LBs  in most subcortical nuclei tended to be greater in LBD than in PSP/LBD. In  contrast, substantia nigra neuronal loss was greater in PSP/LBD than both PSP  and LBD. Double immunostaining demonstrated alpha-synuclein and tau in different  neurons with few exceptions. The findings suggest that LBs in PSP are similar in  distribution to those in LBD and independent of tau pathology. The greater  density of LBs in LBD compared with PSP/LBD may be the result of longer disease  duration in LBD, whereas greater neuronal loss in the substantia nigra in  PSP/LBD may be the result of vulnerability of this brain region to both disease  processes.', ""It is increasingly clear that the normal protein alpha-synuclein is in some  manner closely associated with presynaptic components of select neuronal types  within the adult human central nervous system (CNS) and, in addition, that in  its pathologically altered state alpha-synuclein aggregates selectively in the  form of filamentous inclusion bodies during certain progressive  neurodegenerative disorders, such as familial and sporadic Parkinson's disease.  By having the antibody AFshp raised specifically to alpha-synuclein to label  Parkinson disease-specific Lewy bodies and Lewy neurites as well as synaptic  boutons containing the unaltered protein, an initial attempt is made to map the  overall distribution pattern and describe the staining behavior of the  immunoreactive punctae in select regions of the prosencephalon. Neocortical  immunolabeling is most prominent in the prodigious, but incompletely myelinated,  association fields and faintest in the heavily myelinated primary motor and  primary sensory fields, with the premotor and first order sensory association  areas occupying an intermediate position. Of the thalamic grays evaluated, those  containing powerfully myelinated fiber tracts (e.g. centrum medianum, habenular  complex) show the weakest immunolabeling, whereas, less sturdily myelinated  structures are highly immunoreactive. The fact that the immunostaining spectrum  for normal alpha-synuclein is so broad, together with the fact that some  thalamic sites actually are immunonegative leads to the following conclusions  (1) alpha-synuclein, although present in the synaptic boutons of many nerve  cells in the adult human CNS, is by no means ubiquitous there, and (2) neuronal  types lacking the normal protein cannot generate the Parkinson's  disease-specific filamentous pathology."", 'alpha-Synuclein is a presynaptic protein recently identified as a specific  component of Lewy bodies (LB) and Lewy neurites. The aim of this study was to  assess the morphology and distribution of alpha-synuclein immunoreactivity in  cases of dementia with LB (DLB), and to compare alpha-synuclein with ubiquitin  immunostaining. We examined substantia nigra, paralimbic regions (entorhinal  cortex, cingulate gyrus, insula and hippocampus), and neocortex (frontal and  occipital association cortices) with double alpha-synuclein and ubiquitin  immunostaining in 25 cases meeting neuropathological criteria for DLB.  alpha-Synuclein immunostaining was more specific than ubiquitin immunostaining  in that it differentiated LB from globose tangles. It was also slightly more  sensitive, staining 4-5% more intracytoplasmic structures, especially diffuse  alpha-synuclein deposits that were ubiquitin negative. In addition to LB,  alpha-synuclein staining showed filiform and globose neurites in the substantia  nigra, CA2-3 regions of the hippocampus, and entorhinal cortex. A spectrum of  alpha-synuclein staining was seen in substantia nigra: from diffuse ""cloud-like""  inclusions to aggregated intracytoplasmic inclusions with variable ubiquitin  staining to classic LB. We hypothesize that these represent different stages in  LB formation.', ""Autonomic failure with Lewy bodies (AF-LB) was first described by Fichefet et  al. in 1965, and more than ten cases have been reported to date. AF-LB and  Parkinson's disease (PD) share the neuropathological findings characterized by  widely distributed Lewy bodies in the central nervous system including the  substantia nigra and locus coeruleus. However, clinical manifestations of AF-LB  are far different from PD in which autonomic dysfunction, if present, is not a  predominant feature. In the present study, clinical features were comparatively  analysed in AF-LB and PD to investigate the nosological relation between PD and  AF-LB. The subjects were 94 patients with PD and 11 reported cases of AF-LB in  the literature. A test of 70 degrees passive head-up tilt was performed upon the  patients with PD in our laboratory. Based on the results in tilting test, the  patients with PD were divided into two groups; PD-I (69 cases) with an  orthostatic fall of systolic blood pressure less than 30 mmHg, and PD-II (25  cases) with a fall of 30 mmHg or more. Autonomic dysfunctions were more extent  in PD-II than in PD-I, because the incidences of anhidrosis, impotence,  neurogenic bladder and constipation were higher in PD-II. All of the cases of  AF-LB were contained in the previous literatures with reasonably full clinical  descriptions. Mean age at onset of the disease was 62.1 +/- 8.7 (mean +/- SD)  years old in PD-I, 64.5 +/- 7.5 years old in PD-II and 63.9 +/- 9.0 years old in  AF-LB, and no significant differences were found among the three  groups.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)"", ""Parkinson's disease (PD) is the second most common neurodegenerative disorder  that is characterized by two major neuropathological hallmarks: the degeneration  of dopaminergic neurons in the substantia nigra (SN) and the presence of Lewy  bodies in the surviving SN neurons, as well as other regions of the central and  peripheral nervous system. Animal models have been invaluable tools for  investigating the underlying mechanisms of the pathogenesis of PD and testing  new potential symptomatic, neuroprotective and neurorestorative therapies.  However, the usefulness of these models is dependent on how precisely they  replicate the features of clinical PD with some studies now employing combined  gene-environment models to replicate more of the affected pathways. The rotenone  model of PD has become of great interest following the seminal paper by the  Greenamyre group in 2000 (Betarbet et al., 2000). This paper reported for the  first time that systemic rotenone was able to reproduce the two pathological  hallmarks of PD as well as certain parkinsonian motor deficits. Since 2000, many  research groups have actively used the rotenone model worldwide. This paper will  review rotenone models, focusing upon their ability to reproduce the two  pathological hallmarks of PD, motor deficits, extranigral pathology and  non-motor symptoms. We will also summarize the recent advances in  neuroprotective therapies, focusing on those that investigated non-motor  symptoms and review rotenone models used in combination with PD genetic models  to investigate gene-environment interactions."", ""Parkinson's disease, also known as paralysis agitans, is a progressive  degenerative disorder of the central nervous system, with onset usually between  the ages of 50 and 65 years, and is associated with loss of dopaminergic neurons  in the subsantia nigra and the presence of Lewy bodies. It is characterized by  the triad of resting tremor, muscular rigidity and bradykinesia.  Often-accompanying abnormalities include disorders of equilibrium, posture and  autonomic function, including micturition. Symptoms from the lower urinary tract  add a significant comorbidity factor in these patients. The incidence and  prevalence of lower urinary tract dysfunction rise with increasing progression  of the underlying neurological disease. They present a troublesome and difficult  to treat health issue with a profound impact on the patient's quality of life.  Storage symptoms seem to predominate. In the long term, renal function might be  compromised, mainly as a result of elevated intravesical pressure. Various  conservative, minimally-invasive and surgical treatment options are available to  prevent harmful sequelae, and to improve the quality of life of these patients.  We present an overview of current and prospective treatment strategies."", ""BACKGROUND: Lewy body disease is a heterogeneous group of neurodegenerative  disorders characterized by alpha-synuclein accumulation that includes dementia  with Lewy bodies (DLB) and Parkinson's Disease (PD). Recent evidence suggests  that impairment of lysosomal pathways (i.e. autophagy) involved in  alpha-synuclein clearance might play an important role. For this reason, we  sought to examine the expression levels of members of the autophagy pathway in  brains of patients with DLB and Alzheimer's Disease (AD) and in alpha-synuclein  transgenic mice. METHODOLOGY/PRINCIPAL FINDINGS: By immunoblot analysis, compared to controls and  AD, in DLB cases levels of mTor were elevated and Atg7 were reduced. Levels of  other components of the autophagy pathway such as Atg5, Atg10, Atg12 and  Beclin-1 were not different in DLB compared to controls. In DLB brains, mTor was  more abundant in neurons displaying alpha-synuclein accumulation. These neurons  also showed abnormal expression of lysosomal markers such as LC3, and  ultrastructural analysis revealed the presence of abundant and abnormal  autophagosomes. Similar alterations were observed in the brains of  alpha-synuclein transgenic mice. Intra-cerebral infusion of rapamycin, an  inhibitor of mTor, or injection of a lentiviral vector expressing Atg7 resulted  in reduced accumulation of alpha-synuclein in transgenic mice and amelioration  of associated neurodegenerative alterations. CONCLUSIONS/SIGNIFICANCE: This study supports the notion that defects in the  autophagy pathway and more specifically in mTor and Atg7 are associated with  neurodegeneration in DLB cases and alpha-synuclein transgenic models and  supports the possibility that modulators of the autophagy pathway might have  potential therapeutic effects."", ""Parkinson's disease is characterized by α-synuclein pathology in the form of  Lewy bodies and Lewy neurites. Braak et\u2009al described the spatial and temporal  spread of α-synuclein pathology in Parkinson's disease.

In  this review, we highlight the involvement of α-synuclein in Parkinson's disease  and in Braak's staging of Parkinson's disease pathology. We discuss whether a  prion-like mechanism of α-synuclein spread might contribute to Parkinson's  disease pathology. We describe recent studies investigating cell-to-cell  transfer of α-synuclein and focus our review on the long-distance axonal  transport of α-synuclein along neurons.""]]]","Lewy body diseases, including dementia with Lewy bodies (DLB) and Parkinson's disease (PD), are characterized by the presence of Lewy bodies in the central nervous system.","[{'Exact': array([ 3.21390325,  2.47644696,  2.57373252,  0.49192282,  0.87846261,

The NoSAS Score can be used for screening of which disorders?,"[[['A hearing screening program was performed to determine the prevalence of hearing  loss and abnormal tympanometry in individuals with short-stature skeletal  dysplasias attending a national meeting. Behavioral audiometry, otoacoustic  emission testing, and tympanometry were used to assess hearing. Failed hearing  screen was defined as hearing ≥ 35 dB at one or more frequencies or by ""fail"" on  otoacoustic emissions. One hundred ten of 112 subjects completed the screening.  58 (51.8%) were children. Seventy-three (65.2%) had achondroplasia, 34 (30.4%)  had one of 11 other diagnoses, and 5(4.4%) were undiagnosed. 25.8% of children  failed hearing screening in one or both ears, while 46.3% of adults failed in  one or both ears. 55.1% of adults and 25.0% of children with achondroplasia  failed screening. Abnormal hearing was also found in the some patients with  spondyloepiphyseal dysplasia congenital (SEDC; 75%), diastrophic dysplasia  (66%), and Morquio (66%). Hearing was normal in those with hypochondroplasia,  pseudoachondroplasia, and microcephalic osteodysplastic primordial dwarfism.  Tympanometry was abnormal in at least one ear in 53.3% of children and 38.5% of  adults. Abnormal tympanometry in the absence of functioning tympanostomy tubes  was associated with 9.5 greater odds of hearing loss in children and 2.8 greater  odds of hearing loss in the total cohort. Only 3 (2.7%) respondents reported the  use of hearing aids. Hearing loss and middle ear disease are common in both  children and adults with skeletal dysplasia. Adults were more likely to fail  hearing screening than children. Abnormal tympanometry is associated with  hearing loss. Hearing screening with appropriate intervention is recommended for  these patients.', ""INTRODUCTION: Substance use and abuse and their consequences are a major problem  among adolescents. The screening for problematic alcohol and substance use,  abuse and dependence should be part of the case-taking process for adolescents.  The Problem Oriented Screening Instrument for Teenagers (POSIT) and the Car,  Relax, Alone, Forget, Family/Friends, Trouble questionnaire (CRAFFT) are used to  this end. POSIT: 17 items corresponding to substance use and abuse (POSITsua); it has been  validated in Spanish. CRAFFT: six questions; it has not been validated in Argentina. OBJECTIVE: To assess the validity of a version of the CRAFFT screening test  adapted to Spanish in a group of Argentine adolescents using the POSITsua test  as reference. POPULATION AND METHODS: The CRAFFTa and the POSITsua tests were administered to  14-20 year-old adolescents. An affirmative answer was scored as 1, and a  negative answer, as 0. An individual was considered to have an increased risk of  problematic use, abuse and dependence if he/she scored >2 in the CRAFFTa and  POSITsua tests. RESULTS: Two hundred and eighty-six adolescents were included; 52% were female;  mean age: 16.6 years old. The CRAFFTa score was >2 for 29%, while the POSIT  score was >2 for 37%. CRAFFTa sensitivity: 59%; specificity: 88%. CRAFFTa  positive predictive value: 0.74; negative predictive value: 0.78. The area under  the curve was 0.73. In the linear regression, the R for the six CRAFFT questions  was 0.60. Gender and age did not modify results. Cronbach's alpha was 0.64. CONCLUSION: CRAFFTa sensitivity was 59%, and its specificity was 88%, compared  to the POSITsua test as a screening tool for problematic alcohol and substance  use, abuse and dependence among Argentine adolescents."", 'Objective: To evaluate the effect of arterial blood HCO3- level on the accuracy  of NoSAS questionnaire screening for obstructive sleep apnea hypopnea syndrome  (OSAHS). Methods: The hospitalized patients with suspected OSAHS were recruited  from March 2016 to December 2017 in the First Affiliated Hospital of Guangzhou  Medical University. NoSAS scores, blood gas analysis and polysomnography (PSG)  were performed in these patients. Patients were divided into non OSAHS group and  mild, moderate and severe OSAHS group according to the PSG results. According to  the NoSAS questionnaire score, the patients were divided into OSAHS high-risk  group and low risk group. The correlation between arterial blood HCO3- level and  apnea hypopnea index (AHI) was analyzed. The receiver operating characteristic  (ROC) curve was plotted to analyze the accuracy of HCO3- prediction OSAHS.  Predictive parameters(sensitivity, specificity, positive and negative predictive  values)for NoSAS scores and HCO3- level were calculated. Results: A total of 243  patients with suspected OSAHS were included, including 186 males (76.5%), 57  females (23.5%), age (49±13) years, body mass index (BMI) (26.9±4.4) kg/m2, and  neck circumference (38.6±4.5) cm. The HCO3- level was positively correlated with  AHI (r=0.206, P=0.001). The proportion of patients with HCO3- level ≥26 mmol/L  in non-OSAHS group was lower than that in OSAHS group (13.0% vs 34.5%, P=0.004);  the proportion of patients with HCO3- level ≥26 mmol/L in severe OSAHS group was  higher than that in mild OSAHS group (37.7% vs 15.0%, P=0.008), and there was no  difference in the ratio of patients with severe OSAHS and moderate OSAHS (37.7%  vs 35.3%, P=0.767). The specificity of OSAHS predicted by HCO3- level 25 and 26  mmol/L was 69.6% and 87.0%, respectively. With the NoSAS score of 8 or 7 as  cutoffs for analysis, the sensitivity for OSAHS was 61.9% and 79.2%, the  specificity for OSAHS was 57.4% and 40.4%, respectively. With the addition of  HCO3- level ≥ 26 mmol/L to the NoSAS score ≥ 7, the specificity for OSAHS  improved to 93.6%, while the sensitivity decreased to 27.4%. Conclusion:  Combined with the arterial blood HCO3- level, the specificity of the NoSAS  questionnaire increases and the sensitivity decreases.', 'OBJECTIVES: The NoSAS score has been shown to be a reliable screening tool for  obstructive sleep apnea (OSA) in overall populations. This study aimed to  explore the effects of age and sex on the predicting performance of this score. METHODS: A retrospective analysis was conducted on 1119 subjects aged ≥ 18 years  and with a total sleep time of ≥ 4 h during overnight polysomnography.  Discrimination was assessed by using areas under receiver operating  characteristic curve (AUCs), while predictive parameters were calculated by  using contingency tables. RESULTS: Overall, a NoSAS score of 8 points or higher resulted in sensitivity,  specificity, and AUC for predicting an apnea-hypopnea index (AHI) of ≥ 20  events/h of 74%, 36%, and 0.63 (in non-elderly 73%, 46%, and 0.65; in elderly  91%, 17%, and 0.59; in men 85%, 18%, and 0.56; in women 52%, 76%, and 0.71,  respectively). The AUCs at all AHI cutoffs were significantly lower in men than  in women (all with p < 0.01), while the AUCs at AHI cutoff of 5, 15, and 30  events/h were significantly lower in elderly than in non-elderly (p < 0.01,  0.05, and 0.05, respectively). In non-elderly, a conventional NoSAS with cutoff  of 7 or a modified NoSAS with age cutoff of 50 years provided sensitivity and  specificity for predicting an AHI of ≥ 20 events/h of 87%, 37% and 80%, 36%,  respectively, with comparable AUCs. In women, a conventional NoSAS with cutoff  of 6 or a modified NoSAS with neck circumference cutoff of 35 cm provided  sensitivity and specificity for predicting an AHI of ≥ 20 events/h of 85%, 39%  and 79%, 52%, respectively, with comparable AUCs. CONCLUSIONS: NoSAS score has better discrimination but lower sensitivity for  predicting OSA in non-elderly and women than in their counterparts. Age- and  sex-specific cutoff values reverse this imbalance. Our results underline the  preference of age- and sex-specific cutoff values and the need for better age-  and sex-specific screening algorithms.', 'OBJECTIVE: To assess the efficacy of the prenatal screening and diagnostic  programme for the detection of the common autosomal trisomies in the North West  Thames region prior to the introduction of serum screening. DESIGN: A retrospective study based on reports made to the North West Thames  Regional Health Authority Congenital Malformation Register. SUBJECTS: 235 pregnancies of women delivered in units in the North West Thames  region over a two-year period (1990-91) whose babies or fetuses were diagnosed  as having Down, Edwards or Patau syndrome. RESULTS: 33% of Down syndrome, 68% of Edwards syndrome and 52% of Patau syndrome  were diagnosed prenatally (before 28 weeks) in the region without the use of  serum screening. CONCLUSIONS: Using maternal age and routine ultrasound as screening methods,  units in the region are prenatally diagnosing significantly fewer Down syndrome  babies than are those in authorities using serum screening. The use of maternal  age and ultrasound screening is more effective for the antenatal detection of  the other autosomal trisomies than it is for the detection of Down syndrome. It  is not yet clear to what extent serum screening might be expected to increase  the detection rate for these conditions.', 'Sotos syndrome (SoS) is a multiple anomaly, congenital disorder characterized by  overgrowth, macrocephaly, distinctive facial features and variable degree of  intellectual disability. Haploinsufficiency of the NSD1 gene at 5q35.3, arising  from 5q35 microdeletions, point mutations, and partial gene deletions, accounts  for a majority of patients with SoS. Recently, mutations and possible  pathogenetic rare CNVs, both affecting a few candidate genes for overgrowth,  have been reported in patients with Sotos-like overgrowth features. To estimate  the frequency of NSD1 defects in the Brazilian SoS population and possibly  reveal other genes implicated in the etiopathogenesis of this syndrome, we  collected a cohort of 21 Brazilian patients, who fulfilled the diagnostic  criteria for SoS, and analyzed the NSD1 and PTEN genes by means of multiplex  ligation-dependent probe amplification and mutational screening analyses. We  identified a classical NSD1 microdeletion, a novel missense mutation (p.C1593W),  and 2 previously reported truncating mutations: p.R1984X and p.V1760Gfs*2. In  addition, we identified a novel de novo PTEN gene mutation (p.D312Rfs*2) in a  patient with a less severe presentation of SoS phenotype, which did not include  pre- and postnatal overgrowth. For the first time, our study implies PTEN in the  pathogenesis of SoS and further emphasizes the existence of ethno-geographical  differences in NSD1 molecular alterations between patients with SoS from  Europe/North America (70-93%) and those from South America (10-19%).', 'The use of metabolomic and lipidomic strategies for selecting potential  biomarkers for obstructive sleep apnoea (OSA) has been little explored. We  examined adult male patients with OSA (defined by an apnoea-hypopnoea index ≥15  events/hour), as well as age-, gender-, and fat-composition-matched volunteers  without OSA. All subjects were subjected to clinical evaluation, sleep  questionnaires for detecting the risk of OSA (Berlin and NoSAS score),  metabolomic analysis by gas chromatography coupled to mass spectrometry and  lipidomic analysis with liquid chromatography followed by detection by MALDI-MS.  This study included 37 patients with OSA and 16 controls. From the 6 metabolites  and 22 lipids initially selected, those with the best association with OSA were  glutamic acid, deoxy sugar and arachidonic acid (metabolites), and  glycerophosphoethanolamines, sphingomyelin and lyso-phosphocholines (lipids).  For the questionnaires, the NoSAS score performed best with screening for OSA  (area under the curve [AUC]\u2009=\u20090.724, p\u2009=\u20090.003). The combination of the NoSAS  score with metabolites or lipids resulted in an AUC for detecting OSA of 0.911  and 0.951, respectively. In conclusion, metabolomic and lipidomic strategies  suggested potential early biomarkers in OSA that could also be helpful in  screening for this sleep disorder beyond traditional questionnaires.', ""OBJECTIVES: Pregnancies with Edwards or Patau syndrome are often detected  through screening for Down's syndrome. We aimed to evaluate the impact of  screening for Down's syndrome on the prevalence of live births and antenatal  diagnoses of Edwards and Patau syndrome. SETTING: England and Wales, 2005 to 2012. METHODS: Data from the National Down Syndrome Cytogenetic Register, which  contains information on nearly all ante- or postnatally diagnosed cases of  Edwards or Patau syndrome in which a karyotype was confirmed, were analysed. RESULTS: From 2005 to 2012, 3,941 diagnoses of Edwards syndrome and 1,567  diagnoses of Patau syndrome were recorded (prevalence of 7.0 and 2.8 per 10,000  births respectively). Only 11% (95% confidence interval [CI]: 10-12) of  diagnoses of Edwards syndrome and 13% (95% CI: 11-14) of Patau syndrome were  live births, resulting in live birth prevalences of 0.8 (95% CI: 0.7-0.8) and  0.4 (95% CI: 0.3-0.4) per 10,000 live births respectively. About 90% of  pregnancies with Edwards or Patau syndrome were diagnosed antenatally, and this  proportion remained constant over time. The proportion of diagnoses detected  before 15 weeks increased from 50% in 2005 to 53% in 2012 for Edwards syndrome,  and from 41% in 2005 to 63% in 2012 for Patau syndrome. CONCLUSIONS: Almost 700 women per year had a pregnancy with Edwards or Patau  syndrome. Over 90% of these pregnancies were detected antenatally, with the  increased use of first trimester screening for Down's syndrome resulting in the  reduction in the mean gestational age at diagnosis of these syndromes."", 'Objective: To evaluate the clinical utility of the NoSAS score in the screening  of patients with obstructive sleep apnea-hypopnea syndrome(OSAHS), and to  compare the performance of the NoSAS score with other tools including Epworth  Sleepiness Scale(ESS), STOP, STOP-Bang(SBQ) and Berlin questionnaires. Methods:  A total of 444 consecutive patients(328 males and 116 females) with suspected  OSAHS who underwent an overnight polysomnography(PSG) were recruited into this  study. Five questionnaires including the NoSAS score, ESS, STOP, SBQ and Berlin  were completed. Based on the severity of OSAHS which was determined by  apnea-hypopnea index(AHI), the patients were classified into 4 groups: normal(<5  events/h), mild(5-15 events/h), moderate(15-30 events/h) and, severe (≥30  events/h) OSA.Sensitivity, specificity, positive predictive values, negative  predictive values and the area under the receiver operating characteristics  curve of 5 questionnaires were calculated. Results: With AHI≥5 events/h as the  standard diagnosis of OSAHS, the NoSAS score and SBQ questionnaire showed a  moderate performance, with the NoSAS score having the largest area under the ROC  curve(0.753, P<0.001), followed by the SBQ questionnaire (0.727, P<0.001). The  performance of the ESS, Berlin, and the STOP questionnaire was not high. Using  mild moderate-severe(≥5 events/h), moderate-severe(≥15 events/h), and severe(≥30  events/h)OSAHS as cutoffs, NoSAS had the highest specificity and positive  predictive values(80.2% and 88%, 72% and 69.8%, 66.3% and 50.5%), and the  sensitivity and negative predictive values were (51.5% and 36.9%, 56.5% and  59.1%, 66.3% and 74.2%) .SBQ had the highest sensitivity and the negative  predictive values(80.2% and 88%, 72% and 69.8%, 66.3% and 50.5%), and the  specific and positive predictive values were (45.7% and 81.0%, 39.1% and 61.9%,  34.8% and 44.4%). The NoSAS score ≥ 7 had higher sensitivity and negative  predictive value(75.0% and 47.1%, 78.1% and 66.5%, 82.7% and 81.9%)than the  NoSAS socre ≥ 8. With AHI≥5 events/h as the standard diagnosis of OSAHS, the  NoSAS score and the SBQ questionnaire had a higher accuracy than the other 3  questionnaires as screening questionnaires for diagnosing OSAHS, and the value  of DOR were 4.298 and 3.758 respectively. Conclusions: The NoSAS score and the  SBQ questionnaire have a moderate performance in diagnosing OSAHS. The NoSAS  score is a new screening tool, and it is similar to the SBQ questionnaire, being  also simple and effective. While the SBQ questionnaire is more widely used, it  is necessary to further evaluate the diagnostic value of NoSAS score.', 'INTRODUCTION: Screening methods have become increasingly important due to the  growing number of patients suspected of having obstructive sleep apnea (OSA)  being referred to sleep clinics. The Lausanne NoSAS (Neck circumference,  Obesity, Snoring, Age, Sex) score test is a simple, efficient, and easily  employed tool enabling identification of individuals at risk for the disease.  The score ranges from 0 to 17 and the patient has a high probability of OSA if  they have a NoSAS score of 8 or higher. OBJECTIVES: To evaluate the performance of the NoSAS score as a screening tool  for the diagnosis of OSA in a sleep clinic. METHODS: Prospectively, for 12 months, we included all the patients referred by  primary care physicians to our sleep unit for clinical evaluation who had  undergone in-lab polysomnography (PSG) and completed the NoSAS score. This test  assigns 4 points for a neck circumference of more than 40cm, 3 points for a  body-mass index of 25kg/m2 to less than 30kg/m2 or 5 points for having a  body-mass index of 30kg/m2 or more, 2 points for snoring, 4 points for being  older than 55 years of age and 2 points for being male. RESULTS: Of the 294 patients, 70.7% were male, aged 53.5±12.1 years, with a neck  circumference of 41.0±3.6cm and a BMI of 30.8±5.1kg/m2. OSA was present in 84.0%  of the patients, 34.8% with moderate OSA and 36.4% severe OSA. Using the NoSAS  model for the prediction of all OSA, moderate/severe OSA and severe OSA, the  area under the ROC (Receiver Operating Characteristic) was 0.770 (IC95%: (0.703;  0.837), p<0.001), 0.746 (IC95%: (0.691; 0.802), p<0.001) and 0.686 (IC95%:  (0.622; 0.749), p<0.001), respectively, thus confirming the diagnostic ability  of the NoSAS model. With a NoSAS score ≥7, the sensitivity and positive  predictive value (PPV) were 94.3% and 87.6% for all OSA, 94.9% and 62.8% for  moderate/severe OSA and 100% and 33.8% for severe OSA, respectively. With the  same cut-off, the negative predictive value (NPV) for moderate/severe and severe  OSA were 67.9% and 100%, respectively. Each increase in the NoSAS score was  associated with an increase in the probability of OSA, reaching a 97% OSA  probability for a score of 17. CONCLUSIONS: The NoSAS score showed high sensitivity and PPV for OSA with  specificity and diagnostic accuracy steadily increasing with higher scores.  Furthermore, a low score showed high predictive value for the exclusion of  moderate/severe OSA. Overall, our results suggest that, in primary care, this  score can be a powerful tool for stratifying and prioritizing patients in the  diagnosis of OSA. Nevertheless, more studies are needed to evaluate the efficacy  of this score in hospital health care, in younger populations, with a  predominance of female and non-obese individuals or in cardiovascular disease.']]]",The NoSAS Score can be used for screening of Obstructive Sleep Apnea-Hypopnea Syndrome (OSAHS).,"[{'Exact': array([-0.99194158, -1.39767548, 14.47943484, -1.57993199, -1.29343094,

What species is associated with Tetrodotoxin?,"[[['Green toadfish Lagocephalus lunaris inhabits tropical and subtropical seas and  contains high tetrodotoxin (TTX) levels in the muscle as well as liver and  gonad. In 2008 to 2009, food poisoning due to ingesting L. lunais occurred in  Western Japan. Five specimens of green toadfish caught in Kyushu coast, Japan,  were analyzed for toxicity, toxins, and species identification. All five  specimens were toxic by bioassay. Comparing the maximum toxicity in tissues,  ovary contained the most toxin (1810 mouse unit [MU]/g), followed by liver  (341\u2009MU/g), muscle (135\u2009MU/g), skin (79\u2009MU/g), and intestine (72\u2009MU/g). Liquid  chromatography/mass spectrometry analysis revealed that TTX was the major toxin.  Nucleotide sequence analysis of the 16S rRNA gene fragment of muscle  mitochondrial DNA indicated that partial sequences of PCR products of four  specimens were identical with that of L. lunaris. The sequence of one specimen  was indistinguishable from that of the brown-backed toadfish Lagocephalus  wheeleri, a nontoxic species.', 'The inhibitory effects of toxin extracted from muscle or liver of five different  puffer fishes (hereafter referred as puffer(s)) captured on the Japanese sea  coast were examined on voltage-dependent sodium current (I(Na)) recorded from  dissociated single rat hippocampal CA1 neurons. The inhibitory effects estimated  from IC(50) values of toxin extracts on I(Na) were in the order of Takifugu  vermicularis > Lagocephalus wheeleri > Canthigaster rivulata > Takifugu rubripes  > Arothron reticularis from muscle and T. vermicularis > T. rubripes > L.  wheeleri > A. reticularis > C. rivulata from liver, thereby indicating that the  amount of toxin in the liver or muscle differs between puffers. In addition, the  present results indicate that the muscle of T. vermicularis, which is eaten in  Japan, contains relatively higher amounts of toxin compared to those of T.  rubripes, also eaten. This observation suggests that caution should be taken  concerning the maximal edible amount of muscle prepared from T. rubripes.', 'A survey of reptile-associated ticks and their infection status with severe  fever with thrombocytopenia syndrome (SFTS) virus was conducted to determine the  relative abundance and distribution among lizards, skinks, and snakes in the  Republic of Korea (ROK). In total, 132 reptiles, including 49 lizards (two  species), 15 skinks (one species), and 68 snakes (eight species) were collected.  In total, 84 ixodid ticks belonging to two genera (Ixodes and Amblyomma) were  collected from 28/132 (21.2%) lizards, skinks, and snakes. Ixodes nipponensis  Kitaoka & Saito was only collected from lizards and skinks, while Amblyomma  testudinarium Koch was only collected from snakes. Takydromus wolteri had the  highest tick index (0.7; total number ticks/total number collected hosts) among  lizards and skinks, while Rhabdophis tigrinus had the highest tick index (2.2)  among the snakes. Ixodes nipponensis larvae and nymphs accounted for 11.1% and  88.9%, respectively, of all ticks collected from lizards and skinks, while only  A. testudinarium nymphs were collected from snakes. Nymphs of both species of  ticks were collected from lizards and skinks from April to October, while I.  nipponensis larvae were collected only from September to October. Ixodes  nipponensis larvae and nymphs were preferentially attached to the lateral trunk  (83.3%) and the foreleg axillae (16.7%) of lizards and skinks. SFTS virus was  detected in both I. nipponensis and A. testudinarium collected from lizards and  snakes. Phylogenetic analysis of SFTS viruses of ticks collected from two  lizards and one snake demonstrated close relationships with SFTS virus strains  observed from humans and ticks in the ROK, China, and Japan. These results  implicate lizards and snakes as potential hosts of SFTS virus.', 'The inhibitory effects of toxin extracted from muscle or liver of five different  puffer fishes (hereafter referred as puffer(s)) captured on the Japanese sea  coast were examined on voltage-dependent sodium current (I(Na)) recorded from  dissociated single rat hippocampal CA1 neurons.

Although both types of toxin are polypeptides, there is more than a fourfold  difference in size between the two and no clear sequence homology is evident. A  systematic computer search of the three-dimensional structure of erabutoxin b  (an alpha-neurotoxin from the false sea snake Laticauda semifasciata) was  performed to identify the locality that most closely matched the amino acid  compositions of the smaller alpha-conotoxins (from the marine snails Conus magus  and Conus geographus). The area of greatest similarity centered on residue  position 25 of erabutoxin b, a locale that is conserved throughout the snake  alpha-neurotoxins and their homologues. Six proteins unrelated to erabutoxin b  were compared to the alpha-conotoxins to show that the extent of the erabutoxin  b/alpha-conotoxin match was too high to be coincidental. Homologues of  erabutoxin b, namely alpha-cobratoxin from Naja naja siamensis and cytotoxin  VII4 from Naja mossambica mossambica, were also analyzed. The extent of the  matching with the alpha-conotoxins decreased in the series erabutoxin b greater  than alpha-cobratoxin greater than cytotoxin VII4, and this also relates the  order of similarity to the pharmacological properties of the alpha-conotoxins.  The alpha-conotoxin-like area of the snake alpha-neurotoxins is peripheral to  the site previously considered important for binding to the cholinoceptor, even  though it seems to represent the focus of evolutionary convergence between the  two types of neurotoxin. The area of resemblance does, however, have strong  associations with the conformational behavior of the snake toxins. Hence, the  outcome of this study has important consequences for the current ideas on snake  alpha-neurotoxin structure/activity relationships and the evolutionary origins  of neurotoxicity.', 'Puffer fish, Takifugu niphobles, collected from the Hong Kong coastal waters  were screened for tetrodotoxin-producing bacteria. A Gram-negative,  non-acid-fast, non-sporing and rod shaped bacterial strain (designated as  gutB01) was isolated from the intestine of the puffer fish and was shown to  produce tetrodotoxin (TTX). Based on the Microbial Identification (MIDI) and  16S-23S rDNA internal transcribed spacer (ITS) phylogenetic analysis, the strain  was identified as Raoultella terrigena. The TTX production ability of the strain  was confirmed by mouse bioassay, ELISA and mass spectrometry (MALDI-TOF). Our  results reiterate that the TTX found in puffer fish was likely produced by the  associated bacteria and TTX are widely produced amongst a diversity of bacterial  species.', 'We report acute tetraplegia caused by rat bite fever in a 59-year old man (snake  keeper) and transmission of Streptobacillus moniliformis. We found an identical  characteristic bacterial pattern in rat and human samples, which validated  genotyping-based evidence for infection with the same strain, and identified  diagnostic difficulties concerning infection with this microorganism.', 'The selling and importing of puffer fish species and their products was banned  in Thailand in 2002, because of possible neurotoxic effects. However, the sale  of their flesh is still happening in Thai markets. Standard methods for toxin  quantification (HPLC and LC-MS) have significant limitations, therefore a  lateral flow, immuno-chromatographic test (TTX-IC) was developed as a tool for  rapid detection of toxin. A total of 750 puffer fishes (387 Lagocephalus  lunaris(LL), and 363 Lagocephalus spadiceus (LS)) and 100 edible fishes were  caught in Thailand from June 2011-February 2012. Screening of TTX from their  flesh by TTX-IC revealed that 69 samples (17.8%) of LL possessed TTX at  dangerous levels but LS and edible fishes did not. A selected 339 samples were  quantified by LC-MS/MS, showing 50 LL possessed TTX at dangerous levels.  Comparison of results with LC-MS/MS showed the TTX-IC to have 94.0% sensitivity  and 92.4% specificity. The TTX-IC will be a useful tool for TTX screening of a  large number of samples, reducing the testing required by LC-MS/MS, thus  reducing costs. All positive cases found should be confirmed by standard  methods.', 'Clostridium botulinum is a species of spore-forming anaerobic bacteria defined  by the expression of any one or two of seven serologically distinct botulinum  neurotoxins (BoNTs) designated BoNT/A-G. This Gram-positive bacterium was first  identified in 1897 and since then the paralyzing and lethal effects of its toxin  have resulted in the recognition of different forms of the intoxication known as  food-borne, infant, or wound botulism. Early microbiological and biochemical  characterization of C. botulinum isolates revealed that the bacteria within the  species had different characteristics and expressed different toxin types. To  organize the variable bacterial traits within the species, Group I-IV  designations were created. Interestingly, it was observed that isolates within  different Groups could express the same toxin type and conversely a single Group  could express different toxin types. This discordant phylogeny between the toxin  and the host bacteria indicated that horizontal gene transfer of the toxin was  responsible for the variation observed within the species. The recent  availability of multiple C. botulinum genomic sequences has offered the ability  to bioinformatically analyze the locations of the bont genes, the composition of  their toxin gene clusters, and the genes flanking these regions to understand  their variation. Comparison of the genomic sequences representing multiple  serotypes indicates that the bont genes are not in random locations. Instead the  analyses revealed specific regions where the toxin genes occur within the  genomes representing serotype A, B, C, E, and F C. botulinum strains and C.  butyricum type E strains. The genomic analyses have provided evidence of  horizontal gene transfer, site-specific insertion, and recombination events.  These events have contributed to the variation observed among the neurotoxins,  the toxin gene clusters and the bacteria that contain them, and has supported  the historical microbiological, and biochemical characterization of the Group  classification within the species.', 'Tetrodotoxin (TTX) is a low molecular weight (approximately 319 Da) neurotoxin  found in a number of animal species, including pufferfish. Protection from toxin  tainted food stuffs requires rapid, sensitive, and specific diagnostic tests. An  emerging technique for the detection of both proteins and nucleic acids is  Fluidic Force Discrimination (FFD) assays. This simple and rapid method  typically uses a sandwich immunoassay format labeled with micrometer-diameter  beads and has the novel capability of removing nonspecifically attached beads  under controlled, fluidic conditions. This technique allows for near real-time,  multiplexed analysis at levels of detection that exceed many of the conventional  transduction methods (e.g., ELISAs). In addition, the large linear dynamic range  afforded by FFD should decrease the need to perform multiple sample dilutions, a  common challenge for food testing. By applying FFD assays to an inhibition  immunoassay platform specific for TTX and transduction via low magnification  microscopy, levels of detection of approximately 15 ng/mL and linear dynamic  ranges of 4 to 5 orders of magnitude were achieved. The results from these  studies on the first small molecule FFD assay, along with the impact to  detection of seafood toxins, will be discussed in this manuscript.']]]",Green toadfish Lagocephalus lunaris is associated with Tetrodotoxin.,"[{'Exact': array([53.94639354, -1.05963335,  3.49511574, -2.22027348,  1.37435922,

Does a selective sweep increase genetic variation?,"[[[""Sex and recombination are widespread, but explaining these phenomena has been  one of the most difficult problems in evolutionary biology. Recombination is  advantageous when different individuals in a population carry different  advantageous alleles. By bringing together advantageous alleles onto the same  chromosome, recombination speeds up the process of adaptation and opposes the  fixation of harmful mutations by means of Muller's ratchet. Nevertheless,  adaptive substitutions favour sex and recombination only if the rate of adaptive  mutation is high, and Muller's ratchet operates only in small or asexual  populations. Here, by tracking the fate of modifier alleles that alter the  frequency of sex and recombination, we show that background selection against  deleterious mutant alleles provides a stochastic advantage to sex and  recombination that increases with population size. The advantage arises because,  with low levels of recombination, selection at other loci severely reduces the  effective population size and genetic variance in fitness at a focal locus (the  Hill-Robertson effect), making a population less able to respond to selection  and to rid itself of deleterious mutations. Sex and recombination reveal the  hidden genetic variance in fitness by combining chromosomes of intermediate  fitness to create chromosomes that are relatively free of (or are loaded with)  deleterious mutations. This increase in genetic variance within finite  populations improves the response to selection and generates a substantial  advantage to sex and recombination that is fairly insensitive to the form of  epistatic interactions between deleterious alleles. The mechanism supported by  our results offers a robust and broadly applicable explanation for the  evolutionary advantage of recombination and can explain the spread of costly  sex."", 'A central problem in population genetics is to detect and analyze positive  natural selection by which beneficial mutations are driven to fixation. The  hitchhiking effect of a rapidly spreading beneficial mutation, which results in  local removal of standing genetic variation, allows such an analysis using DNA  sequence polymorphism. However, the current mathematical theory that predicts  the pattern of genetic hitchhiking relies on the assumption that a beneficial  mutation increases to a high frequency in a single random-mating population,  which is certainly violated in reality. Individuals in natural populations are  distributed over a geographic space. The spread of a beneficial allele can be  delayed by limited migration of individuals over the space and its hitchhiking  effect can also be affected. To study this effect of geographic structure on  genetic hitchhiking, we analyze a simple model of directional selection in a  subdivided population. In contrast to previous studies on hitchhiking in  subdivided populations, we mainly investigate the range of sufficiently high  migration rates that would homogenize genetic variation at neutral loci. We  provide a heuristic mathematical analysis that describes how the genealogical  structure at a neutral locus linked to the locus under selection is expected to  change in a population divided into two demes. Our results indicate that the  overall strength of genetic hitchhiking--the degree to which expected  heterozygosity decreases--is diminished by population subdivision, mainly  because opportunity for the breakdown of hitchhiking by recombination increases  as the spread of the beneficial mutation across demes is delayed when migration  rate is much smaller than the strength of selection. Furthermore, the amount of  genetic variation after a selective sweep is expected to be unequal over demes:  a greater reduction in expected heterozygosity occurs in the subpopulation from  which the beneficial mutation originates than in its neighboring subpopulations.  This raises a possibility of detecting a ""hidden"" geographic structure of  population by carefully analyzing the pattern of a selective sweep.', 'Chimpanzees experienced a reduction of the allelic repertoire at the major  histocompatibility complex (MHC) class I A and B loci, which may have been  caused by a retrovirus belonging to the simian immunodeficiency virus (SIV)  family. Extended MHC haplotypes were defined in a pedigreed chimpanzee colony.  Comparison of genetic variation at microsatellite markers mapping inside and  outside the Mhc region was carried out in humans and chimpanzees to investigate  the genomic extent of the repertoire reduction. Multilocus demographic analyses  underscored that chimpanzees indeed experienced a selective sweep that mainly  targeted the chromosomal segment carrying the Mhc class I region. Probably due  to genetic linkage, the sweep also affected other polymorphic loci, mapping in  the close vicinity of the Mhc class I region genes. Nevertheless, although the  allelic repertoire at particular Mhc class I and II loci appears to be limited,  naturally occurring recombination events allowed the establishment of haplotype  diversity after the sweep. However, recombination did not have sufficient time  to erase the signal of the selective sweep.', 'The controversy over the evolutionary advantage of recombination initially  discovered by Fisher and by Muller is reviewed. Those authors whose models had  finite-population effects found an advantage of recombination, and those whose  models had infinite populations found none. The advantage of recombination is  that it breaks down random linkage disequilibrium generated by genetic drift.  Hill and Robertson found that the average effect of this randomly-generated  linkage disequilibrium was to cause linked loci to interfere with each other\'s  response to selection, even where there was no gene interaction between the  loci. This effect is shown to be identical to the original argument of Fisher  and Muller. It also predicts the ""ratchet mechanism"" discovered by Muller, who  pointed out that deleterious mutants would more readily increase in a population  without recombination. Computer simulations of substitution of favorable mutants  and of the long-term increase of deleterious mutants verified the essential  correctness of the original Fisher-Muller argument and the reality of the Muller  ratchet mechanism. It is argued that these constitute an intrinsic advantage of  recombination capable of accounting for its persistence in the face of selection  for tighter linkage between interacting polymorphisms, and possibly capable of  accounting for its origin.', 'We investigated DNA sequence diversity for loci on chromosomes 1 and 2 in six  natural populations of Arabidopsis lyrata and tested for the role of natural  selection in structuring genomewide patterns of variability, specifically  examining the effects of recombination rate on levels of silent polymorphism. In  contrast with theoretical predictions from models of genetic hitchhiking,  maximum-likelihood-based analyses of diversity and divergence do not suggest  reduction of diversity in the region of suppressed recombination near the  centromere of chromosome 1, except in a single population from Russia, in which  the pericentromeric region may have undergone a local selective sweep or  demographic process that reduced variability. We discuss various possibilities  that might explain why nucleotide diversity in most A. lyrata populations is not  related to recombination rate, including genic recombination hotspots, and low  gene density in the low recombination rate region.', 'Many domestic dog breeds have originated through fixation of discrete mutations  by intense artificial selection. As a result of this process, markers in the  proximity of genes influencing breed-defining traits will have reduced variation  (a selective sweep) and will show divergence in allele frequency. Consequently,  low-resolution genomic scans can potentially be used to identify regions  containing genes that have a major influence on breed-defining traits. We model  the process of breed formation and show that the probability of two or three  adjacent marker loci showing a spurious signal of selection within at least one  breed (i.e., Type I error or false-positive rate) is low if highly variable and  moderately spaced markers are utilized. We also use simulations with selection  to demonstrate that even a moderately spaced set of highly polymorphic markers  (e.g., one every 0.8 cM) has high power to detect regions targeted by strong  artificial selection in dogs. Further, we show that a gene responsible for black  coat color in the Large Munsterlander has a 40-Mb region surrounding the gene  that is very low in heterozygosity for microsatellite markers. Similarly, we  survey 302 microsatellite markers in the Dachshund and find three linked  monomorphic microsatellite markers all within a 10-Mb region on chromosome 3.  This region contains the FGFR3 gene, which is responsible for achondroplasia in  humans, but not in dogs. Consequently, our results suggest that the causative  mutation is a gene or regulatory region closely linked to FGFR3.', 'The production performance of pigs has been significantly improved due to  long-term artificial selection, and the specific variation characterizations  (selection signatures) emerged from the selected genome regions. Different types  of breeds are subjected to different selection intensities and had different  selection signatures. Selective sweep analysis is one of major methods to detect  the selection signatures. In this study, based on the 60K BeadChip genotyping  data of both commercial Large White (n=45) and local Tongcheng pigs (n=45),  genetic differentiation coefficient Fst was applied to detect the selection  signatures. Using gPLINK software to set quality control standards, a total of  34 304 SNPs were selected for statistical analysis. Fst values between two  breeds were estimated with Genepop package and the average Fst value was 0.3209.  Setting Fst>0.7036 (1% of total number of Fst values) as selection threshold,  344 SNPs were obtained and SNP location annotation indicated that there were 79  candidate genes (Sus scrofa Build 9). Furthermore, network analysis was  performed using Ingenuity Pathway Analysis and the preliminary results suggested  that most genes were involved in growth, reproduction, and immune response, such  as NCOA6, ERBB4, RUNX2, and APOB genes. The findings from this study will  contribute to further identification of candidate genes and causal mutations  implying for meat production and disease resistance in pig.', 'We investigated DNA sequence diversity for loci on chromosomes 1 and 2 in six  natural populations of Arabidopsis lyrata and tested for the role of natural  selection in structuring genomewide patterns of variability, specifically  examining the effects of recombination rate on levels of silent polymorphism.

The  loci controlling such patterns are ""hotspots"" for adaptive evolution with great  allelic diversity across different species in the genus. We characterise  nucleotide variation, genotype-by-phenotype associations, linkage  disequilibrium, and candidate gene expression at two loci and across multiple  hybrid zones in Heliconius melpomene and relatives. Alleles at HmB control the  presence or absence of the red forewing band, while alleles at HmYb control the  yellow hindwing bar. Across HmYb two regions, separated by approximately 100 kb,  show significant genotype-by-phenotype associations that are replicated across  independent hybrid zones. In contrast, at HmB a single peak of association  indicates the likely position of functional sites at three genes, encoding a  kinesin, a G-protein coupled receptor, and an mRNA splicing factor. At both HmYb  and HmB there is evidence for enhanced linkage disequilibrium (LD) between  associated sites separated by up to 14 kb, suggesting that multiple sites are  under selection. However, there was no evidence for reduced variation or  deviations from neutrality that might indicate a recent selective sweep,  consistent with these alleles being relatively old. Of the three genes showing  an association with the HmB locus, the kinesin shows differences in wing disc  expression between races that are replicated in the co-mimic, Heliconius erato,  providing striking evidence for parallel changes in gene expression between  Müllerian co-mimics. Wing patterning loci in Heliconius melpomene therefore show  a haplotype structure maintained by selection, but no evidence for a recent  selective sweep. The complex genetic pattern contrasts with the simple genetic  basis of many adaptive traits studied previously, but may provide a better model  for most adaptation in natural populations that has arisen over millions rather  than tens of years.', 'The positive selection of a nucleotide substitution in exon 2 of Plasmodium  falciparum chloroquine resistance transporter (pfcrt) gene (mutation responsible  for chloroquine resistance) causes a reduction in variation of neutral loci  close to the gene. This reduction in allelic diversity around flanking regions  of pfcrt gene was reported in worldwide chloroquine resistant isolates and  referred as selective sweep. In Plasmodium falciparum isolates of India, the  selective sweep in flanking loci of pfcrt gene is well established, however,  high allelic diversity observed in intragenic microsatellites of pfcrt gene  implied an ongoing genetic recombination. To understand, if molecular evolution  of chloroquine-resistant P. falciparum isolates in India follow a selective  sweep model, we analyzed genetic diversity at both seven intragenic and seven  flanking microsatellites of pfcrt (-24 to +106kb) gene in chloroquine sensitive  and resistant parasites originating from high and low transmission areas. We  observed low expected heterozygosity at all loci of resistant pfcrt-haplotypes  (He=0-0.77) compared to the wild-type (He=0.38-0.96). Resistant SVMNT from high  transmission areas showed significantly higher mean He (P=0.03, t-test) at both  intragenic and pfcrt-flanking loci (-24 to +22 kb) in comparison to low  transmission areas. Our observation of reduction in variation at both intragenic  and flanking loci of mutant pfcrt gene confirmed the selective sweep model of  natural selection in chloroquine resistant P. falciparum isolates in India.']]]","No, a selective sweep does not increase genetic variation. Instead, it reduces genetic variation in the region of the gene under selection. The text mentions that a selective sweep causes a reduction in allelic diversity around the gene, indicating a decrease in genetic variation.","[{'Exact': array([ 3.90629101,  0.58383514,  1.42741088,  1.24069754,  2.90130063,

List markers for autophagy.,"[[['Ovarian cancer is a leading cause of cancer death in women in the United States.  While the majority of ovarian cancers are serous, some rarer subtypes (i.e.  clear cell) are often associated with endometriosis, a benign gynecological  disease. Iron is rich in the cyst fluid of endometriosis-associated ovarian  cancers and induces persistent oxidative stress. The role of iron, an essential  nutrient involved in multiple cellular functions, in normal ovarian cell  survival and ovarian cancer remains unclear. Iron, presented as ferric ammonium  citrate (FAC), dramatically inhibits cell survival in ovarian cancer cell types  associated with Ras mutations, while it is without effect in immortalized normal  ovarian surface epithelial (T80) and endometriotic epithelial cells (lacking Ras  mutations). Interestingly, FAC induced changes in cytoplasmic vacuolation  concurrently with increases in LC3-II levels (an autophagy marker); these  changes occurred in an ATG5/ATG7-dependent, beclin-1/hVps34-independent, and  Ras-independent manner. Knockdown of autophagy mediators in HEY ovarian cancer  cells reversed FAC-induced LC3-II levels, but there was little effect on  reversing the cell death response. Intriguingly, transmission electron  microscopy of FAC-treated T80 cells demonstrated abundant lysosomes (confirmed  using Lysotracker) rich in iron particles, which occurred in a Ras-independent  manner. Although the mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) inhibitor, U0126,  reversed FAC-induced LC3-II/autophagic punctae and lysosomes in a  Ras-independent manner, it was remarkable that U0126 reversed cell death in  malignant ovarian cells associated with Ras mutations. Moreover, FAC increased  heme oxygenase-1 expression in H-Ras-overexpressing T80 cells, which was  associated with increased cell death when overexpressed in T80 cells. Disruption  of intracellular iron levels, via chelation of intracellular iron  (deferoxamine), was also detrimental to malignant ovarian cell survival; thus,  homeostatic intracellular iron levels are essential for cell survival.  Collectively, our results implicate iron in modulating cell death in a Ras- and  MAPK-dependent manner in ovarian cancer cells.', 'Chlamydia trachomatis is an obligate intracellular bacterium responsible for one  of the most common sexually transmitted diseases. In epithelial cells, C.  trachomatis resides in a modified membrane-bound vacuole known as an inclusion,  which is isolated from the endocytic pathway. However, the maturation process of  C. trachomatis within immune cells, such as macrophages, has not been studied  extensively. Here, we demonstrated that RAW macrophages effectively suppressed  C. trachomatis growth and prevented Golgi stack disruption, a hallmark defect in  epithelial cells after C. trachomatis infection. Next, we systematically  examined association between C. trachomatis and various endocytic pathway  markers. Spinning disk confocal time-lapse studies revealed significant and  rapid association between C. trachomatis with Rab7 and LAMP1, markers of late  endosomes and lysosomes. Moreover, pretreatment with an inhibitor of lysosome  acidification led to significant increases in C. trachomatis growth in  macrophages. At later stages of infection, C. trachomatis associated with the  autophagy marker LC3. TEM analysis confirmed that a significant portion of C.  trachomatis resided within double-membrane-bound compartments, characteristic of  autophagosomes. Together, these results suggest that macrophages can suppress C.  trachomatis growth by targeting it rapidly to lysosomes; moreover, autophagy is  activated at later stages of infection and targets significant numbers of the  invading bacteria, which may enhance subsequent chlamydial antigen presentation.', 'Preischemic hyperglycemia exacerbates brain damage caused by cerebral ischemia.  In the present experiment, we studied the effects of preischemic hyperglycemia  on protein markers that are related to mitochondrial fission and fusion,  mitochondrial biogenesis, and autophagy in mice subjected to 30-min transient  focal ischemia. The fission proteins dynamin-related protein 1 (Drp1) and  fission 1 (Fis1), fusion proteins optic atrophy 1 (Opa1) and mitofusin 2 (Mfn2),  mitochondrial biogenesis regulators nuclear respiratory factor 1 (NRF1) and  peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor gamma coactivator 1-alpha (PGC-1α),  and autophagy marker beclin 1 and microtubule-associated protein light chain 3  (LC3) were analyzed in control, 30 min middle cerebral artery occlusion (MCAO)  plus 6-, 24-, and 72 h of reperfusion in normo- and hyperglycemic conditions.  Cerebral ischemia increased the levels of Drp1 and decreased Fis1 after  reperfusion. Preischemic hyperglycemia further augmented the increase of Drp1  and induced elevation in Fis1. Ischemia inhibited the levels of Opa1 and Mfn2  and hyperglycemia further decreased the level of Opa1. Further, NRF1 increased  after reperfusion in both normo- and hyperglycemic animals. However, such  increase was caused by reperfusion rather than glucose level. Finally, ischemia  increased beclin 1 level at 6 and 24 h of reperfusion and hyperglycemia further  increased the beclin 1 level and caused LC3-II increase as well. Hyperglycemia  enhances the ischemia-induced mitochondrial dynamic imbalance towards fission  that may favor mitochondrial fragmentation and subsequent damage. Hyperglycemia  elevated autophagy markers may represent an adapting reaction to the severe  damage incurred in hyperglycemic animals or a third pathway of cell death.', 'Equine arteritis virus (EAV) is an enveloped, positive-strand RNA virus. Genome  replication of EAV has been associated with modified intracellular membranes  that are shaped into double-membrane vesicles (DMVs). We showed by  immuno-electron microscopy that the DMVs induced in EAV-infected cells contain  double-strand (ds)RNA molecules, presumed RNA replication intermediates, and are  decorated with the autophagy marker protein microtubule-associated protein 1  light chain 3 (LC3). Replication of EAV, however, was not affected in  autophagy-deficient cells lacking autophagy-related protein 7 (ATG7).  Nevertheless, colocalization of DMVs and LC3 was still observed in these  knockout cells, which only contain the nonlipidated form of LC3. Although  autophagy is not required, depletion of LC3 markedly reduced the replication of  EAV. EAV replication could be fully restored in these cells by expression of a  nonlipidated form of LC3. These findings demonstrate an autophagy-independent  role for LC3 in EAV replication. Together with the observation that EAV-induced  DMVs are also positive for ER degradation-enhancing α-mannosidase-like 1  (EDEM1), our data suggested that this virus, similarly to the distantly-related  mouse hepatitis coronavirus, hijacks the ER-derived membranes of EDEMosomes to  ensure its efficient replication.', 'Macroautophagy (hereafter referred to as autophagy) is an evolutionarily  conserved catabolic process necessary for normal recycling of cellular  constituents and for appropriate response to cellular stress. Although several  genes belonging to the core molecular machinery involved in autophagosome  formation have been discovered, relatively little is known about the nature of  signaling networks controlling autophagy upon intracellular or extracellular  stimuli. We discovered ATG8-like proteins (MAP1LC3B, GABARAP and GABARAPL1) as  novel interactors of MAPK15/ERK8, a MAP kinase involved in cell proliferation  and transformation. Based on the role of these proteins in the autophagic  process, we demonstrated that MAPK15 is indeed localized to autophagic  compartments and increased, in a kinase-dependent fashion, ATG8-like proteins  lipidation, autophagosome formation and SQSTM1 degradation, while decreasing  LC3B inhibitory phosphorylation. Interestingly, we also identified a conserved  LC3-interacting region (LIR) in MAPK15 responsible for its interaction with  ATG8-like proteins, for its localization to autophagic structures and,  consequently, for stimulation of the formation of these compartments.  Furthermore, we reveal that MAPK15 activity was induced in response to serum and  amino-acid starvation and that this stimulus, in turn, required endogenous  MAPK15 expression to induce the autophagic process. Altogether, these results  suggested a new function for MAPK15 as a regulator of autophagy, acting through  interaction with ATG8 family proteins. Also, based on the key role of this  process in several human diseases, these results supported the use of this MAP  kinase as a potential novel therapeutic target.', 'Mitochondria autophagy (mitophagy) is the process of selective degradation of  mitochondria that has an important role in mitochondrial quality control. To  gain insight into the molecular mechanism of mitophagy, we screened a yeast  knockout library for strains that are defective in mitophagy. We found 32  strains that showed a complete or partial block of mitophagy. One of the genes  identified, YLR356W, is required for mitophagy, but not for macroautophagy or  other types of selective autophagy. The deletion of YLR356W partially inhibits  mitophagy during starvation, whereas there is almost complete inhibition at  post-log phase. Accordingly, we hypothesize that Ylr356w is required to detect  or present aged or dysfunctional mitochondria when cells reach the post-log  phase.', 'Oncogene-induced senescence (OIS) is a highly dynamic process, involving several  different effector mechanisms, the multitude and combination of which likely  determines the quality of the phenotype (Pérez-Mancera et al., Nat Rev Cancer  14:547-558, 2014). Autophagy, a cellular degradation process, has been proposed  to be one of these senescence effectors, although its functional relevance seems  highly context dependent (Hoare et al., Semin Cancer Biol 21:397-404, 2011). A  number of methods for monitoring autophagy are available, and several excellent  protocols have been published in this journal (Klionsky et al., Autophagy  8:445-544, 2012; Tooze et al., Methods Mol Biol 1270:155-165, 2015; Tabata et  al., Methods Mol Biol 931:449-466, 2013; Young and Tooze, Methods Mol Biol  445:147-157, 2008). The same principles apply to models of OIS in culture. Thus,  in this chapter, we describe how to generate OIS cells using human diploid  fibroblasts (HDFs), the best-characterized cell model of OIS, and how to detect  autophagy, particularly focusing on immunofluorescence methods.', 'Autophagy is an important catabolic process with roles in cell survival and cell  death. It sequesters cytosol and organelles within double-membrane  autophagosomes that deliver their contents to lysosomes for degradation.  Autophagosome biogenesis is coordinated by the autophagy-related protein 4  (Atg4) family of C54 endopeptidases (Atg4A-Atg4D). These enzymes prime and then  later delipidate the autophagosome marker, Atg8. Here, we show that one family  member, Atg4D, is cleaved by caspase-3 in vitro and in apoptotic cells. Atg4D is  a poor priming and delipidation enzyme in vitro, but truncated DeltaN63 Atg4D  displays increased activity against the Atg8 paralogue, gamma-aminobutyric acid  receptor-associated protein-like 1 (GABARAP-L1). In living cells, DeltaN63 Atg4D  stimulates the delipidation of GABARAP-L1, whereas siRNA silencing of the gene  expressing Atg4D abrogates GABARAP-L1 autophagosome formation and sensitises  cells to starvation and staurosporine-induced cell death. Interestingly, Atg4D  overexpression induces apoptosis, which is preceded by the caspase-independent  recruitment of Atg4D to mitochondria and is facilitated by a putative C-terminal  Bcl-2 homology 3 (BH3) domain. Atg4D also acquires affinity for damaged  mitochondria in cells treated with hydrogen peroxide. These data suggest that  Atg4D is an autophagy regulator that links mitochondrial dysfunction with  apoptosis.', ""AIM: To investigate the effects of mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR)  inhibition on liver regeneration and autophagy in a surgical resection model. METHODS: C57BL/6 mice were subjected to a 70% partial hepatectomy (PH) and  treated intraperitoneally every 24 h with a combination of the mTOR inhibitor  rapamycin (2.5 mg/kg per day) and the steroid dexamethasone (2.0 mg/kg per day)  in phosphate buffered saline (PBS) or with PBS alone as vehicle control. In the  immunosuppressant group, part of the group was treated subcutaneously 4 h prior  to and 24 h after PH with a combination of human recombinant interleukin 6  (IL-6; 500 μg/kg per day) and hepatocyte growth factor (HGF; 100 μg/kg per day)  in PBS. Animals were sacrificed 2, 3 or 5 d after PH and liver tissue and blood  were collected for further analysis. Immunohistochemical staining for  5-Bromo-2'-deoxyuridine (BrdU) was used to quantify hepatocyte proliferation.  Western blotting was used to detect hepatic microtubule-associated protein 1  light chain 3 (LC3)-II protein expression as a marker for autophagy. Hepatic  gene expression levels of proliferation-, inflammation- and angiogenesis-related  genes were examined by real-time reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction  and serum bilirubin and transaminase levels were analyzed at the clinical  chemical core facility of the Erasmus MC-University Medical Center. RESULTS: mTOR inhibition significantly suppressed regeneration, shown by  decreased hepatocyte proliferation (2% vs 12% BrdU positive hepatocyte nuclei at  day 2, P < 0.01; 0.8% vs 1.4% at day 5, P = 0.02) and liver weight  reconstitution (63% vs 76% of initial total liver weight at day 3, P = 0.04),  and furthermore increased serum transaminase levels (aspartate aminotransferase  641 U/L vs 185 U/L at day 2, P = 0.02). Expression of the autophagy marker  LC3-II, which was reduced during normal liver regeneration, increased after mTOR  inhibition (46% increase at day 2, P = 0.04). Hepatic gene expression showed an  increased inflammation-related response [tumor necrosis factor (TNF)-α 3.2-fold  upregulation at day 2, P = 0.03; IL-1Ra 6.0-fold upregulation at day 2 and  42.3-fold upregulation at day 5, P < 0.01] and a reduced expression of cell  cycle progression and angiogenesis-related factors (HGF 40% reduction at day 2;  vascular endothelial growth factor receptor 2 50% reduction at days 2 and 5;  angiopoietin 1 60% reduction at day 2, all P ≤ 0.01). Treatment with the  regeneration stimulating cytokine IL-6 and growth factor HGF could overcome the  inhibitory effect on liver weight (75% of initial total liver weight at day 3, P  = 0.02 vs immunosuppression alone and P = 0.90 vs controls) and partially  reversed gene expression changes caused by rapamycin (TNF-α and IL-1Ra levels at  day 2 were restored to control levels). However, no significant changes in  hepatocyte proliferation, serum injury markers or autophagy were found. CONCLUSION: mTOR inhibition severely impairs liver regeneration and increases  autophagy after PH. These effects are partly reversed by stimulation of the IL-6  and HGF pathways."", 'There is growing evidence that macroautophagic cargo is not limited to bulk  cytosol in response to starvation and can occur selectively for substrates,  including aggregated proteins. It remains unclear, however, whether  starvation-induced and selective macroautophagy share identical adaptor  molecules to capture their cargo. Here, we report that Alfy, a  phosphatidylinositol 3-phosphate-binding protein, is central to the selective  elimination of aggregated proteins. We report that the loss of Alfy inhibits the  clearance of inclusions, with little to no effect on the starvation response.  Alfy is recruited to intracellular inclusions and scaffolds a complex between  p62(SQSTM1)-positive proteins and the autophagic effectors Atg5, Atg12, Atg16L,  and LC3. Alfy overexpression leads to elimination of aggregates in an  Atg5-dependent manner and, likewise, to protection in a neuronal and Drosophila  model of polyglutamine toxicity. We propose that Alfy plays a key role in  selective macroautophagy by bridging cargo to the molecular machinery that  builds autophagosomes.']]]","Markers for autophagy mentioned in the text include:

Can a circRNA be translated into protein?,"[[['Circular RNAs (circRNAs) represent a large class of noncoding RNAs (ncRNAs) that  have recently emerged as regulators of gene expression. They have been shown to  suppress microRNAs, thereby increasing the translation and stability of the  targets of such microRNAs. In this review, we discuss the emerging functions of  circRNAs, including RNA transcription, splicing, turnover, and translation. We  also discuss other possible facets of circRNAs that can influence their function  depending on the cell context, such as circRNA abundance, subcellular  localization, interacting partners (RNA, DNA, and proteins), dynamic changes in  interactions following stimulation, and potential circRNA translation. The  ensuing changes in gene expression patterns elicited by circRNAs are proposed to  drive key cellular processes, such as cell proliferation, differentiation, and  survival, that govern health and disease. WIREs RNA 2017, 8:e1386. doi:  10.1002/wrna.1386 For further resources related to this article, please visit  the WIREs website.', 'Circular RNAs are found in a wide range of organisms and it has been proposed  that they perform disparate functions. However, how RNA circularization is  connected to alternative splicing remains largely unexplored. Here, we  stimulated primary human endothelial cells with tumor necrosis factor α or tumor  growth factor β, purified RNA, generated >2.4 billion RNA-seq reads, and used a  custom pipeline to characterize circular RNAs derived from coding exons. We find  that circularization of exons is widespread and correlates with exon skipping, a  feature that adds considerably to the regulatory complexity of the human  transcriptome.', 'Circular RNAs (circRNAs) are long, non-coding RNAs that result from the  non-canonical splicing of linear pre-mRNAs. However, the characteristics and the  critical role of circRNA in co-/post-transcriptional regulation were not well  recognized until the ""microRNA sponge"" function of circRNA is discovered. Recent  studies have mainly been devoted to the function of the circular RNA sponge for  miR-7 (ciRS-7) and sex-determining region Y (SRY) by targeting microRNA-7  (miR-7) and microRNA-138 (miR-138), respectively. In this review, we illustrate  the specific role of circRNAs in a wide variety of cancers and in regulating the  biological behavior of cancers via miR-7 or miR-138 regulation. Furthermore,  circRNA, together with its gene silencing ability, also shows its potential in  RNA interference (RNAi) therapy by binding to target RNAs, which provides a  novel perspective in cancer treatment. Thus, this review concerns the  biogenesis, biological function, oncogenesis, progression and possible therapies  for cancer involving circRNAs.', 'Circular RNAs (circRNAs) are abundant and evolutionarily conserved RNAs of  largely unknown function. Here, we show that a subset of circRNAs is translated  in\xa0vivo. By performing ribosome footprinting from fly heads, we demonstrate that  a group of circRNAs is associated with translating ribosomes. Many of these  ribo-circRNAs use the start codon of the hosting mRNA, are bound by  membrane-associated ribosomes, and have evolutionarily conserved termination  codons. In addition, we found that a circRNA generated from the muscleblind  locus encodes a protein, which we detected in fly head extracts by mass  spectrometry. Next, by performing in\xa0vivo and in\xa0vitro translation assays, we  show that UTRs of ribo-circRNAs (cUTRs) allow cap-independent translation.  Moreover, we found that starvation and FOXO likely regulate the translation of a  circMbl isoform. Altogether, our study provides strong evidence for translation  of circRNAs, revealing the existence of an unexplored layer of gene activity.', 'Circular RNAs (circRNAs) are highly abundant and evolutionarily conserved  non-coding RNAs produced by circularization of specific exons. Since their  re-discovery as potential regulators of gene expression, thousands of circRNAs  were detected in different tissues and cell types across most organisms.  Accumulating data suggest key roles for them in the central nervous system.  Neuronal-expressed RNAs are diverted to yield highly enriched CircRNAs in human,  mouse, pig and flies, with many of them enriched in neuronal tissues. CircRNA  levels are dynamically modulated in neurons, both during differentiation and  following bursts of electrical activity, and accumulate with age, and many of  them are enriched in synapses. Together, available data suggest that circRNAs  have important roles in synaptic plasticity and neuronal function. This review  covers current advances in the field and lays out hypotheses regarding functions  of circRNAs in the brain as well as their putative involvement in initiation and  progression of neurodegenerative processes.', 'Insights into the circular RNA (circRNA) exploration have revealed that they are  abundant in eukaryotic transcriptomes. Diverse genomic regions can generate  different types of RNA circles, implying their diversity. Covalently closed loop  structures elevate the stability of this new type of noncoding RNA.  High-throughput sequencing analyses suggest that circRNAs exhibit tissue- and  developmental-specific expression, indicating that they may play crucial roles  in multiple cellular processes. Strikingly, several circRNAs could function as  microRNA sponges and regulate gene transcription, highlighting a new class of  important regulators. Here, we review the recent advances in knowledge of  endogenous circRNA biogenesis, properties and functions. We further discuss the  current findings about circRNAs in human diseases. In plants, the roles of  circRNAs remain a mystery. Online resources and bioinformatics identification of  circRNAs are essential for the analysis of circRNA biology, although different  strategies yield divergent results. The understanding of circRNA functions  remains limited; however, circRNAs are enriching the RNA world, acting as an  emerging key player.', 'Circular RNAs (circRNAs) are being hailed as a newly rediscovered class of  covalently closed transcripts that are produced via alternative, noncanonical  pre-mRNA back-splicing events. These single-stranded RNA molecules have been  identified in organisms ranging from the worm (Cortés-López et al. 2018. BMC  Genomics, 19: 8; Ivanov et al. 2015. Cell Rep. 10: 170-177) to higher eukaryotes  (Yang et al. 2017. Cell Res. 27: 626-641) to plants (Li et al. 2017. Biochem.  Biophys. Res. Commun. 488: 382-386). At present, research on circRNAs is an  active area because of their diverse roles in development, health, and diseases.  Partly because their circularity makes them resistant to degradation, they hold  great promise as unique biomarkers for ocular and central nervous system (CNS)  disorders. We believe that further work on their applications could help in  developing them as ""first-in-class"" diagnostics, therapeutics, and prognostic  targets for numerous eye conditions. Interestingly, many circRNAs play key roles  in transcriptional regulation by acting as miRNAs sponges, meaning that they  serve as master regulators of RNA and protein expression. Since the retina is an  extension of the brain and is part of the CNS, we highlight the current state of  circRNA biogenesis, properties, and function and we review the crucial roles  that they play in the eye and the brain. We also discuss their regulatory roles  as miRNA sponges, regulation of their parental genes or linear mRNAs,  translation into micropeptides or proteins, and responses to cellular stress. We  posit that future advances will provide newer insights into the fields of RNA  metabolism in general and diseases of the aging eye and brain in particular.

Emerging roles in diverse biological processes  suggest that circRNA is a promising key player in RNA world. Most circRNAs are  generated through back-splicing of pre-mRNAs, forming a covalently closed loop  structure with no 5' caps or 3' polyadenylated tails. In addition, most circRNAs  were not associated with translating ribosomes, therefore, circRNAs were deemed  to be noncoding. However, the latest research findings revealed that some  circRNAs could generate proteins in vivo, which expands the landscape of  transcriptome and proteome. To gain insights into the new area of circRNA  translation, we introduce an integrated tool capable of detecting circRNAs with  protein-coding potential from high-throughput sequencing data.

CircRNAs were previously thought to  be the byproducts of splicing errors caused by low abundance and the  technological limitations.

Recent studies have revealed that circRNAs are stable and widely expressed, and  often exhibit cell type-specific or tissue-specific expression. Most circRNAs  can be generated from exons, introns, or both. Remarkably, emerging evidence  indicates that some circRNAs can serve as microRNA (miRNA) sponges, regulate  transcription or splicing, and can interact with RNA binding proteins (RBPs).  Moreover, circRNAs have been reported to play essential roles in myriad life  processes, such as aging, insulin secretion, tissue development, atherosclerotic  vascular disease risk, cardiac hypertrophy and cancer. Although circRNAs are  ancient molecules, they represent a newly appreciated form of noncoding RNA and  as such have great potential implications in clinical and research fields.

HIV  pre-exposure prophylaxis (PrEP) is a new approach that involves the ongoing use  of antiretroviral medications by HIV-negative individuals to reduce the risk of  HIV infection. The use of daily tenofovir/emtricitabine as oral PrEP was found  to be effective in multiple placebo-controlled clinical trials and approved by  the United States Food and Drug Administration. In addition, the Centers for  Disease Control and Prevention in the United States and the World Health  Organization have both released guidelines recommending the offer of oral PrEP  to high-risk populations. The scale-up of PrEP is underway, but several  implementation questions remain unanswered. Demonstration projects and  open-label extensions of placebo-controlled trials are ongoing and hope to  contribute to our understanding of PrEP use and delivery outside the randomized  controlled trial setting. Evidence is beginning to emerge from these open-label  studies and will be critical for guiding PrEP scale-up. Outside of such studies,  PrEP uptake has been slow and several client- and provider-related barriers are  limiting uptake. Maximizing the public health impact of PrEP will require  rollout to be combined with interventions to promote uptake, support adherence,  and prevent increases in risk behavior. Additional PrEP strategies are currently  under investigation in placebo-controlled clinical trials and may be available  in the future.', 'BACKGROUND: The potential impact of antiretroviral therapy (ART) and  pre-exposure prophylaxis (PrEP) with overlapping and nonoverlapping  antiretrovirals (ARVs) on human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) transmission and  drug resistance is unknown. METHODS: A detailed mathematical model was used to simulate the epidemiological  impact of ART alone, PrEP alone, and combined ART + PrEP in South Africa. RESULTS: ART alone initiated at a CD4 lymphocyte cell count <200 cells/µL (80%  coverage and 96% effectiveness) prevents 20% of HIV infections over 10 years but  increases drug resistance prevalence to 6.6%. PrEP alone (30% coverage and 75%  effectiveness) also prevents 21% of infections but with lower resistance  prevalence of 0.5%. The ratio of cumulative infections prevented to prevalent  drug-resistant cases after 10 years is 7-fold higher for PrEP than for ART.  Combined ART + PrEP with overlapping ARVs prevents 35% of infections but  increases resistance prevalence to 8.2%, whereas ART + PrEP with nonoverlapping  ARVs prevents slightly more infections (37%) and reduces resistance prevalence  to 7.2%. CONCLUSIONS: Combined ART + PrEP is likely to prevent more HIV infections than  either strategy alone, but with higher prevalence of drug resistance. ART is  predicted to contribute more to resistance than is PrEP. Optimizing both ART and  PrEP effectiveness and delivery are the keys to preventing HIV transmission and  drug resistance.', 'INTRODUCTION: Use of pre-exposure prophylaxis (PrEP) among people who inject  drugs (PWID) has been shown to be effective in preventing HIV transmission. We  examined correlates of the willingness to use PrEP among community-recruited  older PWID in Washington, DC. METHODS: PWID were recruited using respondent-driven sampling (RDS) and  completed a behavioral interview for the National HIV Behavioral Surveillance  system in 2012. Participants reported on willingness to use PrEP and how it  might affect their drug use and sexual behaviors. We reported RDS-weighted  proportions and multivariable correlates of being willing to use PrEP. RESULTS: Among 304 participants, 69% were male, and the majority was aged ≥50  and black. Only 13.4% had ever heard of using anti-HIV medication to prevent  HIV; none had ever used PrEP or knew anyone who used it in the past year.  Forty-seven percent were very likely and 24% were somewhat likely to take PrEP  if it were available without cost; 13% agreed they would not need to  sterilize/clean needles or use condoms if taking PrEP. Correlates of being very  likely to use PrEP included being younger (<50years), sharing cookers, cotton or  water in the past year, and believing they would no longer need to use clean  needles. CONCLUSION: Nearly half of PWID reported being very willing to use PrEP if it  were available without cost. Younger PWID and those at higher risk of sharing  cookers, cotton or water were more willing to use PrEP, suggesting a focus on  these groups to explore PrEP use among PWID.', 'BACKGROUND: Although effective, some oral pre-exposure prophylaxis (PrEP) users  face barriers to adherence using daily pills, which could be reduced by  long-acting formulations. Long-acting cabotegravir (CAB LA) is a potential new  injectable formulation for human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) PrEP being tested  in phase III trials. METHODS: We use a mathematical model of the HIV epidemic in South Africa to  simulate CAB LA uptake by population groups with different levels of HIV risk.  We compare the trajectory of the HIV epidemic until 2050 with and without CAB LA  to estimate the impact of the intervention. RESULTS: Delivering CAB LA to 10% of the adult population could avert more than  15% of new infections from 2023 to 2050. The impact would be lower but more  efficient if delivered to populations at higher HIV risk: 127 person-years of  CAB LA use would be required to avert one HIV infection within 5 years if used  by all adults and 47 person-years if used only by the highest risk women. CONCLUSIONS: If efficacious, a CAB LA intervention could have a substantial  impact on the course of the HIV epidemic in South Africa. Uptake by those at the  highest risk of infection, particularly young women, could improve the  efficiency of any intervention.', ""HIV pre-exposure prophylaxis (PrEP) is the use of one or more antiretroviral  medications (in combination) to prevent HIV infection. The most commonly used  PrEP medication (Truvada® , Gilead Sciences, Inc.) acts by inhibiting HIV-1  reverse transcriptase. If someone who is using PrEP unknowingly becomes HIV  infected (termed 'PrEP breakthrough infection'), there may be suppressed viral  replication resulting in a virus level undetectable by the most sensitive HIV  NAT. Failure to seroconvert and seroreversion (loss of previously detectable HIV  antibodies) have also both been observed with 2nd, 3rd and 4th generation  screening immunoassays, as well as Western blot assays. If such a person was  tested in the course of donating blood, the results may therefore be difficult  to interpret. The index of suspicion for possible PrEP 'interference' should be  highest in the context of concomitant low-level positive or 'greyzone'  reactivity on HIV NAT and serological tests, which is an unusual pattern in  acutely HIV-infected blood donors. Another possibility is detectable HIV RNA  with negative HIV serology (i.e. a potential 'NAT yield' case) but without  subsequent HIV seroconversion (or disappearance of HIV RNA). Excluding  antiretroviral therapy or PrEP use by the donor in such circumstances would be  important. The current rarity of PrEP breakthrough infection indicates that any  potential safety risk is likely very small. However, considering the increasing  use of PrEP we feel it is prudent for those interpreting HIV donor screening  test results to consider the potential for PrEP interference."", 'The retrovirus HIV-1 is the etiological agent of the decades-long AIDS pandemic.  Although vaccination is the most common preexposure route to prevent acquisition  of viral disease, scalable efficacious vaccination strategies have yet to be  developed for HIV-1. By contrast, small molecule inhibitors of the HIV-1 enzymes  reverse transcriptase, integrase, and protease have been developed that  effectively block virus replication. Three different drug compounds are commonly  prescribed for people living with HIV as once-daily oral tablets. Once-daily  pills composed of two different reverse transcriptase inhibitors are moreover  approved as preexposure prophylaxis (PrEP) treatment for virus naïve individuals  who may partake in behaviors associated with increased risk of HIV-1 acquisition  such as unprotected sex or injection drug use. Long-acting (LA) injectable HIV-1  enzyme inhibitors are at the same time being developed to sidestep adherence  noncompliance issues that can arise from self-administered once-daily oral  dosing regimens. Cabotegravir (CAB)-LA, which inhibits integrase strand transfer  activity, has in recent clinical trials been shown to prevent HIV-1 acquisition  more effectively than once-daily oral dosed reverse transcriptase inhibitors. In  this Perspective, we examine bench to bedside aspects of CAB-LA treatment and  development, starting from the biochemical basis of HIV-1 integration and  pharmacological inhibition of integrase catalysis. We also review the results of  recent clinical trials that evaluated CAB-LA, as well as the promises and  challenges that surround its use for HIV/AIDS PrEP.', 'Introduction: Oral pre-exposure prophylaxis (PrEP) and antiretroviral therapy  (ART) represent the cornerstones of HIV infection prevention and treatment.  However, despite their high efficacy, the need to take daily oral pill(s)  negatively impacts long-term patient adherence. In some cases, it can also be  associated with drug-drug interactions and adverse gastrointestinal effects, as  well as being a constant reminder to individuals of their HIV status. The  availability of long-acting non-orally administered antiretroviral drugs could,  therefore, be extremely useful. Cabotegravir (CAB) is a second-generation  integrase strand transfer inhibitor, characterized by a relatively high genetic  barrier and good antiretroviral potency, which is administrable as a long-acting  injectable suspension (LAI CAB).Areas covered: The authors present and discuss  the efficacy and available safety data of LAI CAB, either when co-administered  with rilpivirine (RPV; LAI CAB + RPV) for the treatment of HIV infection, or  when used as single agent for PrEP.Expert opinion: Cabotegravir has the  potential to play a primary role in the treatment and prevention of HIV  infection. The future availability of LAI CAB + RPV and LAI CAB may mark the  beginning of an era of LAI ART and PrEP, respectively.', ""Author information: (1)Department of Genitourinary Medicine and Infectious Disease, Guys and St  Thomas' NHS Trust, London, UK. julie.fox@kcl.ac.uk.

We used a macaque  model of HIV transmission to investigate if Truvada maintains prophylactic  efficacy against an FTC-resistant isolate containing the M184V mutation. Five  macaques received a dose of Truvada 3 days before exposing them rectally to the  simian/human immunodeficiency virus mutant SHIV162p3(M184V), followed by a  second dose 2 h after exposure. Five untreated animals were used as controls.  Virus exposures were done weekly for up to 14 weeks. Despite the high  (>100-fold) level of FTC resistance conferred by M184V, all five treated animals  were protected from infection, while the five untreated macaques were infected  (P = 0.0008). Our results show that Truvada maintains high prophylactic efficacy  against an FTC-resistant isolate. Increased susceptibility to tenofovir due to  M184V and other factors, including residual antiviral activity by FTC and/or  reduced virus fitness due to M184V, may all have contributed to the observed  protection.']]]",No,"[{'Exact': array([-0.34010781,  0.09066457, -0.23840934,  0.12988285,  0.39494209,

What is Hemophilic Pseudotumor?,"[[['Hemophilic pseudotumor is an uncommon complication seen in approximately 1-2% of  patients with severe hemophilia. Hemophilic pseudotumors are distinguished into  two subdivisions based on location, proximal or distal. Plain x-rays and CT are  useful in diagnosis, but MR imaging is the diagnostic test of choice because of  its sensitivity to the various blood products. The choice of therapy depends on  many parameters, such as the size of the tumor, the age of the patient, and the  relation with underlying organs. In most cases of asymptomatic hemophilic  pseudotumor, conservative treatment with administration of missing factor as  well as immobilization is recommended. The authors describe a 13-year-old boy  with severe hemophilia A, who presented with a tibial pseudotumor a few months  after an injury. He was conservatively treated for a long period, with daily  administration of recombinant factor VIII. His clinical condition improved  shortly after therapy induction, but radiological improvement has been moderate.  Case history, imaging findings, and therapeutic options are discussed.', 'Hemophilic pseudotumor is a rare, but well-known, complication of hemophilia  occurring in 1-2\xa0% of individuals with a severe factor VIII or IX deficiency.  The hemophilic pseudotumor is defined as an encapsulated hematoma that increases  of volume progressively by episodes of recurrent hemorrhage; usually originate  in soft tissues or in subperiosteal or intraosseous areas. Very seldom, patient  with mild form of hemophilia present with intraosseous pseudotumor. This report  describe an 11-year-old boy with mild factor IX deficiency (17\xa0% of normal  factor IX activity), who developed a pseudotumor of the femur.', ""OBJECTIVES/HYPOTHESIS: Hemophilic pseudotumors are rare clinical entities in  otolaryngology. An unusual case of a pediatric hemophilic pseudotumor of the  paranasal sinus in a previously undiagnosed hemophiliac is presented. STUDY DESIGN: Case report. METHODS: A 6-month-old, otherwise healthy boy was admitted for evaluation of a  rapidly expanding left-sided cheek mass. The patient's initial presentation,  imaging workup, and intraoperative and postoperative courses are discussed. RESULTS: Imaging workup revealed a large, heterogeneous, dense lesion in the  patient's left-side maxillary sinus with distortion of the orbital floor and  hard palate. Because of the concern for an aggressive malignancy, a biopsy was  performed. After a Caldwell-Luc approach, a large amount of greenish fluid  leaked from an otherwise empty maxillary sinus. The patient continued to bleed  from his intraoral incision postoperatively and required two packed erythrocyte  transfusions. Subsequent hematological testing led to a diagnosis of severe  hemophilia type A with factor VIII levels less than 1% of normal. After  treatment with recombinant coagulation factors hemostasis was achieved, and the  patient clinically improved. CONCLUSION: The study presents the first report of a pediatric hemophilic  pseudotumor in the paranasal sinuses leading to a diagnosis of hemophilia. It is  a rare entity characterized by a cycle of repeated hemorrhage with subsequent  encapsulation of the coagulum leading to pressure-induced distortion of adjacent  bone. In the correct clinical setting, hemophilic pseudotumor should be  considered in the differential diagnosis of a rapidly expanding mass in  children."", 'INTRODUCTION: Hemophilic pseudotumor is a rare complication that occurs in  patients with severe hemophilia. Results from multiple episodes of bleeding into  the bones and soft tissues. PRESENTATION OF CASE: A 31 years old male patient, with severe hemophilia A.  Diagnosed with an abdominal tumor 10 years ago during routine screening, that  progressively grew to encompass the entire abdominal area, with symptoms of  intestinal obstruction. DISCUSSION: Hemophilic pseudotumor appears as a painless tumor of slow growth  that can compress vital organs producing bone destruction, muscle and skin  necrosis. The tumor may have fistulas or break spontaneously. CONCLUSION: The abdominal hemophilic pseudotumor is a rare pathological entity,  with few reports worldwide, but must be considered in hemophilic patients with a  well documented abdominal tumor.', 'Hemophilic pseudotumor is a rare complication of hemophilia.

A total dose of  2000 cGy in 10 fractions was administered in 2 weeks. Factor VIII was not given.  After 4 months, complete healing was seen. The patient was followed up at 24  months, and there was no evidence of recurrence and no bone growth disturbance.

This report describes a  case of hemophilic pseudotumor of the maxillary alveolar ridge that occurred in  a boy with mild hemophilia A (14% factor VIII activity). The lesion, which  presented as an alveolar mucosal swelling, responded well to enucleation,  curettage, and intralesional fibrin glue injection.', 'BACKGROUND: Hemophilic pseudotumor is an unusual complication occurring in only  1% to 2% of patients with severe factor VIII or IX deficiency, and manifests as  a progressive enlargement of hematoma by recurrent hemorrhage, often resulting  in bone destruction or resorption due to the chronic pressure of osseous  hemorrhage. Cranial hemophilic pseudotumors are extremely rare, with only 4  previous cases associated with mild or moderate factor XIII deficiency. CASE DESCRIPTION: A 24-year-old man with moderate deficiency of factor IX  developed a cranial pseudotumor as a swelling in the frontal scalp. Blood  coagulation profile revealed extended activated partial thromboplastin time  (58.2 seconds). Factor IX analysis showed 3% of normal activity. Computed  tomography and magnetic resonance imaging demonstrated an extra-axial lesion  with bone destruction, enhanced rim, and signal changes consistent with chronic  hemorrhage. Surgical removal was performed. Histologic examination disclosed old  blood coagulum. CONCLUSIONS: This case of cranial hemophilic pseudotumor in a patient with  moderate factor IX deficiency suggests that cranial pseudotumor should be  considered in the differential diagnosis of cranial lesion in a patient with  hemophilia, and adequate replacement therapy in the perioperative period is  essential to achieve safe surgical removal.', 'OBJECTIVE AND IMPORTANCE: Hemophilic pseudotumor is a rare complication of  hemophilia, occurring in 1 to 2% of patients with severe hemophilia. Its  principal sites of occurrence are the long bones and the pelvis. Only one case  of this tumor occurring in the cranium has been previously reported. CLINICAL PRESENTATION: We report a case of cranial hemophilic pseudotumor  involving the diploe of the right parietal vault. A 29-year-old man with severe  hemophilia (Factor VIII, 0.8% of normal activity) presented with an unsightly  scalp protrusion measuring 5 x 5 x 2 cm and tingling discomfort in the left arm.  About 5 years before admission, he noted a walnut-sized, nontender mass in the  right parietal area that had enlarged slightly after minor head trauma. Tingling  discomfort developed as the manifestation of the compression of the parietal  lobe in the 2 to 3 months after the head trauma. INTERVENTION: Under proper factor replacement therapy, surgery was undertaken  for excision and tissue diagnosis. Histological examination of the content in  the diploe revealed old blood coagulum. CONCLUSION: Postoperatively, the tingling discomfort in the arm resolved  completely. To our knowledge, this is the second case of the cranial hemophilic  pseudotumor in the English literature. Diagnosis and management of cranial  hemophilic pseudotumor are presented with a review of the literature.', 'Hemophilic pseudotumor is a rare complication of hemophilia.

Hemophilic pseudotumor results  from multiple episodes of hemorrhage into bones or soft tissue spaces. It is  uncommon and is seen in severe cases of hemophilia only 1-2% of the time.  Complications and symptoms arise due to pain and/or compression of surrounding  structures. Pathologic fractures can be associated with intraosseous lesions and  can result from bone destruction or resorption due to the chronic pressure of an  osseous hemorrhage. Radiographs may demonstrate expansile lesions of the bones  or increased soft tissue density that may be associated with extra osseous  lesions. Bleeding may also occur within the joint space. These intra-articular  hemorrhages can, over time, result in hemophilic arthropathy. The following case  report demonstrates both an expansile lesion of a metacarpal as well as  hemophilic knee arthropathy in an 11 year old.']]]","Hemophilic pseudotumor is a rare complication of severe hemophilia, occurring in approximately 1-2% of patients.

What are the targets of avapritinib?,"[[['BACKGROUND: Whereas many new targets for drug discovery have been identified  from new biology, such as that from the Human Genome Project, some targets have  been known for decades but have not been exploited. OBJECTIVE: One such target, selective thyromimetics, is reviewed from a  historical perspective and in the light of recent developments. METHODS: The history of thyromimetics in atherosclerosis and dyslipidaemia is  reviewed as the background to the recent publication of the first human data on  a new selective thyromimetic, KB-2115 (eprotirome). CONCLUSION: The published data provide proof of concept/mechanism, opening the  way to larger studies in a wider range of subjects and in combination with  statins.', 'The concept of molecular tumor targeting might provide new hope in the treatment  of advanced prostate cancer. We evaluated metastasis blocking properties of the  histone deacetylase (HDAC) inhibitor valproic acid (VPA) and the mammalian  target of rapamycin (mTOR) inhibitor RAD001 on prostate cancer cell lines.  RAD001 or VPA were applied to PC-3 or LNCaP cells, either separately or in  combination. Adhesion to vascular endothelium or to immobilized collagen,  fibronectin or laminin was quantified. Migration and invasion were explored by a  modified Boyden chamber assay. Integrin α and β subtypes were analyzed by flow  cytometry, western blotting and RT-PCR. Effects of drug treatment on integrin  related signaling, Akt and p70S6kinase activation, histone H3 and H4 acetylation  were also determined. Separate application of RAD001 or VPA distinctly reduced  tumor cell adhesion, migration and invasion, accompanied by elevated Akt  activation and p70S6kinase de-activation. Integrin subtype expression was  altered significantly by both compounds (VPA > RAD001). When both drugs were  used in concert additive effects were observed on the migratory and invasive  behavior but not on tumor-endothelium and tumor-matrix interaction. Separate  mTOR or HDAC inhibition slows processes related to tumor metastasis. The  RAD001-VPA combination showed advantage over VPA monotreatment with particular  respect to migration and invasion. Ongoing studies are required to assess the  relevance of VPA monotherapy versus VPA-RAD001 combination on tumor cell  motility.', 'BACKGROUND: Most gastrointestinal stromal tumors (GIST) driven by KIT or  platelet-derived growth factor receptor A (PDGFRA) mutations develop resistance  to available tyrosine kinase inhibitor (TKI) treatments. NAVIGATOR is a  two-part, single-arm, dose escalation and expansion study designed to evaluate  safety and antineoplastic activity of avapritinib, a selective, potent inhibitor  of KIT and PDGFRA, in patients with unresectable or metastatic GIST. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Eligible patients were 18\u2009years or older with  histologically or cytologically confirmed unresectable GIST and Eastern  Cooperative Oncology Group performance status ≤2 and initiated avapritinib at  300 mg or 400 mg once daily. Primary endpoints were safety in patients who  initiated avapritinib at 300 mg or 400 mg once daily and overall response rate  (ORR) in patients in the safety population with three or more previous lines of  TKI therapy. RESULTS: As of November 16, 2018, in the safety population (n =\u2009204), the most  common adverse events (AEs) were nausea (131 [64%]), fatigue (113 [55%]), anemia  (102 [50%]), cognitive effects (84 [41%]), and periorbital edema (83 [41%]); 17  (8%) patients discontinued due to treatment-related AEs, most frequently  confusion, encephalopathy, and fatigue. ORR in response-evaluable patients with  GIST harboring KIT or non-D842V PDGFRA mutations and with at least three prior  therapies (n =\u2009103) was 17% (95% confidence interval [CI], 10-25). Median  duration of response was 10.2 months (95% CI, 7.2-10.2), and median  progression-free survival was 3.7 months (95% CI, 2.8-4.6). CONCLUSION: Avapritinib has manageable toxicity with meaningful clinical  activity as fourth-line or later treatment in some patients with GIST with KIT  or PDGFRA mutations. IMPLICATIONS FOR PRACTICE: In the NAVIGATOR trial, avapritinib, an inhibitor of  KIT and platelet-derived growth factor receptor A tyrosine kinases, provided  durable responses in a proportion of patients with advanced gastrointestinal  stromal tumors (GIST) who had received three or more prior therapies.  Avapritinib had a tolerable safety profile, with cognitive adverse events  manageable with dose interruptions and modification in most cases. These  findings indicate that avapritinib can elicit durable treatment responses in  some patients with heavily pretreated GIST, for whom limited treatment options  exist.', ""Author information: (1)Department of Medical Oncology, Sarcoma Center, West German Cancer Center,  University Duisburg-Essen, Medical School, Essen, Germany.

(#)Contributed equally"", 'INTRODUCTION: 90% of gastrointestinal stromal tumors (GISTs) harbor an  activating mutation in the KIT or PDGFRα oncogene, and these are known to confer  imatinib sensitivity. AREAS COVERED: The author reviews the data regarding the current management of  GIST, mechanisms of resistance to imatinib, and new drugs currently in clinical  development and provides his unique perspectives on the subject matter. EXPERT OPINION: Several studies have shown that the response to imatinib in GIST  patients mainly depends on the mutational status of KIT or PDGFRα. Moreover,  most, if not all, patients treated with imatinib for advanced GIST will develop  a secondary progressive disease under the treatment. In most cases, such  progressions are the result of acquired resistance due to the occurrence of  secondary c-KIT mutations, especially in GISTs with primary exon 11 mutations.  Sunitinib and regorafenib are inhibitors of multiple tyrosine kinases, including  KIT, PDGFRα, PDGFRβ, and VEGFRs, and are approved for the management of  imatinib- and imatinib/sunitinib-refractory GIST patients, respectively.  Clearly, better knowledge of the molecular mechanisms underlying the resistance  to imatinib as well as the development of a new class of broad-spectrum tyrosine  kinase inhibitors such as avapritinib and ripretinib will provide new  individualized therapeutic strategies for GIST patients.', 'Bruton tyrosine kinase (BTK) plays an important role in the B-cell receptor  (BCR) signaling pathway by mediating proliferation, migration and adhesion in  B-cell malignancies. Therefore, the components of BCR signaling, especially BTK,  are considered to be attractive therapeutic targets. Ibrutinib, a first-in-class  BTK inhibitor, has been approved for the treatment of several types of B-cell  malignancies worldwide. However, ibrutinib has off-target activities on non-BTK  kinase that are related to adverse effects or might translate into clinical  limitations. To overcome these limitations, more specific BTK inhibitors are  needed. Tirabrutinib hydrochloride (tirabrutinib) is a potent, highly selective,  irreversible oral inhibitor of BTK. Tirabrutinib irreversibly and covalently  binds to BTK in B cells and has demonstrated effective in vitro cytotoxicity in  many types of B-cell malignancies and in vivo antitumor activity in mouse  models. Here, we provide a comprehensive review of the preclinical and clinical  activity of tirabrutinib, a drug approved in Japan for relapsed or refractory  primary central nervous system lymphoma and all lines of Waldenström  macroglobulinemia/lymphoplasmacytic lymphoma.', 'In a phase I trial of avapritinib (formerly BLU-285), which targets D816V mutant  KIT, for the treatment of advanced systemic mastocytosis, patients experienced  rapid and durable disease control. The overall response rate was 72%, and 56% of  patients experienced a complete or partial response. No patients discontinued  treatment due to adverse events, most of which were mild to moderate in nature.', ""BACKGROUND: Targeting of KIT and PDGFRA with imatinib revolutionised treatment  in gastrointestinal stromal tumour; however, PDGFRA Asp842Val (D842V)-mutated  gastrointestinal stromal tumour is highly resistant to tyrosine kinase  inhibitors. We aimed to assess the safety, tolerability, and antitumour activity  of avapritinib, a novel KIT and PDGFRA inhibitor that potently inhibits PDGFRA  D842V, in patients with advanced gastrointestinal stromal tumours, including  patients with KIT and PDGFRA D842V-mutant gastrointestinal stromal tumours  (NAVIGATOR). METHODS: NAVIGATOR is a two-part, open-label, dose-escalation and  dose-expansion, phase 1 study done at 17 sites across nine countries (Belgium,  France, Germany, Poland, Netherlands, South Korea, Spain, the UK, and the USA).  Patients aged 18 years or older, with an Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group  performance status of 2 or less, and with adequate end-organ function were  eligible to participate. The dose-escalation part of the study included patients  with unresectable gastrointestinal stromal tumours. The dose-expansion part of  the study included patients with an unresectable PDGFRA D842V-mutant  gastrointestinal stromal tumour regardless of previous therapy or  gastrointestinal stromal tumour with other mutations that either progressed on  imatinib and one or more tyrosine kinase inhibitor, or only received imatinib  previously. On the basis of enrolment trends, ongoing review of study data, and  evolving knowledge regarding the gastrointestinal stromal tumour treatment  paradigm, it was decided by the sponsor's medical director together with the  investigators that patients with PDGFRA D842V mutations would be analysed  separately; the results from this group of patients is reported in this Article.  Oral avapritinib was administered once daily in the dose-escalation part  (starting dose of 30 mg, with increasing dose levels once daily in continuous  28-day cycles until the maximum tolerated dose or recommended phase 2 dose was  determined; in the dose-expansion part, the starting dose was the maximum  tolerated dose from the dose-escalation part). Primary endpoints were maximum  tolerated dose, recommended phase 2 dose, and safety in the dose-escalation  part, and overall response and safety in the dose-expansion part. Safety was  assessed in all patients from the dose-escalation part and all patients with  PDGFRA D842V-mutant gastrointestinal stromal tumour in the dose-expansion part,  and activity was assessed in all patients with PDGFRA D842V-mutant  gastrointestinal stromal tumour who received avapritinib and who had at least  one target lesion and at least one post-baseline disease assessment by central  radiology. This study is registered with ClinicalTrials.gov, NCT02508532. FINDINGS: Between Oct 26, 2015, and Nov 16, 2018 (data cutoff), 46 patients were  enrolled in the dose-escalation part, including 20 patients with a PDGFRA  D842V-mutant gastrointestinal stromal tumour, and 36 patients with a PDGFRA  D842V-mutant gastrointestinal stromal tumour were enrolled in the dose-expansion  part. At data cutoff (Nov 16, 2018), 38 (46%) of 82 patients in the safety  population (median follow-up of 19·1 months [IQR 9·2-25·5]) and 37 (66%) of the  56 patients in the PDGFRA D842V population (median follow-up of 15·9 months [IQR  9·2-24·9]) remained on treatment. The maximum tolerated dose was 400 mg, and the  recommended phase 2 dose was 300 mg. In the safety population (patients with  PDGFRA D842V-mutant gastrointestinal stromal tumour from the dose-escalation and  dose-expansion parts, all doses), treatment-related grade 3-4 events occurred in  47 (57%) of 82 patients, the most common being anaemia (14 [17%]); there were no  treatment-related deaths. In the PDGFRA D842V-mutant population, 49 (88%; 95% CI  76-95) of 56 patients had an overall response, with five (9%) complete responses  and 44 (79%) partial responses. No dose-limiting toxicities were observed at  doses of 30-400 mg per day. At 600 mg, two patients had dose-limiting toxicities  (grade 2 hypertension, dermatitis acneiform, and memory impairment in patient 1,  and grade 2 hyperbilirubinaemia in patient 2). INTERPRETATION: Avapritinib has a manageable safety profile and has preliminary  antitumour activity in patients with advanced PDGFRA D842V-mutant  gastrointestinal stromal tumours. FUNDING: Blueprint Medicines."", 'Deregulation of the cyclin-dependent kinase (CDK) 4/6-retinoblastoma (RB) axis  can occur through a number of mechanisms and contributes towards the  unrestrained growth witnessed in a variety of cancers including breast cancers.  Recent years have seen the development of selective CDK4/6 inhibitors, which  have delivered promising preclinical and clinical results in breast cancer and  other tumours. A number of trials assessing antitumour efficacy in various  disease settings and combinations are ongoing. The cyclin D1-CDK-Rb axis and its  role in the cell cycle of normal and cancer cells are delineated. The early  pan-CDK inhibitor flavopiridol and subsequent preclinical and clinical  development of selective CDK4/6 inhibitors are described. Ongoing studies in  breast cancer with novel CDK4/6 inhibitors (palbociclib, abemaciclib and  ribociclib) are explored. A literature search of these topics was performed  through PubMed. Abstracts from major oncology meetings were also reviewed.  Selective CDK4/6 inhibitors, as represented by the competing compounds currently  in clinical development, comprise a novel, safe and, thus far, promisingly  efficacious group of drugs. Considerable resources are being devoted towards  exploring the efficacy of these drugs in combination with endocrine therapies,  an approach that has yielded encouraging results and accelerated approval by the  US Food and Drugs Administration for one of these agents (palbociclib). The  results of confirmatory phase 3 trials are, however, awaited. We discuss further  therapy combinations in development and highlight potential areas for caution  including the potential for antagonistic interactions with cytotoxic  chemotherapies.', 'PURPOSE: Although histone deacetylase inhibitors (HDACi) are emerging as a new  class of anticancer agents, one of the most significant concerns is that  interactions with a wide array of substrates using these agents might initiate  both therapeutic and undesired protective responses. Here, we sought to identify  the potential protective reactions initiated by HDACi and determine whether  targeting these reactions would enhance the antitumoral activity of HDACi. EXPERIMENTAL DESIGN: Gene expression profiles were analyzed by cDNA microarray  in Molt-4 cells before and after treatment of vorinostat. Induction of CD146 by  vorinostat was examined in a wide range of tumors and nonmalignant cells. AA98,  an anti-CD146 monoclonal antibody, was used to target CD146 function.  Synergistic antitumoral and antiangiogenic effects between AA98 and vorinostat  were examined both in vitro and in vivo. The potential effect of combined AA98  and vorinostat treatment on the AKT pathway was determined by Western blotting. RESULTS: The induction of CD146 is a common phenomenon in vorinostat-treated  cancer but not in nonmalignant cells. Targeting of CD146 with AA98 substantially  enhanced vorinostat-induced killing via the suppression of activation of AKT  pathways in cancer cells. Moreover, AA98 in combination with vorinostat  significantly inhibited angiogenesis. In vivo, AA98 synergized with vorinostat  to inhibit tumor growth and metastasis. CONCLUSION: The present study provided the first evidence that an undesired  induction of CD146 could serve as a protective response to offset the antitumor  efficacy of vorinostat. On the other hand, targeting CD146 in combination with  vorinostat could be exploited as a novel strategy to more effectively kill  cancer cells.']]]","Avapritinib targets KIT and PDGFRA receptors.

Recent  studies have mainly been devoted to the function of the circular RNA sponge for  miR-7 (ciRS-7) and sex-determining region Y (SRY) by targeting microRNA-7  (miR-7) and microRNA-138 (miR-138), respectively. In this review, we illustrate  the specific role of circRNAs in a wide variety of cancers and in regulating the  biological behavior of cancers via miR-7 or miR-138 regulation. Furthermore,  circRNA, together with its gene silencing ability, also shows its potential in  RNA interference (RNAi) therapy by binding to target RNAs, which provides a  novel perspective in cancer treatment. Thus, this review concerns the  biogenesis, biological function, oncogenesis, progression and possible therapies  for cancer involving circRNAs.', ""Circular RNAs (circRNAs) are important for the development and regeneration of  the nervous system. We investigated the differential expression profiles of  circRNA induced by spinal cord injury and reported that circRNA_01477  facilitates spinal astrocyte proliferation and migration after injury in rats.  In this study, we further clarified the function and possible mechanism of  action of circRNA_01477 in neurons. Fluorescence in situ hybridization assay  revealed that circRNA_01477 is mainly localized in the neuronal cytoplasm.  Knockdown of circRNA_01477 significantly increased axonal length. The  circRNA_01477/microRNAs (miRNA)/messenger RNA (mRNA) interaction network was  investigated using RNA sequencing. miRNA-3075 showed a remarkable increase after  circRNA_01477 depletion, and either overexpression of miRNA-3075 or  downregulation of its target gene FosB significantly promoted axonal growth.  Luciferase reporter assay showed that miRNA-3075 could directly bind to the  3'UTR of FosB and negatively regulated FosB transcription. Dual silencing of  circRNA_01477 and miR-3075 revealed that miR-3075 inhibition rescued the  increased axon length caused by siCircRNA_01477. Finally, we verified that the  Stat3 pathway was activated after FosB protein depletion in rat spinal neurons,  while the NF-κB pathway was not altered. In summary, our study is the first to  report that circRNA_01477 contributes to axon growth by functioning as miRNA  sponge by regulating the miRNA-3075/FosB/Stat3 axis."", ""Circular RNAs (circRNAs) are a class of non‑coding RNAs formed by covalently  closed loops through back‑splicing and exon‑skipping. circRNAs have been  confirmed to play a vital role in various biological functions, acting as  microRNA sponges and reservoirs, as well as combining with RNA‑binding proteins  during the progression of multiple cancer types. Therefore, the present review  evaluated recent research articles in PubMed that were published between  November\xa02017 and September\xa02020. Key word search strings included: 'Circular  RNA (circRNA) AND bladder cancer\xa0(BC)', 'circular RNA (circRNA) AND prostate  cancer\xa0(PCa)' and 'circular RNA (circRNA) AND renal cell cancer\xa0(RCC)'. In  total, >58\xa0circRNAs were found to be implicated in urological cancers, with  several of the circRNAs targeting common carcinogenic pathways, such as the AKT,  TGF‑β, MAPK, VEGF and even metabolic pathways. circRNAs are important modulators  of BC, PCa and RCC. circRNAs are functionally implicated in the pathogenesis of  these cancer types, and have been found to act as biomarkers for the diagnosis  and prognosis of urological cancer. However, to the best of our knowledge, the  functions of circRNAs in tumors of the urinary system remain largely unknown and  require further research."", ""Circular RNAs (circRNAs) are a novel type of universal and diverse endogenous  noncoding RNAs (ncRNAs) and they form a covalently closed continuous loop  without 5' or 3' tails unlike linear RNAs. Most circRNAs are presented with  characteristics of abundance, stability, conservatism, and often exhibiting  tissue/developmental-stage-specific expression. CircRNAs are generated either  from exons or introns by back splicing or lariat introns. CircRNAs play  important roles as miRNA sponges, gene transcription and expression regulators,  RNA-binding protein (RBP) sponges and protein/peptide translators. Emerging  evidence revealed the function of circRNAs in cancer and may potentially serve  as a required novel biomarker and therapeutic target for cancer treatment. In  this review, we discuss about the origins, characteristics and functions of  circRNA and how they work as miRNA sponges, gene transcription and expression  regulators, RBP sponges in cancer as well as current research methods of  circRNAs, providing evidence for the significance of circRNAs in cancer  diagnosis and clinical treatment."", ""Circular RNAs (circRNAs) belong to a recently re-discovered species of RNA that  emerge during RNA maturation through a process called back-splicing. A  downstream 5' splice site is linked to an upstream 3' splice site to form a  circular transcript instead of a canonical linear transcript. Recent advances in  next-generation sequencing (NGS) have brought circRNAs back into the focus of  many scientists. Since then, several studies reported that circRNAs are  differentially expressed across tissue types and developmental stages, implying  that they are actively regulated and not merely a by-product of splicing. Though  functional studies have shown that some circRNAs could act as miRNA-sponges, the  function of most circRNAs remains unknown. To expand our understanding of  possible roles of circular RNAs, we propose a new pipeline that could fully  characterizes candidate circRNA structure from RNAseq data-FUCHS: FUll  CHaracterization of circular RNA using RNA-Sequencing. Currently, most  computational prediction pipelines use back-spliced reads to identify circular  RNAs. FUCHS extends this concept by considering all RNA-seq information from  long reads (typically >150 bp) to learn more about the exon coverage, the number  of double break point fragments, the different circular isoforms arising from  one host-gene, and the alternatively spliced exons within the same circRNA  boundaries. This new knowledge will enable the user to carry out differential  motif enrichment and miRNA seed analysis to determine potential regulators  during circRNA biogenesis. FUCHS is an easy-to-use Python based pipeline that  contributes a new aspect to the circRNA research."", 'AIMS: Circular RNA (circRNA) is a newly validated class of single-stranded RNA,  ubiquitously expressed in mammalian tissues and possessing key functions  including acting as microRNA sponges and as transcriptional regulators by  binding to RNA-binding proteins. While independent studies confirm the  expression of circRNA in various tissue types, genome-wide circRNA expression in  the heart has yet to be described in detail. METHODS AND RESULTS: We performed deep RNA-sequencing on ribosomal-depleted RNA  isolated from 12 human hearts, 25 mouse hearts and across a 28-day  differentiation time-course of human embryonic stem cell-derived cardiomyocytes.  Using purpose-designed bioinformatics tools, we uncovered a total of 15\u2009318 and  3017 cardiac circRNA within human and mouse, respectively. Their abundance  generally correlates with the abundance of their cognate linear RNA, but  selected circRNAs exist at disproportionately higher abundance. Top highly  expressed circRNA corresponded to key cardiac genes including Titin (TTN), RYR2,  and DMD. The most abundant cardiac-expressed circRNA is a cytoplasmic localized  single-exon circSLC8A1-1. The longest human transcript TTN alone generates up to  415 different exonic circRNA isoforms, the majority (83%) of which originates  from the I-band domain. Finally, we confirmed the expression of selected cardiac  circRNA by RT-PCR, Sanger sequencing and single molecule RNA-fluorescence in  situ hybridization. CONCLUSIONS: Our data provide a detailed circRNA expression landscape in hearts.  There is a high-abundance of specific cardiac-expressed circRNA. These findings  open up a new avenue for future investigation into this emerging class of RNA.', 'Author information: (1)College of Bioinformatics Science and Technology, Harbin Medical University,  Harbin 150081, China. bioccwsy@gmail.com.

CircRNAs are generated in the process of back-splicing and can originate  from different genomic regions. Their unique circular structure makes circRNAs  more stable than linear RNAs. In addition, they also display insensitivity to  ribonuclease activity. Generally, circRNAs function as microRNA (miRNA) sponges  and have a regulatory role in transcription and translation. They may be also  translated in a cap-independent manner in vivo, to generate specific proteins.  In the last decade, next-generation sequencing techniques, especially RNA-seq,  have revealed great abundance and also dysregulation of many circRNAs in various  diseases, suggesting their involvement in disease development and progression.  Regarding their high stability and relatively specific differential expression  patterns in tissues and extracellular environment (e.g., body fluids), they are  regarded as promising novel biomarkers in cancer.

Where is X-ray free electron laser used?,"[[['The short and intense pulses of the new X-ray free electron lasers, now  operational or under construction, may make possible diffraction experiments on  single molecule-sized objects with high resolution, before radiation damage  destroys the sample. In a single molecule imaging (SMI) experiment thousands of  diffraction patterns of single molecules with random orientations are recorded.  One of the most challenging problems of SMI is how to assemble these noisy  patterns of unknown orientations into a consistent single set of diffraction  data. Here we present a new method which can solve the orientation problem of  SMI efficiently even for large biological molecules and in the presence of  noise. We show on simulated diffraction patterns of a large protein molecule,  how the orientations of the patterns can be found and the structure to atomic  resolution can be solved. The concept of our algorithm could be also applied to  experiments where images of an object are recorded in unknown orientations  and/or positions like in cryoEM or tomography.', 'The multiwavelength anomalous diffraction (MAD) method is used to determine  phase information in x-ray crystallography by employing anomalous scattering  from heavy atoms. X-ray free-electron lasers (FELs) show promise for revealing  the structure of single molecules or nanocrystals, but the phase problem remains  largely unsolved. Because of the ultrabrightness of x-ray FEL, samples  experience severe electronic radiation damage, especially to heavy atoms, which  hinders direct implementation of MAD with x-ray FELs. Here, we propose a  generalized version of MAD phasing at high x-ray intensity. We demonstrate the  existence of a Karle-Hendrickson-type equation in the high-intensity regime and  calculate relevant coefficients with detailed electronic damage dynamics of  heavy atoms. The present method offers a potential for ab initio structural  determination in femtosecond x-ray nanocrystallography.', 'The recent development of x-ray free electron lasers providing coherent,  femtosecond-long pulses of high brilliance and variable energy opens new areas  of scientific research in a variety of disciplines such as physics, chemistry,  and biology. Pump-probe experimental techniques which observe the temporal  evolution of systems after optical or x-ray pulse excitation are one of the main  experimental schemes currently in use for ultrafast studies. The key challenge  in these experiments is to reliably achieve temporal and spatial overlap of the  x-ray and optical pulses. Here we present measurements of the x-ray pulse  induced transient change of optical reflectivity from a variety of materials  covering the soft x-ray photon energy range from 500eV to 2000eV and outline the  use of this technique to establish and characterize temporal synchronization of  the optical-laser and FEL x-ray pulses.', 'X-ray free-electron lasers (XFELs) generate sequences of ultra-short spatially  coherent pulses of X-ray radiation. A diffraction focusing spectrometer (DFS),  which is able to measure the whole energy spectrum of the radiation of a single  XFEL pulse with an energy resolution of ΔE/E 2 × 10(-6), is proposed. This is  much better than for most modern X-ray spectrometers. Such resolution allows one  to resolve the fine spectral structure of the XFEL pulse. The effect of  diffraction focusing occurs in a single-crystal plate due to dynamical  scattering, and is similar to focusing in a Pendry lens made from a metamaterial  with a negative refraction index. Such a spectrometer is easier to operate than  those based on bent crystals. It is shown that the DFS can be used in a wide  energy range from 5 keV to 20 keV.', 'Coherent x-ray diffraction microscopy is a method of imaging nonperiodic  isolated objects at resolutions limited, in principle, by only the wavelength  and largest scattering angles recorded. We demonstrate x-ray diffraction imaging  with high resolution in all three dimensions, as determined by a quantitative  analysis of the reconstructed volume images. These images are retrieved from the  three-dimensional diffraction data using no a priori knowledge about the shape  or composition of the object, which has never before been demonstrated on a  nonperiodic object. We also construct two-dimensional images of thick objects  with greatly increased depth of focus (without loss of transverse spatial  resolution). These methods can be used to image biological and materials science  samples at high resolution with x-ray undulator radiation and establishes the  techniques to be used in atomic-resolution ultrafast imaging at x-ray  free-electron laser sources.', 'We demonstrate the use of an X-ray free electron laser synchronized with an  optical pump laser to obtain X-ray diffraction snapshots from the photoactivated  states of large membrane protein complexes in the form of nanocrystals flowing  in a liquid jet. Light-induced changes of Photosystem I-Ferredoxin co-crystals  were observed at time delays of 5 to 10 µs after excitation. The result  correlates with the microsecond kinetics of electron transfer from Photosystem I  to ferredoxin. The undocking process that follows the electron transfer leads to  large rearrangements in the crystals that will terminally lead to the  disintegration of the crystals. We describe the experimental setup and obtain  the first time-resolved femtosecond serial X-ray crystallography results from an  irreversible photo-chemical reaction at the Linac Coherent Light Source. This  technique opens the door to time-resolved structural studies of reaction  dynamics in biological systems.', 'The emergence of femtosecond diffractive imaging with X-ray lasers has enabled  pioneering structural studies of isolated particles, such as viruses, at  nanometer length scales. However, the issue of missing low frequency data  significantly limits the potential of X-ray lasers to reveal sub-nanometer  details of micrometer-sized samples. We have developed a new technique of  dark-field coherent diffractive imaging to simultaneously overcome the missing  data issue and enable us to harness the unique contrast mechanisms available in  dark-field microscopy. Images of airborne particulate matter (soot) up to two  microns in length were obtained using single-shot diffraction patterns obtained  at the Linac Coherent Light Source, four times the size of objects previously  imaged in similar experiments. This technique opens the door to femtosecond  diffractive imaging of a wide range of micrometer-sized materials that exhibit  irreproducible complexity down to the nanoscale, including airborne particulate  matter, small cells, bacteria and gold-labeled biological samples.', 'A multi-crystal wavelength dispersive hard x-ray spectrometer with high-energy  resolution and large solid angle collection is described. The instrument is  specifically designed for time-resolved applications of x-ray emission  spectroscopy (XES) and x-ray Raman scattering (XRS) at X-ray Free Electron  Lasers (XFEL) and synchrotron radiation facilities. It also simplifies resonant  inelastic x-ray scattering (RIXS) studies of the whole 2d RIXS plane. The  spectrometer is based on the Von Hamos geometry. This dispersive setup enables  an XES or XRS spectrum to be measured in a single-shot mode, overcoming the  scanning needs of the Rowland circle spectrometers. In conjunction with the XFEL  temporal profile and high-flux, it is a powerful tool for studying the dynamics  of time-dependent systems. Photo-induced processes and fast catalytic reaction  kinetics, ranging from femtoseconds to milliseconds, will be resolvable in a  wide array of systems circumventing radiation damage.', 'Coherent diffraction imaging (CDI) of single molecules at atomic resolution is a  major goal for the x-ray free-electron lasers (XFELs). However, during an  imaging pulse, the fast laser-induced ionization may strongly affect the  recorded diffraction pattern of the irradiated sample. The radiation tolerance  of the imaged molecule should then be investigated a priori with a dedicated  simulation tool. The continuum approach is a powerful tool for modeling the  evolution of irradiated large systems consisting of more than a few hundred  thousand atoms. However, this method follows the evolution of average  single-particle densities, and the experimentally recorded intensities reflect  the spatial two-particle correlations. The information on these correlations is  then inherently not accessible within the continuum approach. In this paper we  analyze this limitation of continuum models and discuss the applicability of  continuum models for imaging studies. We derive a formula to calculate scattered  intensities (including both elastic and inelastic scattering) from the estimates  obtained with a single-particle continuum model under conditions typical for CDI  studies with XFELs. We demonstrate through numerical simulations that it  describes the scattered signal with good accuracy. Two-particle correlation  effects manifest themselves only in the region of low momentum transfers,  together with the effects of the finite size of the sample. We also show that  inelastic scattering on bound electrons can have a significant impact on the  measured intensities: it contributes to the background that reduces the contrast  of the recorded image. This effect is even more pronounced at larger momentum  transfers. Therefore, whereas inelastic scattering can be neglected for  nanocrystals, where Bragg scattering dominates, and in experiments imaging  single objects at low resolution, it should be taken into account when planning  atomic resolution imaging of nonperiodic samples. Finally, we show the effect of  the electronic damage on the recorded total signal. Progressing damage does not  change the positions of intensity peaks that correspond to the (fixed) positions  of imaged ions. It only changes the contrast between intensity minima and  maxima, which reduces the image contrast. Our results have implications for  imaging-oriented studies of radiation damage performed with continuum models, as  they define the limits of applicability of these models for CDI simulations.', 'The short and intense pulses of the new X-ray free electron lasers, now  operational or under construction, may make possible diffraction experiments on  single molecule-sized objects with high resolution, before radiation damage  destroys the sample.

What is holoprosencephaly?,"[[['Five cases are presented to demonstrate the computed tomographic (CT) spectrum  of holoprosencephaly. The classifications of alobar, semilobar, and lobar types  A and B holoprosencephaly are each represented, with an additional case of  semilobar holoprosencephaly complicated by a subdural effusion.', 'Ethmocephaly is the rarest form of holoprosencephaly, which occurs due to an  incomplete cleavage of the forebrain. Clinically, the disease presents with a  proboscis, hypotelorism, microphthalmos and malformed ears. Amniotic band  syndrome is another rare congenital malformation with ring-like constriction  bands in the limbs, head, face or trunk. We present a case of ethmocephaly with  amniotic band syndrome, which is likely the first of its kind, published in the  literature.', 'Agnathia, holoprosencephaly and situs inversus complex is an extremely rare form  of congenital malformation. Though a few cases have been reported from other  parts of the world, to the best of our knowledge none has been reported from  India so far. Maternal alcoholism is regarded as an important factor causing  holoprosencephaly. Disruption of the Shh gene signaling pathway is also said to  be a factor for the occurrence of holoprosencephaly as well as left right  asymmetry. Though several factors are suspected as a cause of this deformity,  the precise aetiopathogenesis is still under debate. Lack of knowledge might be  due to paucity of data from cases due to its rarity. Hereby, we are presenting a  case of agnathia, holoprosencephaly and situs inversus born at 32 wk of  gestation by an alcoholic mother. Externally the child had agnathia and  cyclopia. There was no mandible or any oral cavity. It was accompanied by  noticeable limb deformity. Internally there was holoprosencephaly, situs  inversus totalis with several visceral abnormalities. To the best of our  knowledge this is the first case of agnathia, holoprosencephaly and situs  inversus complex to be reported in an indexed literature from India. This report  also strengthens the association of maternal alcoholism with occurrence of  holoprosencephaly.', 'Structural malformations of the brain are an important cause of childhood  mortality and morbidity, with the latter having long-term financial and  psychosocial implications for the affected child and family. Holoprosencephaly  (HPE) is a severe brain malformation characterized by abnormal cleavage of the  prosencephalon in the 5th gestational week. Aprosencephaly and atelencephaly  occur earlier because of failure in the formation of the prosencephalon and  telencephalon, respectively. The HPE holoprosencephaly spectrum classically  includes alobar, semilobar, and lobar forms, although there are no clear-cut  defining features. The middle interhemispheric variant (MIH), also known as  syntelencephaly, is classified as a variant of HPE holoprosencephaly with  midline interhemispheric fusion. Other conditions sometimes included in the  spectrum of HPE holoprosencephaly include septo-optic dysplasia (SOD); ""minimal""  HPE holoprosencephaly , which is associated with subtle craniofacial  malformations and mild developmental delay; and microform HPE holoprosencephaly  , which by definition excludes brain involvement. The focus of this article will  be on the spectrum of findings visible in fetal manifestation of the HPE  holoprosencephaly spectrum. Brain embryology; the imaging characteristics,  epidemiology, and embryology of HPE; and the more common associated anomalies,  particularly those of the face (""the face predicts the brain"") are reviewed.  Recognition of these anomalies is important for accurate parental counseling,  since the prognosis is poor but not invariably lethal; children with the milder  forms may live well into their teens with severe developmental delays, endocrine  dysfunction, and disrupted homeostasis. Available data on outcome in surviving  children are summarized. Illustrative fetal ultrasonographic and magnetic  resonance images are presented with clinical, autopsy, and postnatal imaging  correlation.', 'BACKGROUND: Holoprosencephaly is a structural anomaly of the brain that consists  in a defect of the prosencephalon development that leads to face and  neurological defects of variable intensity. AIM: To estimate holoprosencephaly prevalence at birth. PATIENTS AND METHODS: All cases of holoprosencephaly, born alive or stillbirths,  registered in the 15 Chilean Hospitals of the Latin American Collaborative Study  of Congenital Malformations (ECLAMC) between 1972 and 2012, were studied.  Craniofacial and other anomalies found in newborns affected by holoprosencephaly  are described. RESULTS: Fifty five cases of holoprosencephaly (58% males) were found among the  798.222 registered births (rendering a prevalence at birth of 0.69 per 10.000  newborns). The most common cranial defect was medial cleft lip with cleft palate  (27.3%), bilateral cleft lip (11%) or both (38.2%), cyclopia (14%), single  nostril (10.9%) and proboscis (9.1%). Eleven percent cases had a trisomy 13. A  slight increase in prevalence over time was observed. CONCLUSIONS: Holoprosencephaly has a low frequency in Chile and is associated to  trisomy 13. The increase in prevalence could be explained by a better prenatal  diagnosis (ultrasonography).', 'Holoprosencephaly is a brain malformation that develops as a result of a defect  in development of prosencephalon during early gestation. Holoprosencephaly can  be diagnosed with prenatal ultrasonography and magnetic resonance imaging. We  report herein a case with cyclopia and holoprosencephaly detected by prenatal  ultrasonography.', 'Holoprosencephaly is a brain anomaly of varying severity with associated  extracranial, symptomatic abnormalities in only a minority of cases. The class  of brain defects known as holoprosencephaly represents a continuum usually  divided into three types: alobar, semilobar, and lobar. Each has both  distinctive radiological characteristics and some similarities. Typical facial  anomalies are found in the severe forms. Absent septum pellucidum and  septo-optic dysplasia, possibly of similar embryological origin, have some  resemblances to lobar holoprosencephaly, but are clinically and radiologically  separate in most instances. Agenesis of the corpus callosum, which is  superficially like holoprosencephaly, should not be confused with the  prosencephalic defects.', 'Cebocephaly is a very rare congenital anomaly combining a severe midline facial  malformation and holoprosencephaly. Here we report on first case of cebocephaly  with semilobar holoprosencephaly, hypotelorism, and a single nostril due to  intrauterine TORCH infection (Toxoplasmosis, other [syphilis, varicella-zoster,  parvovirus B19], Rubella, Cytomegalovirus [CMV], and Herpes infections) in the  English language literature. Chromosomal analysis showed normal karyotyping.', 'Holoprosencephaly (HPE) is the most common developmental defect of the forebrain  characterized by inadequate or absent midline division of the forebrain into  cerebral hemispheres, with concomitant midline facial defects in the majority of  cases. Understanding the pathogenesis of HPE requires knowledge of the  relationship between the developing brain and the facial structures during  embryogenesis. A number of signaling pathways control and coordinate the  development of the brain and face, including Sonic hedgehog, Bone morphogenetic  protein, Fibroblast growth factor, and Nodal signaling. Mutations in these  pathways have been identified in animal models of HPE and human patients.  Because of incomplete penetrance and variable expressivity of HPE, patients  carrying defined mutations may not manifest the disease at all, or have a  spectrum of defects. It is currently unknown what drives manifestation of HPE in  genetically at-risk individuals, but it has been speculated that other gene  mutations and environmental factors may combine as cumulative insults. HPE can  be diagnosed in utero by a high-resolution prenatal ultrasound or a fetal  magnetic resonance imaging, sometimes in combination with molecular testing from  chorionic villi or amniotic fluid sampling. Currently, there are no effective  preventive methods for HPE. Better understanding of the mechanisms of  gene-environment interactions in HPE would provide avenues for such  interventions.', 'Recent advances in genetics and neuroimaging have greatly contributed to our  understanding of the spectrum of midline brain and craniofacial malformations  known as holoprosencephaly. Neuroradiologic studies have provided detailed  characteristics of four major types of holoprosencephaly: alobar, semilobar,  lobar, and middle interhemispheric variant. Clinical studies in children with  these types of holoprosencephaly have revealed a wide range of survival and  neurologic outcomes. Motor and developmental dysfunctions correlate with the  severity of the brain malformation in holoprosencephaly. These findings have  implications in the management of medical problems associated with  holoprosencephaly and overall prognostication.']]]","Holoprosencephaly is a brain malformation characterized by an incomplete division of the forebrain into two cerebral hemispheres during early fetal development.

It falls within a spectrum of disorders that include alobar, semilobar, and lobar types, each with distinct imaging characteristics and potential associated anomalies. Holoprosencephaly often co-occurs with other congenital malformations and can lead to significant health issues if not managed appropriately.","[{'Exact': array([ 9.44334236,  2.80633137, -0.03677005, 29.11840382,  4.79391737,

What is Pseudomelanosis duodeni?,"[[['Melanosis of the stomach and duodenum is a rare entity and a striking finding  diagnosed by upper gastrointestinal endoscopy. Here, we describe the case of an  83-year-old female, with a complicated medical history, who was referred to  gastroenterologist to assess bleeding risk. From the endoscopy, it was  determined that she had both melanosis gastri and duodeni. Although both are  rare, gastric melanosis appears to be even more unusual than duodenal melanosis,  with only a few reported cases documented in the literature thus far.', 'Pseudomelanosis duodeni is an uncommon endoscopic sign characterized by diffuse  small black spots on the first and second portions of the duodenum. It occurs  predominantly in female and elderly patients and is linked to chronic illnesses  and related medications. Between 1988 and 1994, the authors saw eight patients  with pseudomelanosis duodeni. To evaluate the nature of the pigments, special  staining was performed in seven cases. Iron stain was strongly positive in three  cases. Electron microscopy was performed in two cases. This revealed amorphous  bodies within macrophage lysosomes in one case and angular crystals in another  case. These tests suggest that in pseudomelanosis duodeni iron metabolism may be  impaired and iron is pooled within macrophages.', 'The study of vertebrate pigmentary anomalies has greatly improved our  understanding of melanocyte biology. One such disorder, Waardenburg syndrome  (WS), is a mendelian trait characterized by hypopigmentation and sensorineural  deafness. It is commonly subdivided into four types (WS1-4), defined by the  presence or absence of additional symptoms. WS type 4 (WS4), or Shah-Waardenburg  syndrome, is also known as Hirschsprung disease Type II (HSCR II) and is  characterized by an absence of epidermal melanocytes and enteric ganglia.  Mutations in the genes encoding the endothelin type-B receptor (EDNRB) and its  physiological ligand endothelin 3 (EDN3) are now known to account for the  majority of HSCR II patients. Null mutations in the mouse genes Ednrb and Edn3  have identified a key role for this pathway in the normal development of  melanocytes and other neural crest-derived lineages. The pleiotropic effects of  genes in this pathway, on melanocyte and enteric neuron development, have been  clarified by the embryologic identification of their common neural crest (NC)  ancestry. EDNRB and EDN3 are transiently expressed in crest-derived melanoblast  and neuroblast precursors, and in the surrounding mesenchymal cells,  respectively. The influence of EDNRB-mediated signaling on the emigration,  migration, proliferation, and differentiation of melanocyte and enteric neuron  precursors, in vivo and in vitro has recently been the subject of great  scrutiny. A major emergent theme is that EDN3-induced signaling prevents the  premature differentiation of melanocyte and enteric nervous system precursors  and is essential between 10 and 12.5 days post-coitum. We review the present  understanding of pigment cell development in the context of EDNRB/EDN3--a  receptor-mediated pathway with pleiotropic effects.', ""Hirschsprung's disease is an inherited disorder characterized by the absence of  ganglion cells in the distal bowel.

This male baby  had congenital hydrocephalus, large and multiple pigmented skin nevi, and severe  abdominal distension. He showed marked hydrocephalus at birth and underwent a  ventriculo-peritoneal shunt at the age of 5 days. Investigations for gut  motility disorders revealed typical findings consistent with Hirschsprung's  disease involving the rectosigmoid colon. He was surgically treated for  Hirschsprung's disease after transanal endorectal pull-through at the age of 7  months. After settlement of the ventriculo-peritoneal shunt, the transanal  approach was of significant value for keeping the intraperitoneal catheter  clean. The association of developmental disorders of melanocytes and enteric  ganglia, both of which originated from the neural crest, suggested the presence  of mutual pathogenetic factors in the patient."", ""A 76-year-old female patient with a past medical history of diabetes mellitus,  stage 3 chronic renal failure and iron deficiency anemia was referred for  esophagogastroduodenoscopy (EGD) for evaluation of solid food dysphagia.

Basing on the  literature review only 3 similar cases were described in the world practice. The  boy with protein-losing enteropathy was examined at Moscow Scientific Centre of  Children's Health. The child had vomiting, diarrhea, loss in body weight,  hypoproteinemia, lymphopenia. The infectious nature of the disease was excluded.  It had been suggested the Waldman desease (primary intestinal lymphangiectasia).  The prognosis for such disease is unfavorable. An examination of the child was  continued against the backdrop of ongoing symptomatic therapy. Complete physical  examination included monitoring laboratory blood tests, X-ray examination with  contrast, CT-scan, gastroduodenoscopy with biopsy of the mucosa of the small  intestine. Malrotation duodenum with the recurrent mid-gut volvulus with the  development of secondary intestinal lymphangiectasia was diagnosed. Modern  methods of examination and multidisciplinary approach made it possible to  diagnose the case. Operation to eliminate fixation duodenum resulted in the  recovery of the patient. At the present time the child grows and develops  according to age and does not require treatment. The prognosis for this disease  is regarded as favorable."", ""Duodenal pseudomelanosis (or pseudomelanosis duodeni) is a rare benign condition  characterized by black-brown speckled pigmentation of the duodenal mucosa.  Collections of pigment-laden macrophages are found in the tips of duodenal  villi. The pigment is thought to be mostly composed of ferrous sulfide.  Histochemichal stains for iron (Perl's prussian blue) or melanin  (Masson-Fontana) may be positive, but are usually negative or unpredictable.  Duodenal pseudomelanosis occurs predominantly in middle-aged to old adults and  more commonly in females. It is associated with chronic renal failure, arterial  hypertension, diabetes mellitus and gastrointestinal bleeding. Medications such  as ferrous sulfate, hydralazine, propranolol, hydrochlorothiazide and furosemide  are thought to play a role as well. We report a case of a 86-year-old female who  presented with a history of watery diarrhea and melena. The patient had a  history of high blood pressure and ischemic stroke episodes. She was on multiple  medication including hidralazine, captopril, hydrochlorthiazide and aspirin. She  was dehydrated, her blood pressure was 96 × 60 mmHg and neurologic examination  showed complete left hemiplegia with central VII nerve palsy. Laboratory tests  showed normal serum electrolytes and renal function. Hemoglobin level was 10.7  g%. An upper endoscopy showed multiple diminutive black spots throughout the  distal duodenal bulb and second portion. Histology showed multiple foci of a  brown-black granular pigment inside macrophages within the tips of the villi  (pseudomelanosis). Stains for iron and melanin were negative. She was treated  with omeprazol, parenteral fluid replacement with saline and partial fasting.  After complete recovery she was discharged for ambulatory follow up.""]]]","Pseudomelanosis duodeni is a rare condition characterized by the accumulation of dark pigment in macrophages within the lamina propria of the duodenal mucosa. It typically presents as diffuse, small black spots on the first and second portions of the duodenum. This condition is often seen in elderly women, particularly those with chronic illnesses like diabetes, hypertension, and chronic renal failure. The pigment is primarily composed of ferrous sulfide. While the exact cause is unknown, it is believed to involve the absorption and storage of iron by macrophages. Histochemical stains for iron or melanin are usually negative or unpredictable in this condition.","[{'Exact': array([ 3.24817881, 27.03978404, -4.20478925, -8.03080687,  4.17918834,

What is the multisystem inflammatory syndrome in children (MIS-C) associated with COVID-19?,"[[['BACKGROUND. A multisystem inflammatory syndrome in children (MIS-C) associated  with coronavirus disease (COVID-19) has recently been described. OBJECTIVE. The  purpose of our study was to evaluate the imaging findings of MIS-C associated  with COVID-19. METHODS. Imaging studies and medical records of patients (age  range, 0-20 years) admitted with MIS-C between April 22 and May 21, 2020, were  retrospectively reviewed. Thoracic imaging studies were evaluated for  parenchymal, mediastinal and hilar, and cardiovascular abnormalities. Abdominal  imaging studies were evaluated for abnormalities of solid viscera, hollow  viscera, and the peritoneum as well as the mesentery and retroperitoneum.  Studies were reviewed independently by two radiologists, and disagreements were  resolved by a third senior radiologist. RESULTS. Sixteen patients (10 male and  six female patients; age range, 20 months-20 years) were included in this study.  All 16 patients presented with fever. Other presenting signs and symptoms  included the following: vomiting (12/16, 75%), abdominal pain (11/16, 69%), rash  (10/16, 63%), conjunctivitis (8/16, 50%), diarrhea (7/16, 44%), headache (6/16,  38%), and sore throat (5/16, 31%). Shortness of breath and cough were each  present in one patient. Chest radiography showed cardiomegaly (10/16, 63%),  congestive heart failure or cardiogenic pulmonary edema (9/16, 56%), atelectasis  (9/16, 56%), pleural effusions (7/16, 44%), acute respiratory distress syndrome  (2/16, 13%), and pneumonia (1/16, 6%). Eight patients (50%) were evaluated for  pulmonary embolism (PE) (six [75%] by CT angiography [CTA] and two [25%] by  ventilation-perfusion scintigraphy). In two of the eight patients (25%), CTA  showed a segmental PE. Abdominal imaging findings (ultrasound, CT, and  radiography) included small-volume ascites (6/16, 38%), hepatomegaly (6/16,  38%), echogenic kidneys (5/16, 31%), bowel wall thickening (3/16, 19%),  gallbladder wall thickening (3/16, 19%), mesenteric lymphadenopathy (2/16, 13%),  splenomegaly (1/16, 6%), and bladder wall thickening (1/16, 6%). The frequencies  of findings based on all the reviewed modalities were as follows: cardiomegaly  (12/16, 75%), pleural effusion (10/16, 63%), and atelectasis (10/16, 63%).  Absolute interobserver agreement was 0.69-1 for thoracic findings and 0.17-1 for  abdominal findings. Fifteen patients (94%) were discharged from the hospital  (length of hospital stay: range, 3-20 days), and one patient remained in the  hospital at the end of the study period. There were no mortalities. CONCLUSION.  MIS-C associated with COVID-19 is characterized predominantly by cardiovascular  abnormalities, although solid visceral organ, gallbladder, and bowel  abnormalities as well as ascites are also seen, reflecting a multisystemic  inflammatory process. CLINICAL IMPACT. The constellation of imaging findings in  the setting of COVID-19 may alert radiologists to the diagnosis of MIS-C before  rapid deterioration of patients.', 'OBJECTIVE: Although the initial reports of COVID-19 cases in children described  that children were largely protected from severe manifestations, clusters of  paediatric cases of severe systemic hyperinflammation and shock related to  severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 infection began to be reported  in the latter half of April 2020. A novel syndrome called ""multisystem  inflammatory syndrome in children"" (MIS-C) shares common clinical features with  other well-defined syndromes, including Kawasaki disease, toxic shock syndrome  and secondary hemophagocytic lymphohistiocytosis/macrophage activation syndrome.  Our objective was to develop a protocol for the evaluation, treatment and  follow-up of patients with MIS-C. METHODS: The protocol was developed by a multidisciplinary team. We convened a  multidisciplinary working group with representation from the departments of  paediatric critical care, cardiology, rheumatology, surgery, gastroenterology,  haematology, immunology, infectious disease and neurology. Our protocol and  recommendations were based on the literature and our experiences with  multisystem inflammatory syndrome in children. After an agreement was reached  and the protocol was implemented, revisions were made on the basis of expert  feedback. CONCLUSION: Children may experience acute cardiac decompensation or other organ  system failure due to this severe inflammatory condition. Therefore, patients  with severe symptoms of MIS-C should be managed in a paediatric intensive care  setting, as rapid clinical deterioration may occur. Therapeutic approaches for  MIS-C should be tailored depending on the patients\' phenotypes. Plasmapheresis  may be useful as a standard treatment to control hypercytokinemia in cases of  MIS-C with severe symptoms. Long-term follow-up of patients with cardiac  involvement is required to identify any sequelae of MIS-C.', 'BACKGROUND: Recently, cases of multisystem inflammatory syndrome in children  (MIS-C) associated with coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) have been reported  worldwide. Negative polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) testing associated with  positive serology in most of the cases suggests a postinfectious syndrome.  Because the pathophysiology of this syndrome is still poorly understood,  extensive virological and immunological investigations are needed. METHODS: We report a series of 4 pediatric patients admitted to Geneva  University Hospitals with persistent fever and laboratory evidence of  inflammation meeting the published definition of MIS-C related to COVID-19, to  whom an extensive virological and immunological workup was performed. RESULTS: RT-PCRs on multiple anatomical compartments were negative, whereas  anti-severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) immunoglobulin  A (IgA) and immunoglobulin G (IgG) were strongly positive by enzyme-linked  immunosorbent assay and immunofluorescence. Both pseudoneutralization and full  virus neutralization assays showed the presence of neutralizing antibodies in  all children, confirming a recent infection with SARS-CoV-2. The analyses of  cytokine profiles revealed an elevation in all cytokines, as reported in adults  with severe COVID-19. Although differing in clinical presentation, some features  of MIS-C show phenotypic overlap with hemophagocytic lymphohistiocytosis (HLH).  In contrast to patients with primary HLH, our patients showed normal perforin  expression and natural killer (NK) cell degranulation. The levels of soluble  interleukin (IL)-2 receptor (sIL-2R) correlated with the severity of disease,  reflecting recent T-cell activation. CONCLUSION: Our findings suggest that MIS-C related to COVID-19 is caused by a  postinfectious inflammatory syndrome associated with an elevation in all  cytokines, and markers of recent T-cell activation (sIL-2R) occurring despite a  strong and specific humoral response to SARS-CoV-2. Further functional and  genetic analyses are essential to better understand the mechanisms of  host-pathogen interactions.', 'BACKGROUND.

CLINICAL IMPACT. The constellation of imaging findings in  the setting of COVID-19 may alert radiologists to the diagnosis of MIS-C before  rapid deterioration of patients.', 'The World Health Organization is still revising the epidemiology of multi-system  inflammatory syndrome in children (MIS-C) and the preliminary case definition,  although there is a dearth of robust evidence regarding the clinical  presentations, severity, and outcomes. Researchers, epidemiologists, and  clinicians are struggling to characterize and describe the disease phenomenon  while taking care of the diseased persons at the forefronts. This report tackles  the first case of a 13-year-old Saudi female with the MIS-C mimicking Kawasaki  disease. Her main manifestations were fever, gastrointestinal symptoms, evidence  of organ failure with an increase in inflammatory markers, and a history of  coronavirus disease (COVID-19) infection. She had glucose-6-phosphate  dehydrogenase (G6PD) deficiency and no significant previous history of any  disease. She presented with signs of acute illness: high-grade fever (39.6°C)  for five days accompanied by sore throat, malaise, reduced oral intake,  abdominal pain, diarrhea, skin rash, bilateral non-suppurative conjunctivitis,  and erythematous, cracked lips. Eventually, she died despite aggressive  management based on the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention and the Saudi  Ministry of Health guidelines for COVID-19 management. Based on this case, we  suggest that pediatricians need to be aware of such atypical presentations and  early referral to tertiary care is imperative for further early diagnosis and  management. MIS-C is a rare yet severe and highly critical complication of  COVID-19 infection in pediatrics, leading to serious and life-threatening  illnesses. Knowledge about the wide spectrum of presenting signs and symptoms  and disease severity, including early detection and treatment, is pivotal to  prevent a tragic outcome.', 'BACKGROUND: Multisystem inflammatory syndrome temporally associated with  COVID-19 (MIS-C) has been described as a novel and often severe presentation of  SARS-CoV-2 infection in children. We aimed to describe the characteristics of  children admitted to Pediatric Intensive Care Units (PICUs) presenting with  MIS-C in comparison with those admitted with SARS-CoV-2 infection with other  features such as COVID-19 pneumonia. METHODS: A multicentric prospective national registry including 47 PICUs was  carried out. Data from children admitted with confirmed SARS-CoV-2 infection or  fulfilling MIS-C criteria (with or without SARS-CoV-2 PCR confirmation) were  collected. Clinical, laboratory and therapeutic features between MIS-C and  non-MIS-C patients were compared. RESULTS: Seventy-four children were recruited. Sixty-one percent met MIS-C  definition. MIS-C patients were older than non-MIS-C patients (p\u2009=\u20090.002):  9.4\xa0years (IQR 5.5-11.8) vs 3.4\xa0years (IQR 0.4-9.4). A higher proportion of them  had no previous medical history of interest (88.2% vs 51.7%, p\u2009=\u20090.005).  Non-MIS-C patients presented more frequently with respiratory distress (60.7% vs  13.3%, p\u2009<\u20090.001). MIS-C patients showed higher prevalence of fever (95.6% vs  64.3%, p\u2009<\u20090.001), diarrhea (66.7% vs 11.5%, p\u2009<\u20090.001), vomits (71.1% vs 23.1%,  p\u2009=\u20090.001), fatigue (65.9% vs 36%, p\u2009=\u20090.016), shock (84.4% vs 13.8%, p\u2009<\u20090.001)  and cardiac dysfunction (53.3% vs 10.3%, p\u2009=\u20090.001). MIS-C group had a lower  lymphocyte count (p\u2009<\u20090.001) and LDH (p\u2009=\u20090.001) but higher neutrophil count  (p\u2009=\u20090.045), neutrophil/lymphocyte ratio (p\u2009<\u20090.001), C-reactive protein  (p\u2009<\u20090.001) and procalcitonin (p\u2009<\u20090.001). Patients in the MIS-C group were less  likely to receive invasive ventilation (13.3% vs 41.4%, p\u2009=\u20090.005) but were more  often treated with vasoactive drugs (66.7% vs 24.1%, p\u2009<\u20090.001), corticosteroids  (80% vs 44.8%, p\u2009=\u20090.003) and immunoglobulins (51.1% vs 6.9%, p\u2009<\u20090.001). Most  patients were discharged from PICU by the end of data collection with a median  length of stay of 5\xa0days (IQR 2.5-8\xa0days) in the MIS-C group. Three patients  died, none of them belonged to the MIS-C group. CONCLUSIONS: MIS-C seems to be the most frequent presentation among critically  ill children with SARS-CoV-2 infection. MIS-C patients are older and usually  healthy. They show a higher prevalence of gastrointestinal symptoms and shock  and are more likely to receive vasoactive drugs and immunomodulators and less  likely to need mechanical ventilation than non-MIS-C patients.', 'The coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic has impacted the health of  children worldwide. Although overall mortality from COVID-19 in children remains  low, an associated multisystem inflammatory disorder has emerged. The disorder  has been recognized and named multisystem inflammatory syndrome in children  (MIS-C) by the World Health Organization and the Centers for Disease Control and  Prevention. This comprehensive review describes the epidemiology,  pathophysiology, signs and symptoms, other potential diagnoses, and treatments  relevant to MIS-C. The review also includes patient and family education and  anticipatory guidance, and discusses nursing implications for nurses working in  various roles and settings, including direct care, research, and public health.', 'The coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic has caused widespread mortality  and morbidity. Though children are largely spared from severe illness, a novel  childhood hyperinflammatory syndrome presumed to be associated with and  subsequent to severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2)  infection has emerged with potentially severe outcomes. Multisystem inflammatory  disorder in children (MIS-C) most commonly affects young, school-aged children  and is characterized by persistent fever, systemic hyperinflammation, and  multisystem organ dysfunction. While uncommon and generally treatable, MIS-C  presents potentially life-altering medical sequelae, complicated by a dearth of  information regarding its etiology, pathophysiology, and long-term outcomes. The  severity of MIS-C may warrant the need for increased awareness and continued  COVID-19 mitigation efforts, particularly until potential factors conferring a  predisposition to MIS-C can be clarified through additional research.  Well-informed guidelines will be critical as the school year progresses. In this  article, current knowledge on MIS-C is reviewed and the potential implications  of this novel syndrome are discussed from a public health perspective.', 'Multisystem inflammatory syndrome in children (MIS-C) is a life-threatening  post-infectious complication occurring unpredictably weeks after mild or  asymptomatic SARS-CoV2 infection in otherwise healthy children. Here, we define  immune abnormalities in MIS-C compared to adult COVID-19 and pediatric/adult  healthy controls using single-cell RNA sequencing, antigen receptor repertoire  analysis, unbiased serum proteomics, and in vitro assays. Despite no evidence of  active infection, we uncover elevated S100A-family alarmins in myeloid cells and  marked enrichment of serum proteins that map to myeloid cells and pathways  including cytokines, complement/coagulation, and fluid shear stress in MIS-C  patients. Moreover, NK and CD8 T cell cytotoxicity genes are elevated, and  plasmablasts harboring IgG1 and IgG3 are expanded. Consistently, we detect  elevated binding of serum IgG from severe MIS-C patients to activated human  cardiac microvascular endothelial cells in culture. Thus, we define  immunopathology features of MIS-C with implications for predicting and managing  this SARS-CoV2-induced critical illness in children.', 'Multisystem inflammatory syndrome in children (MIS-C) is a novel,  life-threatening hyperinflammatory condition that develops in children a few  weeks after infection with severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus-2  (SARS-CoV-2). This disease has created a diagnostic challenge due to overlap  with Kawasaki disease (KD) and KD shock syndrome. The majority of patients with  MIS-C present with the involvement of at least four organ systems, and all have  evidence of a marked inflammatory state. Most patients show an increase in the  level of at least four inflammatory markers (C-reactive protein, neutrophil  count, ferritin, procalcitonin, fibrinogen, interleukin-6, and triglycerides).  Therapy is primarily with immunomodulators, suggesting that the disease is  driven by post-infectious immune dysregulation. Most patients, even those with  severe cardiovascular involvement, recover without sequelae. Since coronary  aneurysms have been reported, echocardiographic follow-up is needed.Further  study is needed to create uniform diagnostic criteria, therapy, and follow-up  protocols.']]]","The multisystem inflammatory syndrome in children (MIS-C) associated with COVID-19 is a severe and life-threatening condition characterized by:

- Occurring weeks after mild or asymptomatic SARS-CoV-2 infection in healthy children
- Presenting with persistent fever and systemic hyperinflammation 
- Involved in at least four organ systems
- Associated with a marked inflammatory state
- Commonly seen in young, school-aged children
- Characterized by imaging findings of cardiovascular abnormalities, along with solid visceral organ, gallbladder, and bowel abnormalities, and ascites

Which are the enzymes involved in the control of tubulin acetylation?,"[[['TPPP/p25 (tubulin polymerization-promoting protein/p25) is an unstructured  protein that induces microtubule polymerization in vitro and is aligned along  the microtubule network in transfected mammalian cells. In normal human brain,  TPPP/p25 is expressed predominantly in oligodendrocytes, where its expression is  proved to be crucial for their differentiation process. Here we demonstrated  that the expression of TPPP/p25 in HeLa cells, in doxycycline-inducible CHO10  cells, and in the oligodendrocyte CG-4 cells promoted the acetylation of  alpha-tubulin at residue Lys-40, whereas its down-regulation by specific small  interfering RNA in CG-4 cells or by the withdrawal of doxycycline from CHO10  cells decreased the acetylation level of alpha-tubulin. Our results indicate  that TPPP/p25 binds to HDAC6 (histone deacetylase 6), an enzyme responsible for  tubulin deacetylation. Moreover, we demonstrated that the direct interaction of  these two proteins resulted in the inhibition of the deacetylase activity of  HDAC6. The measurement of HDAC6 activity showed that TPPP/p25 is able to induce  almost complete (90%) inhibition at 3 microM concentration. In addition,  treatment of the cells with nocodazole, vinblastine, or cold exposure revealed  that microtubule acetylation induced by trichostatin A, a well known HDAC6  inhibitor, does not cause microtubule stabilization. In contrast, the  microtubule bundling activity of TPPP/p25 was able to protect the microtubules  from depolymerization. Finally, we demonstrated that, similarly to other HDAC6  inhibitors, TPPP/p25 influences the microtubule dynamics by decreasing the  growth velocity of the microtubule plus ends and also affects cell motility as  demonstrated by time lapse video experiments. Thus, we suggest that TPPP/p25 is  a multiple effector of the microtubule organization.', 'The 70kDa ribosomal protein S6 kinases (S6K1 and S6K2) play important roles in  the regulation of protein synthesis, cell growth and survival. S6Ks are  activated in response to mitogen stimulation and nutrient sufficiency by the  phosphorylation of conserved serine and threonine residues. Here we show for the  first time, that in addition to phosphorylation, S6Ks are also targeted by  lysine acetylation. Following mitogen stimulation, S6Ks interact with the p300  and p300/CBP-associated factor (PCAF) acetyltransferases. S6Ks can be acetylated  by p300 and PCAF in vitro and S6K acetylation is detected in cells expressing  p300. Furthermore, it appears that the acetylation sites targeted by p300 lie  within the divergent C-terminal regulatory domains of both S6K1 and S6K2.  Acetylation of S6K1 and 2 is increased upon the inhibition of class I/II histone  deacetylases (HDACs) by trichostatin-A, while the enhancement of S6K1  acetylation by nicotinamide suggests the additional involvement of sirtuin  deacetylases in S6K deacetylation. Both expression of p300 and HDAC inhibition  cause increases in S6K protein levels, and we have shown that S6K2 is stabilized  in cells treated with HDAC inhibitors. The finding that S6Ks are targeted by  histone acetyltransferases uncovers a novel mode of crosstalk between mitogenic  signalling pathways and the transcriptional machinery and reveals additional  complexity in the regulation of S6K function.', ""BACKGROUND: Tubulin is a major substrate of the cytoplasmic class II histone  deacetylase HDAC6. Inhibition of HDAC6 results in higher levels of acetylated  tubulin and enhanced binding of the motor protein kinesin-1 to tubulin, which  promotes transport of cargoes along microtubules. Microtubule-dependent  intracellular trafficking may therefore be regulated by modulating the activity  of HDAC6. We have shown previously that the neuromodulator serotonin increases  mitochondrial movement in hippocampal neurons via the Akt-GSK3beta signaling  pathway. Here, we demonstrate a role for HDAC6 in this signaling pathway. METHODOLOGY/PRINCIPAL FINDINGS: We found that the presence of tubacin, a  specific HDAC6 inhibitor, dramatically enhanced mitochondrial movement in  hippocampal neurons, whereas niltubacin, an inactive tubacin analog, had no  effect. Compared to control cultures, higher levels of acetylated tubulin were  found in neurons treated with tubacin, and more kinesin-1 was associated with  mitochondria isolated from these neurons. Inhibition of GSK3beta decreased  cytoplasmic deacetylase activity and increased tubulin acetylation, whereas  blockade of Akt, which phosphorylates and down-regulates GSK3beta, increased  cytoplasmic deacetylase activity and decreased tubulin acetylation.  Concordantly, the administration of 5-HT, 8-OH-DPAT (a specific 5-HT1A receptor  agonist), or fluoxetine (a 5-HT reuptake inhibitor) increased tubulin  acetylation. GSK3beta was found to co-localize with HDAC6 in hippocampal  neurons, and inhibition of GSK3beta resulted in decreased binding of antibody to  phosphoserine-22, a potential GSK3beta phosphorylation site in HDAC6. GSK3beta  may therefore regulate HDAC6 activity by phosphorylation. CONCLUSIONS/SIGNIFICANCE: This study demonstrates that HDAC6 plays an important  role in the modulation of mitochondrial transport. The link between HDAC6 and  GSK3beta, established here, has important implications for our understanding of  neurodegenerative disorders. In particular, abnormal mitochondrial transport,  which has been observed in such disorders as Alzheimer's disease and Parkinson's  disease, could result from the misregulation of HDAC6 by GSK3beta. HDAC6 may  therefore constitute an attractive target in the treatment of these disorders."", 'Cytoskeleton remodelling is a prerequisite step for the morphological transition  from preadipocytes to mature adipocytes. Although microtubules play a pivotal  role in organizing cellular structure, regulation of microtubule dynamics during  adipogenesis remains unclear. In the present paper we show that acetylation of  α-tubulin is up-regulated during adipogenesis, and adipocyte development is  dependent on α-tubulin acetylation, as expression of an acetylation-resistant  α-tubulin mutant significantly inhibits adipogenesis. Moreover, acetylation of  α-tubulin is under the control of the acetyltransferase MEC-17 and deacetylases  SIRT2 (Sirtuin 2) and HDAC6 (histone deacetylase 6). Adipocyte development is  inhibited in MEC-17-knockdown cells, but enhanced in MEC-17-overexpressing  cells. Finally, we show that katanin, a microtubule-severing protein with  enhanced activity on acetylated α-tubulin, is actively involved in adipogenesis.  We propose that co-ordinated up-regulation of α-tubulin acetylation initiates  cytoskeleton remodelling by promoting α-tubulin severing by katanin which, in  turn, allows expansion of lipid droplets and accelerates the morphological  transition toward mature adipocytes.', ""Mdm2 is a RING finger E3 ubiquitin ligase, which promotes ubiquitination and  proteasomal degradation of the p53 tumor suppressor protein. Acetylation of p53  regulates p53's transcriptional activity and inhibits Mdm2-mediated p53  ubiquitination and degradation. We now report that Mdm2 is also a target for  acetylation. Mdm2 is acetylated in vitro by CREB-binding protein (CBP) and to a  lesser extent by p300, but not by p300/CPB-associated factor. Acetylation occurs  primarily within the RING finger domain of Mdm2. In vivo acetylation of Mdm2 was  detected easily with CBP but not p300. Efficient in vivo acetylation required  the preservation of the RING finger. An Mdm2 mutant (K466/467Q) mimicking  acetylation is impaired in its ability to promote p53 ubiquitination, as well as  Mdm2 autoubiquitination. Moreover, K466/467Q is defective in promoting p53  degradation in living cells. We thus suggest that acetyltransferases may  modulate cellular p53 activity not only by modifying p53, but also by  inactivating Mdm2."", 'Glutamylation, the most prevalent tubulin posttranslational modification, marks  stable microtubules and regulates recruitment and activity of microtubule-  interacting proteins. Nine enzymes of the tubulin tyrosine ligase-like (TTLL)  family catalyze glutamylation. TTLL7, the most abundant neuronal glutamylase,  adds glutamates preferentially to the β-tubulin tail. Coupled with ensemble and  single-molecule biochemistry, our hybrid X-ray and cryo-electron microscopy  structure of TTLL7 bound to the microtubule delineates a tripartite microtubule  recognition strategy. The enzyme uses its core to engage the disordered anionic  tails of α- and β-tubulin, and a flexible cationic domain to bind the  microtubule and position itself for β-tail modification. Furthermore, we  demonstrate that all single-chain TTLLs with known glutamylase activity utilize  a cationic microtubule-binding domain analogous to that of TTLL7. Therefore, our  work reveals the combined use of folded and intrinsically disordered substrate  recognition elements as the molecular basis for specificity among the enzymes  primarily responsible for chemically diversifying cellular microtubules.', 'The human HDAC (histone deacetylase) family, a well-validated anticancer target,  plays a key role in the control of gene expression through regulation of  transcription. While HDACs can be subdivided into three main classes, the class  I, class II and class III HDACs (sirtuins), it is presently unclear whether  inhibiting multiple HDACs using pan-HDAC inhibitors, or targeting specific  isoforms that show aberrant levels in tumours, will prove more effective as an  anticancer strategy in the clinic. To address the above issues, we have tested a  number of clinically relevant HDACis (HDAC inhibitors) against a panel of rhHDAC  (recombinant human HDAC) isoforms. Eight rhHDACs were expressed using a  baculoviral system, and a Fluor de Lystrade mark (Biomol International) HDAC  assay was optimized for each purified isoform. The potency and selectivity of  ten HDACs on class I isoforms (rhHDAC1, rhHDAC2, rhHDAC3 and rhHDAC8) and class  II HDAC isoforms (rhHDAC4, rhHDAC6, rhHDAC7 and rhHDAC9) was determined. MS-275  was HDAC1-selective, MGCD0103 was HDAC1- and HDAC2-selective, apicidin was  HDAC2- and HDAC3-selective and valproic acid was a specific inhibitor of class I  HDACs. The hydroxamic acid-derived compounds (trichostatin A, NVP-LAQ824,  panobinostat, ITF2357, vorinostat and belinostat) were potent pan-HDAC  inhibitors. The growth-inhibitory effect of the HDACis on HeLa cells showed that  both pan-HDAC and class-I-specific inhibitors inhibited cell growth. The results  also showed that both pan-HDAC and class-I-specific inhibitor treatment resulted  in increased acetylation of histones, but only pan-HDAC inhibitor treatment  resulted in increased tubulin acetylation, which is in agreement with their  activity towards the HDAC6 isoform.', 'In most eukaryotic cells, tubulin is subjected to posttranslational  glutamylation, a conserved modification of unclear function. The glutamyl side  chains form as branches of the primary sequence glutamic acids in two  biochemically distinct steps: initiation and elongation. The length of the  glutamyl side chain is spatially controlled and microtubule type specific. Here,  we probe the significance of the glutamyl side chain length regulation in vivo  by overexpressing a potent side chain elongase enzyme, Ttll6Ap, in Tetrahymena.  Overexpression of Ttll6Ap caused hyperelongation of glutamyl side chains on the  tubulin of axonemal, cortical, and cytoplasmic microtubules. Strikingly, in the  same cell, hyperelongation of glutamyl side chains stabilized cytoplasmic  microtubules and destabilized axonemal microtubules. Our observations suggest  that the cellular outcomes of glutamylation are mediated by spatially restricted  tubulin interactors of diverse nature.', 'Neuronal migration is a fundamental process during the development of the  cerebral cortex and is regulated by cytoskeletal components. Microtubule  dynamics can be modulated by posttranslational modifications to tubulin  subunits. Acetylation of α-tubulin at lysine 40 is important in regulating  microtubule properties, and this process is controlled by acetyltransferase and  deacetylase. MEC-17 is a newly discovered α-tubulin acetyltransferase that has  been found to play a major role in the acetylation of α-tubulin in different  species in vivo. However, the physiological function of MEC-17 during neural  development is largely unknown. Here, we report that MEC-17 is critical for the  migration of cortical neurons in the rat. MEC-17 was strongly expressed in the  cerebral cortex during development. MEC-17 deficiency caused migratory defects  in the cortical projection neurons and interneurons, and perturbed the  transition of projection neurons from the multipolar stage to the  unipolar/bipolar stage in the intermediate zone of the cortex. Furthermore,  knockdown of α-tubulin deacetylase HDAC6 or overexpression of tubulin(K40Q) to  mimic acetylated α-tubulin could reduce the migratory and morphological defects  caused by MEC-17 deficiency in cortical projection neurons. Thus, MEC-17, which  regulates the acetylation of α-tubulin, appears to control the migration and  morphological transition of cortical neurons. This finding reveals the  importance of MEC-17 and α-tubulin acetylation in cortical development.', 'Neurotensin (NT), an intestinal peptide secreted from N cells in the small  bowel, regulates a variety of physiological functions of the gastrointestinal  tract, including secretion, gut motility, and intestinal growth. The class IA  phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase (PI3K) family, which comprised of p110 catalytic  (α, β and δ) and p85 regulatory subunits, has been implicated in the regulation  of hormone secretion from endocrine cells. However, the underlying mechanisms  remain poorly understood. In particular, the role of PI3K in intestinal peptide  secretion is not known. Here, we show that PI3K catalytic subunit, p110α,  negatively regulates NT secretion in vitro and in vivo. We demonstrate that  inhibition of p110α, but not p110β, induces NT release in BON, a human endocrine  cell line, which expresses NT mRNA and produces NT peptide in a manner analogous  to N cells, and QGP-1, a pancreatic endocrine cell line that produces NT  peptide. In contrast, overexpression of p110α decreases NT secretion.  Consistently, p110α-inhibition increases plasma NT levels in mice. To further  delineate the mechanisms contributing to this effect, we demonstrate that  inhibition of p110α increases NT granule trafficking by up-regulating α-tubulin  acetylation; NT secretion is prevented by overexpression of HDAC6, an α-tubulin  deacetylase. Moreover, ras-related protein Rab27A (a small G protein) and kinase  D-interacting substrate of 220 kDa (Kidins220), which are associated with NT  granules, play a negative and positive role, respectively, in  p110α-inhibition-induced NT secretion. Our findings identify the critical role  and novel mechanisms for the PI3K signaling pathway in the control of intestinal  hormone granule transport and release.']]]","The enzymes involved in the control of tubulin acetylation mentioned in the context are:

We have  generated a reporter mouse strain by inserting the cDNA for green fluorescent  protein (GFP) into the Gfi1b gene locus which allowed us to follow Gfi1b  expression during hematopoiesis and lymphopoiesis by measuring green  fluorescence. We found highly dynamic expression patterns of Gfi1b in erythroid  cells, megakaryocytes, and their progenitor cells (MEPS) where Gfi1 is not  detected. Vice versa, Gfi1b could not be found in granulocytes, activated  macrophages, or their granulomonocytic precursors (GMPs) or in mature naive or  activated lymphocytes where Gfi1 is expressed, suggesting a complementary  regulation of both loci during hematopoiesis. However, Gfi1b was found to be  up-regulated in early stages of B-cell and in a subset of early T-cell  development, where Gfi1 is also present, suggesting that cross-regulation of  both loci exists but is cell-type specific.', 'BACKGROUND: In erythroblasts, the CoREST repressor complex is recruited to  target promoters by the transcription factor Gfi1b, leading to repression of  genes mainly involved in erythroid differentiation. Hmg20b is a subunit of  CoREST, but its role in erythropoiesis has not yet been established. DESIGN AND METHODS: To study the role of Hmg20b in erythropoiesis, we performed  knockdown experiments in a differentiation-competent mouse fetal liver cell  line, and in primary mouse fetal liver cells. The effects on globin gene  expression were determined. We used microarrays to investigate global gene  expression changes induced by Hmg20b knockdown. Functional analysis was carried  out on Hrasls3, an Hmg20b target gene. RESULTS: We show that Hmg20b depletion induces spontaneous differentiation. To  identify the target genes of Hmg20b, microarray analysis was performed on Hmg20b  knockdown cells and controls. In line with its association to the CoREST  complex, we found that 85% (527 out of 620) of the deregulated genes are  up-regulated when Hmg20b levels are reduced. Among the few down-regulated genes  was Gfi1b, a known repressor of erythroid differentiation. Among the  consistently up-regulated targets were embryonic β-like globins and the  phospholipase HRAS-like suppressor 3 (Hrasls3). We show that Hrasls3 expression  is induced during erythroid differentiation and that knockdown of Hrasls3  inhibits terminal differentiation of proerythroblasts. CONCLUSIONS: We conclude that Hmg20b acts as an inhibitor of erythroid  differentiation, through the down-regulation of genes involved in  differentiation such as Hrasls3, and activation of repressors of differentiation  such as Gfi1b. In addition, Hmg20b suppresses embryonic β-like globins.', 'The family of Gfi-1 zinc finger transcriptional repressor oncoproteins consists  of Gfi-1 and Gfi-1B. Recent gene targeting experiments and mutational screening  in humans have revealed an essential role for Gfi-1 and Gfi-1B in hematopoiesis.  Mice lacking Gfi-1 are unexpectedly neutropenic. Neutrophil differentiation is  abolished and T lymphocyte differentiation is partially blocked in these mice.  Heterozygous germline mutations of Gfi-1 causes severe congenital neutropenia  (SCN) in humans. Ela2, whose germline mutation is the major contributor to  hereditary neutropenias, is repressed in vivo by Gfi-1. Gfi-1B disruption is  embryonic lethal due to a block of erythropoiesis. Gfi-1B is required for both  erythroid and megakaryocyte development. The ongoing identification of repressed  target genes and interacting transcriptional cofactors is helping to unravel the  central contributions of these two hematopoietic factors.', 'Gfi1 is a transcriptional repressor essential for haematopoiesis and inner ear  development. It shares with its paralogue Gfi1b an amino-terminal SNAG repressor  domain and six carboxy-terminal zinc-finger motifs, but differs from Gfi1b in  sequences separating these domains. Here, we describe two knock-in mouse models,  in which the N-terminal SNAG repressor domain was mutated or in which the Gfi1  coding region was replaced by Gfi1b. Mouse mutants without an intact SNAG domain  show the full phenotype of Gfi1 null mice. However, Gfi1:Gfi1b knock-in mice  show almost normal pre-T-cell and neutrophil development, but lack properly  formed inner ear hair cells. Hence, our findings show that an intact SNAG domain  is essential for all functions of Gfi1 and that Gfi1b can replace Gfi1  functionally in haematopoiesis but, surprisingly, not in inner ear hair cell  development, demonstrating that Gfi1 and Gfi1b have equivalent and  domain-dependent, cell type-specific functions.', 'Growth factor-independence 1b (Gfi1b) is a zinc finger transcription factor  essential for erythroid and megakaryocytic development. To better understand  Gfi1b regulation and to know the implication of the level of expression of this  gene in human pathology, we have searched for promoter punctual sequence  variations in 214 patients with different hematological diseases. We found two  previously unknown congenital mutations at evolutionary conserved GATA and  octamer-binding (Oct) transcription factor sites. The Oct site mutation was also  found in five relatives of the patient. The GATA motif mutation reduced promoter  activity by 50% in vitro, while homozygous patients with the octamer site  mutation showed a four-to-five times increase of Gfi1b RNA in platelets.  Electrophoretic mobility shift analyses demonstrated that different protein  complexes bind to both sites and that binding is reduced by the mutations.  Finally, we found that GATA-1 and Oct-1 are the main components of each complex.  This study provides evidences of a new mechanism for Gfi1b repression. This is  also the first report of Gfi1b mutations with a functional implication; further  investigation and follow-up will clarify the involvement of these mutations in  hematological disease.', ""The regulation of gene transcription is elementary for the function of  hematopoietic stem cells (HSCs). The transcriptional repressor growth factor  independence 1 (Gfi1) restricts HSC proliferation and is essential to maintain  their self-renewal capacity and multipotency after transplantation. In addition,  Gfi1(-/-) HSCs are severely compromised in their ability to compete with  wild-type (wt) HSCs after transplantation. We now report that Gfi1 protects HSCs  against stress-induced apoptosis, probably, by repressing the proapoptotic  target gene Bax, since irradiated Gfi1(-/-) HSCs display higher expression of  Bax and show a higher rate of apoptosis than wt HSCs. This protective function  of Gfi1 appears to be functionally relevant since Gfi1(-/-) HSCs that express  Bcl-2, which antagonizes the effects of Bax, regain their ability to self renew  and to initiate multilineage differentiation after transplantation.  Surprisingly, Gfi1(-/-) xBcl-2 transgenic mice also show a strong, systemic  expansion of Mac-1(+) Gr-1(-) myeloid cells in bone marrow and peripheral  lymphoid organs. These cells express high levels of the proleukemogenic  transcription factor Hoxa9 and, in older mice, appear as atypical  monocytoid-blastoid cells in the peripheral blood. As a result of this massive  expansion of myeloid cells, all Gfi1(-/-) xBcl-2 mice eventually succumb to a  myeloproliferative-like disease resembling a preleukemic state. In summary, our  data demonstrate that Gfi1's ability to protect against apoptosis is essential  for HSC function. In addition, our finding show that Gfi1 prevents the  development of myeloproliferative diseases and provides evidence how Gfi1  deficiency could be linked to myeloid leukemia."", 'Histone deacetylase inhibitors represent a family of targeted anticancer  compounds that are widely used against hematological malignancies. So far little  is known about their effects on normal myelopoiesis. Therefore, in order to  investigate the effect of histone deacetylase inhibitors on the myeloid  commitment of hematopoietic stem/progenitor cells, we treated CD34(+) cells with  valproic acid (VPA). Our results demonstrate that VPA treatment induces H4  histone acetylation and hampers cell cycle progression in CD34(+) cells  sustaining high levels of CD34 protein expression. In addition, our data show  that VPA treatment promotes erythrocyte and megakaryocyte differentiation. In  fact, we demonstrate that VPA treatment is able to induce the expression of  growth factor-independent protein 1B (GFI1B) and of mixed-lineage leukemia  translocated to chromosome 3 protein (MLLT3), which are crucial regulators of  erythrocyte and megakaryocyte differentiation, and that the up-regulation of  these genes is mediated by the histone hyperacetylation at their promoter sites.  Finally, we show that GFI1B inhibition impairs erythroid and megakaryocyte  differentiation induced by VPA, while MLLT3 silencing inhibits megakaryocyte  commitment only. As a whole, our data suggest that VPA sustains the expression  of stemness-related markers in hematopoietic stem/progenitor cells and is able  to interfere with hematopoietic lineage commitment by enhancing erythrocyte and  megakaryocyte differentiation and by inhibiting the granulocyte and  mono-macrophage maturation.', 'Gfi-1B is a transcriptional repressor essential for the regulation of  erythropoiesis and megakaryopoiesis. Here we identify Gfi-1B p32, a Gfi-1B  isoform, as essential for erythroid differentiation. Gfi-1B p32 is generated by  alternative splicing and lacks the two first zinc finger domains of the protein.  Selective knock down of Gfi-1B p32 compromises erythroid differentiation,  whereas its ectopic expression induces erythropoiesis in the absence of  erythropoietin. Gfi-1B p32 isoform binds to Gfi-1B target gene promoters and  associates with the LSD1-CoREST repressor complex more efficiently than the  major Gfi-1B p37 isoform. Furthermore, we show that Gfi-1B includes a KSKK motif  in its SNAG domain, which recruits the repressor complex only when dimethylated  on lysine 8. Mutation of lysine 8 prevents Gfi-1B p32-induced erythroid  development. Our results thus highlight a key role for the alternatively spliced  Gfi-1B p32 isoform in erythroid development.', 'Recent studies have established that during embryonic development, hematopoietic  progenitors and stem cells are generated from hemogenic endothelium precursors  through a process termed endothelial to hematopoietic transition (EHT). The  transcription factor RUNX1 is essential for this process, but its main  downstream effectors remain largely unknown. Here, we report the identification  of Gfi1 and Gfi1b as direct targets of RUNX1 and critical regulators of EHT.  GFI1 and GFI1B are able to trigger, in the absence of RUNX1, the down-regulation  of endothelial markers and the formation of round cells, a morphologic change  characteristic of EHT. Conversely, blood progenitors in Gfi1- and  Gfi1b-deficient embryos maintain the expression of endothelial genes. Moreover,  those cells are not released from the yolk sac and disseminated into embryonic  tissues. Taken together, our findings demonstrate a critical and specific role  of the GFI1 transcription factors in the first steps of the process leading to  the generation of hematopoietic progenitors from hemogenic endothelium.', 'The family of Gfi-1 zinc finger transcriptional repressor oncoproteins consists  of Gfi-1 and Gfi-1B.

What is measured through the NOMe-Seq methodology?,"[[['RNA expression profiles produced by next-generation sequencing (NGS) technology  (RNA-seq) allow comprehensive investigation of transcribed sequences within a  cell or tissue. RNA-seq is rapidly becoming more cost-effective for  transcriptome profiling. However, its usage will expand dramatically if one  starts with low amount of RNA and obtains transcript directionality during the  analysis. Here, we describe a detailed protocol for the creation of a  directional RNA-seq library from 100 ng of starting total RNA.', 'The binding and contribution of transcription factors (TF) to cell specific gene  expression is often deduced from open-chromatin measurements to avoid costly TF  ChIP-seq assays. Thus, it is important to develop computational methods for  accurate TF binding prediction in open-chromatin regions (OCRs). Here, we report  a novel segmentation-based method, TEPIC, to predict TF binding by combining  sets of OCRs with position weight matrices. TEPIC can be applied to various  open-chromatin data, e.g. DNaseI-seq and NOMe-seq. Additionally, Histone-Marks  (HMs) can be used to identify candidate TF binding sites. TEPIC computes TF  affinities and uses open-chromatin/HM signal intensity as quantitative measures  of TF binding strength. Using machine learning, we find low affinity binding  sites to improve our ability to explain gene expression variability compared to  the standard presence/absence classification of binding sites. Further, we show  that both footprints and peaks capture essential TF binding events and lead to a  good prediction performance. In our application, gene-based scores computed by  TEPIC with one open-chromatin assay nearly reach the quality of several TF  ChIP-seq data sets. Finally, these scores correctly predict known  transcriptional regulators as illustrated by the application to novel DNaseI-seq  and NOMe-seq data for primary human hepatocytes and CD4+ T-cells, respectively.', ""5-Aza-2'-deoxycytidine, approved by the FDA for the treatment of myelodysplastic  syndrome (MDS), is incorporated into the DNA of dividing cells where it  specifically inhibits DNA methylation by forming covalent complexes with the DNA  methyltransferases (DNMTs). In an effort to study the correlations between DNA  methylation, nucleosome remodeling, and gene reactivation, we investigate the  integrated epigenetic events that worked coordinately to reprogram the  methylated and closed promoters back to permissive chromatin configurations  after 5-Aza-2'-deoxycytidine treatment. The ChIP results indicate that H2A.Z is  deposited at promoter regions by the Snf2-related CBP activator protein (SRCAP)  complex following DNA demethylation. According to our genome-wide expression and  DNA methylation profiles, we find that the complete re-activation of silenced  genes requires the insertion of the histone variant H2A.Z, which facilitates the  acquisition of regions fully depleted of nucleosome as demonstrated by NOMe-seq  (Nucleosome Occupancy Methylome-sequencing) assay. In contrast, SRCAP-mediated  H2A.Z deposition is not required for maintaining the active status of  constitutively expressed genes. By combining Hpa II digestion with NOMe-seq  assay, we show that hemimethylated DNA, which is generated following drug  incorporation, remains occupied by nucleosomes. Our data highlight H2A.Z as a  novel and essential factor involved in 5-Aza-2'-deoxycytidine-induced gene  reactivation. Furthermore, we elucidate that chromatin remodeling translates the  demethylation ability of DNMT inhibitors to their downstream efficacies,  suggesting future therapeutic implications for chromatin remodelers."", 'Transcriptome sequencing allows for analysis of mature RNAs at base pair  resolution. Here we show that RNA-seq can also be used for studying nascent RNAs  undergoing transcription. We sequenced total RNA from human brain and liver and  found a large fraction of reads (up to 40%) within introns. Intronic RNAs were  abundant in brain tissue, particularly for genes involved in axonal growth and  synaptic transmission. Moreover, we detected significant differences in intronic  RNA levels between fetal and adult brains. We show that the pattern of intronic  sequence read coverage is explained by nascent transcription in combination with  co-transcriptional splicing. Further analysis of co-transcriptional splicing  indicates a correlation between slowly removed introns and alternative splicing.  Our data show that sequencing of total RNA provides unique insight into the  transcriptional processes in the cell, with particular importance for normal  brain development.', 'BACKGROUND: Splicing is more efficient when coupled with transcription and it  has been proposed that nucleosomes enriched in exons are important for splice  site recognition. Lynch syndrome is a familial cancer syndrome that can be  caused by the autosomal dominant inheritance of splice site mutations in the  MutL homolog 1 (MLH1) gene. To better understand the role of nucleosomes in  splicing, we used MLH1 splice site mutations in Lynch syndrome cases as a model  to investigate if abnormal splicing was associated with altered nucleosome  positioning at exon-intron boundaries. FINDINGS: Nucleosome Occupancy and Methylome sequencing (NOMe-seq) was used to  determine the allele-specific positioning of nucleosomes around heterozygous  splice site mutations in lymphoblastoid cells lines (LCLs) derived from six  Lynch syndrome patients. These mutations were previously shown to cause exon  skipping in five of the six patients. Allele-specific high-resolution nucleosome  mapping across exons and exon-intron boundaries revealed high levels of  nucleosomes across all regions examined. Alleles containing donor or acceptor  splice site mutations showed no consistent alteration in nucleosome positioning  or occupancy. CONCLUSION: Nucleosomes were enriched at MLH1 exons in LCLs derived from Lynch  syndrome patients, and in this model system the positioning of nucleosomes was  unaltered at exon-intron boundaries containing splice site mutations. Thus,  these splice site mutations alone do not significantly change the local  organisation of nucleosomes.', 'Transcript quantification is a long-standing problem in genomics and estimating  the relative abundance of alternatively-spliced isoforms from the same  transcript is an important special case. Both problems have recently been  illuminated by high-throughput RNA sequencing experiments which are quickly  generating large amounts of data. However, much of the signal present in this  data is corrupted or obscured by biases resulting in non-uniform and  non-proportional representation of sequences from different transcripts. Many  existing analyses attempt to deal with these and other biases with various  task-specific approaches, which makes direct comparison between them difficult.  However, two popular tools for isoform quantification, MISO and Cufflinks, have  adopted a general probabilistic framework to model and mitigate these biases in  a more general fashion. These advances motivate the need to investigate the  effects of RNA-seq biases on the accuracy of different approaches for isoform  quantification. We conduct the investigation by building models of increasing  sophistication to account for noise introduced by the biases and compare their  accuracy to the established approaches. We focus on methods that estimate the  expression of alternatively-spliced isoforms with the percent-spliced-in (PSI)  metric for each exon skipping event. To improve their estimates, many methods  use evidence from RNA-seq reads that align to exon bodies. However, the methods  we propose focus on reads that span only exon-exon junctions. As a result, our  approaches are simpler and less sensitive to exon definitions than existing  methods, which enables us to distinguish their strengths and weaknesses more  easily. We present several probabilistic models of of position-specific read  counts with increasing complexity and compare them to each other and to the  current state-of-the-art methods in isoform quantification, MISO and Cufflinks.  On a validation set with RT-PCR measurements for 26 cassette events, some of our  methods are more accurate and some are significantly more consistent than these  two popular tools. This comparison demonstrates the challenges in estimating the  percent inclusion of alternatively spliced junctions and illuminates the  tradeoffs between different approaches.', 'The study of epigenetic heterogeneity at the level of individual cells and in  whole populations is the key to understanding cellular differentiation,  organismal development, and the evolution of cancer. We develop a statistical  method, epiG, to infer and differentiate between different epi-allelic  haplotypes, annotated with CpG methylation status and DNA polymorphisms, from  whole-genome bisulfite sequencing data, and nucleosome occupancy from NOMe-seq  data. We demonstrate the capabilities of the method by inferring allele-specific  methylation and nucleosome occupancy in cell lines, and colon and tumor samples,  and by benchmarking the method against independent experimental data.', 'BACKGROUND: DNA methylation is an epigenetic modification that is enriched in  heterochromatin but depleted at active promoters and enhancers. However, the  debate on whether or not DNA methylation is a reliable indicator of high  nucleosome occupancy has not been settled. For example, the methylation levels  of DNA flanking CTCF sites are higher in linker DNA than in nucleosomal DNA,  while other studies have shown that the nucleosome core is the preferred site of  methylation. In this study, we make progress toward understanding these  conflicting phenomena by implementing a bioinformatics approach that combines  MNase-seq and NOMe-seq data and by comprehensively profiling DNA methylation and  nucleosome occupancy throughout the human genome. RESULTS: The results demonstrated that increasing methylated CpG density is  correlated with nucleosome occupancy in the total genome and within nearly all  subgenomic regions. Features with elevated methylated CpG density such as exons,  SINE-Alu sequences, H3K36-trimethylated peaks, and methylated CpG islands are  among the highest nucleosome occupied elements in the genome, while some of the  lowest occupancies are displayed by unmethylated CpG islands and unmethylated  transcription factor binding sites. Additionally, outside of CpG islands, the  density of CpGs within nucleosomes was shown to be important for the nucleosomal  location of DNA methylation with low CpG frequencies favoring linker methylation  and high CpG frequencies favoring core particle methylation. Prominent  exceptions to the correlations between methylated CpG density and nucleosome  occupancy include CpG islands marked by H3K27me3 and CpG-poor heterochromatin  marked by H3K9me3, and these modifications, along with DNA methylation,  distinguish the major silencing mechanisms of the human epigenome. CONCLUSIONS: Thus, the relationship between DNA methylation and nucleosome  occupancy is influenced by the density of methylated CpG dinucleotides and by  other epigenomic components in chromatin.', 'MOTIVATION: Allele-specific expression (ASE) refers to the differential  abundance of the allelic copies of a transcript. RNA sequencing (RNA-seq) can  provide quantitative estimates of ASE for genes with transcribed polymorphisms.  When short-read sequences are aligned to a diploid transcriptome, read-mapping  ambiguities confound our ability to directly count reads. Multi-mapping reads  aligning equally well to multiple genomic locations, isoforms or alleles can  comprise the majority (>85%) of reads. Discarding them can result in biases and  substantial loss of information. Methods have been developed that use weighted  allocation of read counts but these methods treat the different types of  multi-reads equivalently. We propose a hierarchical approach to allocation of  read counts that first resolves ambiguities among genes, then among isoforms,  and lastly between alleles. We have implemented our model in EMASE software  (Expectation-Maximization for Allele Specific Expression) to estimate total gene  expression, isoform usage and ASE based on this hierarchical allocation. RESULTS: Methods that align RNA-seq reads to a diploid transcriptome  incorporating known genetic variants improve estimates of ASE and total gene  expression compared to methods that use reference genome alignments. Weighted  allocation methods outperform methods that discard multi-reads. Hierarchical  allocation of reads improves estimation of ASE even when data are simulated from  a non-hierarchical model. Analysis of RNA-seq data from F1 hybrid mice using  EMASE reveals widespread ASE associated with cis-acting polymorphisms and a  small number of parent-of-origin effects.

What is known about the Digit Ratio (2D:4D) cancer?,"[[[""The androgen receptor gene (AR) contains a domain which includes a variable  number of CAG sequences and alleles with low numbers of CAG repeats show high  transactivation activity when complexed with testosterone. The ratio of 2nd and  4th digit length (2D:4D) is negatively correlated with phenotypic effects of  testosterone. Low numbers of CAG repeats and low 2D:4D are both associated with  high sperm numbers and protection against breast cancer. This suggests that CAG  number and 2D:4D are correlated i.e. low CAG number and low 2D:4D indicate high  activation of androgen-responsive genes. Findings from AR studies predict that  low 2D:4D will be associated with prostate and hepatocellular cancer,  urolithiasis, ADHD, ankylosing spondylitis, spontaneous abortion, and polycystic  ovaries, while high 2D:4D will be associated with motor neuron diseases and  endometrial cancer. Findings from 2D:4D studies predict that short CAG length  will be common in autism and Asperger's syndrome, while high numbers of CAG  repeats will be found in men who are prone to early myocardial infarction."", 'OBJECTIVES: To analyze the validity of the ratio between the second and fourth  finger (digit ratio; 2D/4D) of the left hand as a predictor for prostate cancer  (PCa) in a group of men undergoing prostate biopsy. METHODS: We prospectively recruited 204 consecutive patients referred for  transrectal prostate biopsy due to PSA elevation or abnormal digital rectal  examination between January 2008 and June 2009. The same physician performed all  clinical examinations, digit ratio measurements and transrectal biopsy in all  cases. Digit ratio determination was done with a Vernier caliper in the left  hand. Patients underwent determination of hormone profile (testosterone and  sexual hormone binding globulin (SHBG)) between 7:00AM and 11:00AM. Age, digital  rectal examination, PSA, free PSA, PSA density, testosterone and SHBG,  pathological report and D2 and D4 measurements were recorded prospectively. RESULTS: Variables age and SHBG were directly related to PCa. Prostate volume  was inversely related to neoplasia. 2D/4D ratio >0,95 (OR (CI 95%) 4,4  (1,491-13,107) was related to neoplasia. No differences in PCa were seen  regarding PSA, free PSA, PSA density, digital rectal examination and  testosterone. CONCLUSION: High digit ratio predicts PCa in men undergoing prostate biopsy.  Digit ratio >0,95 has 4-fold risk of PCa compared to men with digit ratio ≤0.95.', 'Second-to-fourth digit ratio (2D:4D), a widely studied putative marker for  masculinization through prenatal androgen exposure, is lower (more masculinized)  in athletes than in general population controls, and athletes with lower 2D:4D  have higher sporting success. Occupations differ markedly in perceived  masculinity and actual maleness (sex ratios), but these givens have not yet been  picked up and utilized in 2D:4D research. Accordingly, this study extended  existing accounts on 2D:4D in athletes to a novel approach: 2D:4D and possible  relationships to a variety of candidate variables (demographic,  fertility-related, psychological, and other) were investigated in firefighters,  a highly male-dominated occupation. Contrary to expectation, 2D:4D in  firefighters (N = 134) was not lower than in local male population controls.  Lower 2D:4D corresponded to lower service ranks. Replicating previous findings  either unequivocally or partly, lower 2D:4D was associated with larger family  size, later sibling position, left-handedness, and higher scores in the  disinhibition component of sensation seeking. Not replicating prior evidence,  2D:4D was unrelated to body-mass index, offspring sex ratio, and sporting  performance level. Novel findings included low 2D:4D in those with low  relationship satisfaction and in cigarette smokers, especially among heavy  smokers. Absolute finger length, a positive correlate of pubertal-adolescent  androgen levels, was also considered. This marker showed negative associations  with relationship consensus and satisfaction and positive ones with perceived  quality of relationship alternatives and the experience seeking component of  sensation seeking. The merits of this additional marker, relative to 2D:4D, for  supplementing studies of possible sex-hormonal effects on personality and  directions for future inquiry along these lines are discussed.', 'OBJECTIVES: Digit ratio, especially second-to-fourth digit ratio (2D:4D) is  established in utero and is positively correlated with oestrogen in men and  women. It is a putative biomarker for prenatal hormone exposure and may  represent an individual predisposition to certain diseases (e.g., breast  cancer). The aim of the present study is to investigate whether there is a link  between digit ratio (2D:4D) and breast cancer in Chinese populations. METHODS: The controls we chose were healthy subjects-age and -sex matched to the  patients diagnosed with breast cancer. Photocopies of the two hands of 218 women  (controls: 109; patients: 109) were collected. Left hand, right hand, mean hand,  and right minus left 2D:4D (Dr-l ) were analyzed. RESULTS: The patients with breast cancer presented significantly higher 2D:4D  than controls (left: P < 0.01; right: P < 0.05; mean: P < 0.05). The mean values  of 2D:4D on the left hand were significantly higher than those on the right hand  in the two groups, respectively (controls: P < 0.05; patients: P ≤ 0.01). In  patients, there was a significantly negative correlation between 2D:4D (left  hand: P < 0.01; right hand, mean: P < 0.05) and the presented age with breast  cancer, but no association between Dr-l and age of presented disease. CONCLUSIONS: Digit ratio (2D:4D) may correlate with the increased risk of breast  cancer.', ""Over the past decade a small evidence base has highlighted the potential  importance of seemingly innocuous variables related to one's hands, such as hand  dominance and the relative length of the second and fourth digits (2D:4D ratio),  to success in sport. This study compared 2D:4D digit ratio and handedness among  handball players selected to advance in a national talent development system  with those not selected. Participants included 480 youth handball players (240  females and 240 males) being considered as part of the talent selection  programme for the German Youth National team. Hand dominance and digit ratio  were compared to age-matched control data using standard t-tests. There was a  greater proportion of left-handers compared to the normal population in males  but not in females. There was also a lower digit ratio in both females and  males. However, there were no differences between those selected for the next  stage of talent development and those not selected on either handedness or digit  ratio. These results add support for general effects for both digit ratio and  handedness in elite handball; however, these factors seem inadequate to explain  talent selection decisions at this level."", ""The relative length of the second and fourth digits (2D:4D) is thought to be  negatively related to prenatal testosterone and positively related to prenatal  estrogen. Low 2D:4D has been linked to various measures of performance in a  range of sports (e.g., soccer, rugby). In this study, we consider the  relationship between 2D:4D and performance among male surfers. Our sample  comprised 46 competitors in the Men's 5-star Professional World Qualifying  Series surfing competition in Newquay, United Kingdom, in 2009. Three  experienced surfing coaches rated the participants for overall surfing ability.  The coach's ratings were significantly correlated with one another and an  overall measure of surfing performance was obtained by calculating the mean of  the 3 ratings. In addition, the final placing of the Newquay competition was  used as an additional performance measure. Mean 2D:4D (SD) was as follows: right  0.994 (0.023) and left 0.976 (0.028). We found that right 2D:4D (but not left  2D:4D or right-left 2D:4D) was significantly negatively correlated with coaches'  ratings (r(s) = 0.58) and the competition result (r(s) = 0.30). It appears that  in line with other sports that low right 2D:4D (high prenatal testosterone and  low prenatal estrogen) correlates to high surfing ability in men."", ""BACKGROUND: Research on early life exposures and testicular germ cell tumors  (TGCT) risk has focused on a possible perinatal etiology with a well-known  hypothesis suggesting that hormonal involvement during fetal life is associated  with risk. Second-to-fourth digit ratio (2D:4D) and left-hand dominance have  been proposed as markers of prenatal hormone exposure. AIM: To evaluate associations between 2D:4D digit ratio, right minus left 2D:4D  (ΔR-L), and left-hand dominance and TGCT in the U.S. Servicemen's Testicular  Tumor Environmental and Endocrine Determinants Study. METHODS: A total of 246 TGCT cases and 236 non-testicular cancer controls  participated in the current study, and completed a self-administered  questionnaire. Associations between digit ratio, hand dominance and TGCT were  estimated using unconditional logistic regression adjusting for identified  covariates. RESULTS: Right 2D:4D was not associated with TGCT [odds ratio (OR) for a  one-standard deviation (SD) increase in right-hand 2D:4D: 1.12, 95% confidence  interval (CI): 0.93-1.34]. The results were consistent when evaluating the  association based on the left hand. The difference between right and left-hand  2D:4D was also not associated with TGCT risk [OR for a one-SD increase in ΔR-L:  1.03, 95% CI: 0.87-1.23]. Compared to men who reported right-hand dominance,  ambidexterity [OR (95% CI)=0.65 (0.30-1.41)] and left-hand dominance [OR (95%  CI)=0.79 (0.44-1.44)] were not associated with risk. CONCLUSIONS: These results do not support the hypothesis that prenatal hormonal  imbalance is associated with TGCT risk. Given the limited sample size, further  evaluation of the relationship between TGCT and prenatal hormonal factors using  digit ratio, ΔR-L, or left-hand dominance and larger sample size are warranted."", 'Our objective was to propose a testable hypothesis arising from the recent  finding of a low index-to-ring finger ratio (2D:4D ratio) in ALS. The 2D:4D  ratio finding suggests that prenatal testosterone exposure may play a role in  the development of the disease. Research from other fields is presented to  suggest that healthy individuals with low 2D:4D ratio have enhanced sporting  prowess, particularly with regard to activities requiring endurance and  dependent upon slow-twitch muscles. Although studies are of varying quality,  some epidemiological findings in ALS also suggest enhanced sporting prowess, as  well as a higher risk of developing the disease among members of certain  physically active professions. If the 2D:4D finding survives replication then  this might explain the reported elevated risk of ALS among professional  athletes, the military, and manual professions. Such a relationship might also  explain why ALS patients were more likely to have been elite sportspeople in  younger life. This hypothesis may serve as a starting point for debate and  discussion over the nature of ALS risk factors, as well as generating a number  of specific testable hypotheses that may yield insight into the genesis of the  disease.', 'OBJECTIVE: To investigate the relationships between 2nd to 4th digit ratio  (digit ratio) and prostate cancer detection rate and biopsy findings, including  Gleason score. MATERIALS AND METHODS: In 770 consecutive men aged 40 years or older that  presented with lower urinary tract symptoms (LUTS), right hand 2nd and 4th digit  lengths were measured prior to PSA determinations, DRE and transrectal  ultrasonography (TRUS). Among these, 166 men with a prostate specific antigen  (PSA) level ≥ 3 ng/mL or abnormal digit rectal examination (DRE) prospectively  underwent prostate biopsies. The relationship between digit ratio and prostate  cancer detection rate and biopsy findings was investigated. RESULTS: The study subjects were allocated to two groups by digit ratio (group  A: digit ratio < 0.95; n = 420; group B: digit ratio ≥ 0.95; n = 350). Despite  similar biopsy rates (22.4% vs. 20.6%, p = 0.544), group A had higher cancer  detection rate (46.8% (44/94) vs. 23.6% (17/72), p = 0.002; OR = 2.847, 95% CI =  1.445-5.610). When we analyzed 408 positive biopsy cores (group A: digit ratio <  0.95, n = 282; group B: digit ratio ≥ 0.95, n = 126), group A had higher  percentage of core cancer volume (46.7% vs. 37.1%, p = 0.005) and more biopsy  cores with high Gleason score (sum of Gleason score ≥ 9: 18/282 (6.4%) vs. 1/126  (0.8%), p = 0.010; primary Gleason score = 5: 12/282 (4.3%) vs. 0/126 (0.0%), p  = 0.021). CONCLUSIONS: A lower digit ratio is related to an increased detection rate of  prostate cancer, a high percentage of core cancer volume and a high Gleason  score.', 'BACKGROUND: The ratio of digit lengths is fixed in utero, and may be a proxy  indicator for prenatal testosterone levels. METHODS: We analysed the right-hand pattern and prostate cancer risk in 1524  prostate cancer cases and 3044 population-based controls. RESULTS: Compared with index finger shorter than ring finger (low 2D\u2009:\u20094D), men  with index finger longer than ring finger (high 2D\u2009:\u20094D) showed a negative  association, suggesting a protective effect with a 33% risk reduction (odds  ratio (OR) 0.67, 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.57-0.80). Risk reduction was  even greater (87%) in age group <60 (OR 0.13, 95% CI 0.09-0.21). CONCLUSION: Pattern of finger lengths may be a simple marker of prostate cancer  risk, with length of 2D greater than 4D suggestive of lower risk.']]]","The Digit Ratio (2D:4D) has been shown to be associated with an increased risk of prostate cancer. Specifically:

- A lower 2D:4D ratio (indicating higher prenatal testosterone exposure) has been linked to a higher detection rate of prostate cancer.
- Men with a lower 2D:4D ratio tend to have a higher percentage of core cancer volume in prostate biopsies.
- They also have a higher percentage of biopsy cores with high Gleason scores, indicating more aggressive cancer.

However, it's important to note that while correlations have been observed, they do not definitively prove causation. Further research is needed to fully understand the relationship between 2D:4D and prostate cancer risk.","[{'Exact': array([  6.03984116,   2.99455633,   1.08049855,  -1.06103086,

How does Rif1 regulate DNA replication?,"[[['The replication of eukaryotic chromosomes is organized temporally and spatially  within the nucleus through epigenetic regulation of replication origin function.  The characteristic initiation timing of specific origins is thought to reflect  their chromatin environment or sub-nuclear positioning, however the mechanism  remains obscure. Here we show that the yeast Forkhead transcription factors,  Fkh1 and Fkh2, are global determinants of replication origin timing. Forkhead  regulation of origin timing is independent of local levels or changes of  transcription. Instead, we show that Fkh1 and Fkh2 are required for the  clustering of early origins and their association with the key initiation factor  Cdc45 in G1 phase, suggesting that Fkh1 and Fkh2 selectively recruit origins to  emergent replication factories. Fkh1 and Fkh2 bind Fkh-activated origins, and  interact physically with ORC, providing a plausible mechanism to cluster  origins. These findings add a new dimension to our understanding of the  epigenetic basis for differential origin regulation and its connection to  chromosomal domain organization.', 'How the cellular amount of mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) is regulated under normal  conditions and in the presence of genotoxic stress is less understood. We  demonstrate that the inefficient mtDNA replication process of mutant yeast cells  lacking the PIF1 DNA helicase is partly rescued in the absence of the DNA  helicase RRM3. The rescue effect is likely due to the increase in the  deoxynucleoside triphosphates (dNTPs) pool caused by the lack of RRM3. In  contrast, the Pif1p-dependent mtDNA breakage in the presence and absence of  genotoxic stress is not suppressed if RRM3 is lacking suggesting that this  phenotype is likely independent of the dNTP pool. Pif1 protein (Pif1p) was found  to stimulate the incorporation of dNTPs into newly synthesised mtDNA of  gradient-purified mitochondria. We propose that Pif1p that acts likely as a DNA  helicase in mitochondria affects mtDNA replication directly. Possible roles of  Pif1p include the resolution of secondary DNA and/or DNA/RNA structures, the  temporarily displacement of tightly bound mtDNA-binding proteins, or the  stabilization of the mitochondrial replication complex during mtDNA replication.', 'One of the mechanisms controlling the initiation of DNA replication is the  dynamic interaction between Cdt1, which promotes assembly of the pre-replication  license complex, and Geminin, which inhibits it. Specifically, Cdt1 cooperates  with the cell cycle protein Cdc6 to promote loading of the minichromosome  maintenance helicases (MCM) onto the chromatin-bound origin recognition complex  (ORC), by directly interacting with the MCM complex, and by modulating histone  acetylation and inducing chromatin unfolding. Geminin, on the other hand,  prevents the loading of the MCM onto the ORC both by directly binding to Cdt1,  and by modulating Cdt1 stability and activity. Protein levels of Geminin and  Cdt1 are tightly regulated through the cell cycle, and the Cdt1-Geminin complex  likely acts as a molecular switch that can enable or disable the firing of each  origin of replication. In this review we summarize structural studies of Cdt1  and Geminin and subsequent insights into how this molecular switch may function  to ensure DNA is faithfully replicated only once during S phase of each cell  cycle.', 'One of the long-standing questions in eukaryotic DNA replication is the  mechanisms that determine where and when a particular segment of the genome is  replicated. Cdc7/Hsk1 is a conserved kinase required for initiation of DNA  replication and may affect the site selection and timing of origin firing. We  identified rif1Δ, a null mutant of rif1(+), a conserved telomere-binding factor,  as an efficient bypass mutant of fission yeast hsk1. Extensive deregulation of  dormant origins over a wide range of the chromosomes occurs in rif1Δ in the  presence or absence of hydroxyurea (HU). At the same time, many early-firing,  efficient origins are suppressed or delayed in firing timing in rif1Δ. Rif1  binds not only to telomeres, but also to many specific locations on the arm  segments that only partially overlap with the prereplicative complex assembly  sites, although Rif1 tends to bind in the vicinity of the late/dormant origins  activated in rif1Δ. The binding to the arm segments occurs through M to G1 phase  in a manner independent of Taz1 and appears to be essential for the replication  timing program during the normal cell cycle. Our data demonstrate that Rif1 is a  critical determinant of the origin activation program on the fission yeast  chromosomes.', 'Origins of DNA replication on eukaryotic genomes have been observed to fire  during S phase in a coordinated manner. Studies in yeast indicate that origin  firing is affected by several factors, including checkpoint regulators and  chromatin modifiers. However, it is unclear what the mechanisms orchestrating  this coordinated process are. Recent studies have identified factors that  regulate the timing of origin activation, including Rif1 which plays crucial  roles in the regulation of the replication timing program in yeast as well as in  higher eukaryotes. In mammalian cells, Rif1 appears to regulate the structures  of replication timing domains through its ability to organize chromatin loop  structures. Regulation of chromatin architecture by Rif1 may be linked to other  chromosome transactions including recombination, repair, or transcription. This  review summarizes recent progress in the effort to elucidate the regulatory  mechanisms of replication timing of eukaryotic replicons.', 'DNA replication in eukaryotes requires nucleosome disruption ahead of the  replication fork and reassembly behind. An unresolved issue concerns how histone  dynamics are coordinated with fork progression to maintain chromosomal  stability. Here, we characterize a complex in which the human histone chaperone  Asf1 and MCM2-7, the putative replicative helicase, are connected through a  histone H3-H4 bridge. Depletion of Asf1 by RNA interference impedes DNA  unwinding at replication sites, and similar defects arise from overproduction of  new histone H3-H4 that compromises Asf1 function. These data link Asf1 chaperone  function, histone supply, and replicative unwinding of DNA in chromatin. We  propose that Asf1, as a histone acceptor and donor, handles parental and new  histones at the replication fork via an Asf1-(H3-H4)-MCM2-7 intermediate and  thus provides a means to fine-tune replication fork progression and histone  supply and demand.', 'Mammalian Rif1 is a key regulator of DNA replication timing, double-stranded DNA  break repair, and replication fork restart. Dissecting the molecular functions  of Rif1 is essential to understand how it regulates such diverse processes.  However, Rif1 is a large protein that lacks well defined functional domains and  is predicted to be largely intrinsically disordered; these features have  hampered recombinant expression of Rif1 and subsequent functional  characterization. Here we applied ESPRIT (expression of soluble proteins by  random incremental truncation), an in vitro evolution-like approach, to identify  high yielding soluble fragments encompassing conserved regions I and II (CRI and  CRII) at the C-terminal region of murine Rif1. NMR analysis showed CRI to be  intrinsically disordered, whereas CRII is partially folded. CRII binds cruciform  DNA with high selectivity and micromolar affinity and thus represents a  functional DNA binding domain. Mutational analysis revealed an α-helical region  of CRII to be important for cruciform DNA binding and identified critical  residues. Thus, we present the first structural study of the mammalian Rif1,  identifying a domain that directly links its function to DNA binding. The high  specificity of Rif1 for cruciform structures is significant given the role of  this key protein in regulating origin firing and DNA repair.', ""DNA double strand breaks (DSBs) are highly toxic to the cells and accumulation  of DSBs results in several detrimental effects in various cellular processes  which can lead to neurological, immunological and developmental disorders.  Failure of the repair of DSBs spurs mutagenesis and is a driver of  tumorigenesis, thus underscoring the importance of the accurate repair of DSBs.  Two major canonical DSB repair pathways are the non-homologous end joining  (NHEJ) and homologous recombination (HR) pathways. 53BP1 and BRCA1 are the key  mediator proteins which coordinate with other components of the DNA repair  machinery in the NHEJ and HR pathways respectively, and their exclusive  recruitment to DNA breaks/ends potentially decides the choice of repair by  either NHEJ or HR. Recently, Rap1 interacting factor 1 has been identified as an  important component of the DNA repair pathway which acts downstream of the  ATM/53BP1 to inhibit the 5'-3' end resection of broken DNA ends, in-turn  facilitating NHEJ repair and inhibiting homology directed repair. Rif1 is  conserved from yeast to humans but its function has evolved from telomere length  regulation in yeast to the maintenance of genome integrity in mammalian cells.  Recently its role in the maintenance of genomic integrity has been expanded to  include the regulation of chromatin structure, replication timing and intra-S  phase checkpoint. We present a summary of these important findings highlighting  the various aspects of Rif1 functions and discuss the key implications for  genomic integrity."", 'Replication forks encounter impediments as they move through the genome,  including natural barriers due to stable protein complexes and highly  transcribed genes. Unlike lesions generated by exogenous damage, natural  barriers are encountered in every S phase. Like humans, Schizosaccharomyces  pombe encodes a single Pif1 family DNA helicase, Pfh1. Here, we show that Pfh1  is required for efficient fork movement in the ribosomal DNA, the mating type  locus, tRNA, 5S ribosomal RNA genes, and genes that are highly transcribed by  RNA polymerase II. In addition, converged replication forks accumulated at all  of these sites in the absence of Pfh1. The effects of Pfh1 on DNA replication  are likely direct, as it had high binding to sites whose replication was  impaired in its absence. Replication in the absence of Pfh1 resulted in DNA  damage specifically at those sites that bound high levels of Pfh1 in wild-type  cells and whose replication was slowed in its absence. Cells depleted of Pfh1  were inviable if they also lacked the human TIMELESS homolog Swi1, a replisome  component that stabilizes stalled forks. Thus, Pfh1 promotes DNA replication and  separation of converged replication forks and suppresses DNA damage at  hard-to-replicate sites.', 'Rif1, originally recognized for its role at telomeres in budding yeast, has been  implicated in a wide variety of cellular processes in mammals, including  pluripotency of stem cells, response to double-strand breaks, and breast cancer  development. As the molecular function of Rif1 is not known, we examined the  consequences of Rif1 deficiency in mouse cells. Rif1 deficiency leads to failure  in embryonic development, and conditional deletion of Rif1 from mouse embryo  fibroblasts affects S-phase progression, rendering cells hypersensitive to  replication poisons. Rif1 deficiency does not alter the activation of the DNA  replication checkpoint but rather affects the execution of repair. RNA  interference to human Rif1 decreases the efficiency of homology-directed repair  (HDR), and Rif1 deficiency results in aberrant aggregates of the HDR factor  Rad51. Consistent with a role in S-phase progression, Rif1 accumulates at  stalled replication forks, preferentially around pericentromeric  heterochromatin. Collectively, these findings reveal a function for Rif1 in the  repair of stalled forks by facilitating HDR.']]]","Rif1 regulates DNA replication by influencing the timing and activation of replication origins. It plays a crucial role in the replication timing program, affecting the activation of origins on fission yeast chromosomes. Rif1 binds to multiple sites on chromosomes, particularly near late/dormant origins, and its binding is associated with changes in origin firing timing. In mammalian cells, Rif1 regulates chromatin architecture, which may impact replication timing domains. Additionally, Rif1 helps organize chromatin loops and interacts with other factors like Pif1 to influence DNA replication. It also regulates the structures of replication timing domains, potentially linking it to other chromosome transactions such as recombination, repair, or transcription. Rif1's function includes maintaining genome integrity, coordinating replication timing, and facilitating homologous recombination repair (HDR). Its depletion leads to issues with S-phase progression and affects the execution of repair processes.","[{'Exact': array([  9.89662921,   8.54450494,   3.36686795, 112.16171652,

Summarize the function of DEAH helicase DHX36 and its role in G-quadruplex-dependent processes.,"[[['G-quadruplexes are four-stranded helical nucleic acid structures formed by  guanine-rich sequences. A considerable number of studies have revealed that  these noncanonical structural motifs are widespread throughout the genome and  transcriptome of numerous organisms, including humans. In particular,  G-quadruplexes occupy strategic locations in genomic DNA and both coding and  noncoding RNA molecules, being involved in many essential cellular and  organismal functions. In this review, we first outline the fundamental  structural features of G-quadruplexes and then focus on the concept that these  DNA and RNA structures convey a distinctive layer of epigenetic information that  is critical for the complex regulation, either positive or negative, of  biological activities in different contexts. In this framework, we summarize and  discuss the proposed mechanisms underlying the functions of G-quadruplexes and  their interacting factors. Furthermore, we give special emphasis to the  interplay between G-quadruplex formation/disruption and other epigenetic marks,  including biochemical modifications of DNA bases and histones, nucleosome  positioning, and three-dimensional organization of chromatin. Finally,  epigenetic roles of RNA G-quadruplexes in post-transcriptional regulation of  gene expression are also discussed. Undoubtedly, the issues addressed in this  review take on particular importance in the field of comparative epigenetics, as  well as in translational research.', 'DHX36 is a member of the DExD/H box helicase family, which comprises a large  number of proteins involved in various cellular functions.

G4s are alternative nucleic acid structures, which influence many cellular  pathways on a transcriptional and post-transcriptional level. In this review we  provide an overview of the current knowledge about DHX36 structure, substrate  specificity, and mechanism of action based on the available models and crystal  structures. Moreover, we outline its multiple functions in cellular homeostasis,  immunity, and disease. Finally, we discuss the open questions and provide  potential directions for future research.', ""G-Quadruplex (G4) DNA (G4 DNA) and RNA (G4 RNA) are secondary nucleic acid  structures that have multiple roles in vital cellular processes.

DEAH-Box helicase 36  (DHX36), a member of the large DExD/H box helicase family, enzymatically unwinds  both G4 DNA and G4 RNA. By exerting its G4 helicase function, DHX36 regulates  transcription, genomic stability, telomere maintenance, translation and RNA  metabolism.

Organisms across all kingdoms have evolved diverse and  highly efficient repair mechanisms to protect the genome from deleterious  consequences of various genotoxic factors that might tend to destabilize the  integrity of the genome in each generation. One such group of proteins that is  actively involved in genome surveillance is the RecQ helicase family. These  proteins are highly conserved DNA helicases, which have diverse roles in  multiple DNA metabolic processes such as DNA replication, recombination and DNA  repair. In humans, five RecQ helicases have been identified and three of them  namely, WRN, BLM and RecQL4 have been linked to genetic diseases characterized  by genome instability, premature aging and cancer predisposition. This helicase  family plays important roles in various DNA repair pathways including protecting  the genome from illegitimate recombination during chromosome segregation in  mitosis and assuring genome stability. This review mainly focuses on various  roles of human RecQ helicases in the process of recombination-based DNA repair  to maintain genome stability and physiological consequences of their defects in  the development of cancer and premature aging.', ""'If G-quadruplexes form so readily in vitro, Nature will have found a way of  using them in vivo' (Statement by Aaron Klug over 30 years ago).During the last  decade, four-stranded helical structures called G-quadruplex (or G4) have  emerged from being a structural curiosity observed in vitro, to being recognized  as a possible nucleic acid based mechanism for regulating multiple biological  processes in vivo. The sequencing of many genomes has revealed that they are  rich in sequence motifs that have the potential to form G-quadruplexes and that  their location is non-random, correlating with functionally important genomic  regions. In this short review, we summarize recent evidence for the in vivo  presence and function of DNA and RNA G-quadruplexes in various cellular pathways  including DNA replication, gene expression and telomere maintenance. We also  highlight remaining open questions that will have to be addressed in the future."", 'Most of the proteins carrying the 23-residue MutT-related sequence are capable  of hydrolyzing compounds with a general structure of nucleoside diphosphate  linked to another moiety X and are called the Nudix hydrolases. Among the 22  human Nudix proteins (identified by the sequence signature), some remain  uncharacterized as enzymes without a defined substrate. Here, we reveal that the  NUDT18 protein, whose substrate was unknown, can degrade  8-oxo-7,8-dihydroguanine (8-oxo-Gua)-containing nucleoside diphosphates to the  monophosphates. Because this enzyme is closely related to MTH1 (NUDT1) and MTH2  (NUDT15), we propose that it should be named MTH3. Although these three human  proteins resemble each other in their sequences, their substrate specificities  differ considerably. MTH1 cleaves 8-oxo-dGTP but not 8-oxo-dGDP, whereas MTH2  can degrade both 8-oxo-dGTP and 8-oxo-dGDP, although the intrinsic enzyme  activity of MTH2 is considerably lower than that of MTH1. On the other hand,  MTH3 is specifically active against 8-oxo-dGDP and hardly cleaves 8-oxo-dGTP.  Other types of oxidized nucleoside diphosphates, 2-hydroxy-dADP and  8-hydroxy-dADP, were also hydrolyzed by MTH3. Another notable feature of the  MTH3 enzyme is its action toward the ribonucleotide counterpart. MTH3 can  degrade 8-oxo-GDP as efficiently as 8-oxo-dGDP, which is in contrast to the  finding that MTH1 and MTH2 show a limited activity against the ribonucleotide  counterpart, 8-oxo-GTP. These three enzymes may function together to help  maintain the high fidelity of DNA replication and transcription under oxidative  stress.', ""DEAD box proteins are putative RNA helicases that function in all aspects of RNA  metabolism, including translation, ribosome biogenesis, and pre-mRNA splicing.  Because many processes involving RNA metabolism are spatially organized within  the cell, we examined the subcellular distribution of a human DEAD box protein,  DDX1, to identify possible biological functions. Immunofluorescence labeling of  DDX1 demonstrated that in addition to widespread punctate nucleoplasmic  labeling, DDX1 is found in discrete nuclear foci approximately 0.5 microm in  diameter. Costaining with anti-Sm and anti-promyelocytic leukemia (PML)  antibodies indicates that DDX1 foci are frequently located next to Cajal  (coiled) bodies and less frequently, to PML bodies. Most importantly, costaining  with anti-CstF-64 antibody indicates that DDX1 foci colocalize with cleavage  bodies. By microscopic fluorescence resonance energy transfer, we show that  labeled DDX1 resides within a Förster distance of 10 nm of labeled CstF-64  protein in both the nucleoplasm and within cleavage bodies.  Coimmunoprecipitation analysis indicates that a proportion of CstF-64 protein  resides in the same complex as DDX1.

G4s play key roles as DNA regulatory sites and as  kinetic traps that can inhibit biological processes, but how G4s are regulated  in cells remains largely unknown. Here, we developed a kinetic framework for G4  disruption by DEAH-box helicase 36 (DHX36), the dominant G4 resolvase in human  cells. Using tetramolecular DNA and RNA G4s with four to six G-quartets, we  found that DHX36-mediated disruption is highly efficient, with rates that depend  on G4 length under saturating conditions (kcat) but not under subsaturating  conditions (kcat/Km ). These results suggest that a step during G4 disruption  limits the kcat value and that DHX36 binding limits kcat/Km Similar results were  obtained for unimolecular DNA G4s. DHX36 activity depended on a 3' ssDNA  extension and was blocked by a polyethylene glycol linker, indicating that DHX36  loads onto the extension and translocates 3'-5' toward the G4. DHX36 unwound  dsDNA poorly compared with G4s of comparable intrinsic lifetime. Interestingly,  we observed that DHX36 has striking 3'-extension sequence preferences that  differ for G4 disruption and dsDNA unwinding, most likely arising from  differences in the rate-limiting step for the two activities. Our results  indicate that DHX36 disrupts G4s with a conventional helicase mechanism that is  tuned for great efficiency and specificity for G4s. The dependence of DHX36 on  the 3'-extension sequence suggests that the extent of formation of genomic G4s  may not track directly with G4 stability."", 'RNA helicases of the DEAH/RHA family form a large and conserved class of enzymes  that remodel RNA protein complexes (RNPs) by translocating along the RNA. Driven  by ATP hydrolysis, they exert force to dissociate hybridized RNAs, dislocate  bound proteins or unwind secondary structure elements in RNAs. The sub-cellular  localization of DEAH-helicases and their concomitant association with different  pathways in RNA metabolism, such as pre-mRNA splicing or ribosome biogenesis,  can be guided by cofactor proteins that specifically recruit and simultaneously  activate them. Here we review the mode of action of a large class of  DEAH-specific adaptor proteins of the G-patch family. Defined only by their  eponymous short glycine-rich motif, which is sufficient for helicase binding and  stimulation, this family encompasses an immensely varied array of domain  compositions and is linked to an equally diverse set of functions. G-patch  proteins are conserved throughout eukaryotes and are even encoded within  retroviruses. They are involved in mRNA, rRNA and snoRNA maturation, telomere  maintenance and the innate immune response. Only recently was the structural and  mechanistic basis for their helicase enhancing activity determined. We summarize  the molecular and functional details of G-patch-mediated helicase regulation in  their associated pathways and their involvement in human diseases.', 'The unwinding of nucleic acid secondary structures within cells is crucial to  maintain genomic integrity and prevent abortive transcription and translation  initiation. DHX36, also known as RHAU or G4R1, is a DEAH-box ATP-dependent  helicase highly specific for DNA and RNA G-quadruplexes (G4s). A fundamental  mechanistic understanding of the interaction between helicases and their G4  substrates is important to elucidate G4 biology and pave the way toward  G4-targeted therapies. Here we analyze how the thermodynamic stability of G4  substrates affects binding and unwinding by DHX36. We modulated the stability of  the G4 substrates by varying the sequence and the number of G-tetrads and by  using small, G4-stabilizing molecules. We found an inverse correlation between  the thermodynamic stability of the G4 substrates and rates of unwinding by  DHX36. In stark contrast, the ATPase activity of the helicase was largely  independent of substrate stability pointing toward a decoupling mechanism akin  to what has been observed for many double-stranded DEAD-box RNA helicases. Our  study provides the first evidence that DHX36 uses a local, non-processive  mechanism to unwind G4 substrates, reminiscent of that of eukaryotic initiation  factor 4A (eIF4A) on double-stranded substrates.']]]","DEAH helicase DHX36 is a highly specific enzyme for unwinding DNA and RNA G-quadruplexes. It plays a crucial role in various biological processes by regulating G-quadruplex formation and disruption. DHX36 is involved in maintaining genomic integrity, influencing transcription, gene expression, and telomere maintenance. Its function is critical for cellular homeostasis, immunity, and disease. DHX36 can bind to and unwind both G-quadruplex DNA and RNA, demonstrating its versatility in regulating these structures. The enzyme's activity depends on a 3' ssDNA extension and is influenced by the sequence of the G-quadruplex. DHX36's unwinding mechanism is thought to be local and non-processive, similar to eIF4A on double-stranded substrates.","[{'Exact': array([ 5.32773267, 30.41830882, 20.57413203, -1.54822388, 10.78526653,

What is the Drosophila melanogaster Groucho protein?,"[[['A sulfated glycoprotein was isolated from the culture media of Drosophila Kc  cells and named papilin. Affinity purified antibodies against this protein  localized it primarily to the basement membranes of embryos. The antibodies  cross-reacted with another material which was not sulfated and appeared to be  the core protein of papilin, which is proteoglycan-like. After reduction,  papilin electrophoresed in sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel  electrophoresis as a broad band of about 900,000 apparent molecular weight and  the core protein as a narrow band of approximately 400,000. The core protein was  formed by some cell lines and by other cells on incubation with 1 mM  4-methylumbelliferyl xyloside, which inhibited formation of the  proteoglycan-like form. The buoyant density of papilin in CsCl/4 M guanidine  hydrochloride is 1.4 g/ml, that of the core protein is much less. Papilin forms  oligomers linked by disulfide bridges, as shown by sodium dodecyl  sulfate-agarose gel electrophoresis and electron microscopy. The protomer is a  225 +/- 15-nm thread which is disulfide-linked into a loop with fine, protruding  thread ends. Oligomers form clover-leaf-like structures. The protein contains  22% combined serine and threonine residues and 25% combined aspartic and  glutamic residues. 10 g of polypeptide has attached 6.4 g of glucosamine, 3.1 g  of galactosamine, 6.1 g of uronic acid, and 2.7 g of neutral sugars. There are  about 80 O-linked carbohydrate chains/core protein molecule. Sulfate is attached  to these chains. The O-linkage is through an unidentified neutral sugar. Papilin  is largely resistant to common glycosidases and several proteases. The degree of  sulfation varies with the sulfate concentration of the incubation medium. This  proteoglycan-like glycoprotein differs substantially from corresponding  proteoglycans found in vertebrate basement membranes, in contrast to Drosophila  basement membrane laminin and collagen IV which have been conserved  evolutionarily.', 'Drosophila Groucho (Gro) is the founding member of a family of metazoan  corepressors. Gro mediates repression through interactions with a myriad of  DNA-binding repressor proteins to direct the silencing of genes involved in many  developmental processes, including neurogenesis and patterning of the main body  axis, as well as receptor tyrosine kinase/Ras/MAPK, Notch, Wingless (Wg)/Wnt,  and Decapentaplegic (Dpp) signaling. Gro mediates repression by multiple  molecular mechanisms, depending on the regulatory context. Because Gro is a  broadly expressed nuclear factor, whereas its repressor partners display  restricted temporal and spatial distribution, it was presumed that this  corepressor played permissive rather than instructive roles in development.  However, a wide range of studies demonstrates that this is not the case. Gro can  sense and integrate many cellular inputs to modulate the expression of variety  of genes, making it a versatile corepressor with crucial instructive roles in  development and signaling.', 'The Groucho (Gro)/transducin-like enhancer of split family of transcriptional  corepressors are implicated in many signalling pathways that are important in  development and disease, including those mediated by Notch, Wnt and Hedgehog.  Here, we describe a genetic screen in Drosophila that yielded 50 new gro  alleles, including the first protein-null allele, and has two mutations in the  conserved Q oligomerization domain that have been proposed to have an essential  role in corepressor activity. One of these latter mutations, encoding an  amino-terminal protein truncation that lacks part of the Q domain, abolishes  oligomerization in vitro and renders the protein unstable in vivo. Nevertheless,  the mutation is not a null: maternal mutant embryos have intermediate  segmentation phenotypes and relatively normal terminal patterning suggesting  that the mutant protein retains partial corepressor activity. Our results show  that homo-oligomerization of Gro is not obligatory for its action in vivo, and  that Gro represses transcription through more than one molecular mechanism.', 'The Groucho/Tle family of corepressor proteins has important roles in  development and in adult tissue in both Protostomes and Deuterostomes. In  Drosophila, a single member of this family has been identified. Unlike in  Protostomes, most Deutrostomes contain more than two full-length Tle genes. In  this study, I analyse the genomic organization and phylogenetic relationship  between the long and short forms of the Groucho/Tle family members in Chordata.  The genomic location and sequence similarities suggest that Aes/Grg5 and  Tle6/Grg6 arose from duplication of the Tle2 gene; each evolved independently  and acquired new functions as negative regulators of the other Tle proteins.  Based on these data, a model for Groucho/Tle gene evolution is proposed.', 'Groucho proteins are abundant and broadly expressed nuclear factors that lack  intrinsic DNA-binding activity but can interact with a variety of DNA-binding  proteins. The recruitment of Groucho to specific gene regulatory sequences  results in transcriptional repression. In both invertebrates and vertebrates,  Groucho family members act as important regulators of several signaling  mechanisms, including the Notch, Wingless/Wnt and Dpp/BMP/TGF-beta signaling  pathways. Recent studies of embryonic development in several species point to an  important role for Groucho in the regulation of multiple patterning and  differentiation events. Moreover, a deregulated expression of human Groucho  family members is correlated with several neoplastic conditions. Here we focus  on the functions of Groucho proteins during body patterning and their  implication in tumorigenesis.', 'The yellow locus in Drosophila is involved in both cuticle development and  behaviour. However, the function of the encoded protein is unknown. Here we have  characterised the sequence and expression pattern of a new Drosophila gene,  designated yellow-B, encoding a 453-amino-acid protein that is 57% identical to  Yellow. High levels of yellow-B mRNA are present in the larval-pupal stages, but  the gene is also expressed in the head. Bioinformatics analysis indicates that  the Drosophila genome encodes at least 7 members of the Yellow family  distributed among chromosomes 2, 3, and X. The Yellow proteins are related to  the Royal Jelly proteins and have no relatives in other non-insect metazoan  species. Interestingly, a Yellow-like protein is encoded by the genome of a  radiation tolerant bacterium, Deinococcus radiodurans.', ""In this minireview, we briefly revisit the Drosophila Notch and epidermal growth  factor receptor pathways, and relate to the relationship between them. We then  mainly focus on the involvement of Groucho (Gro)/TLE, a global developmental  corepressor, in these pathways. In particular, we discuss Gro/TLE's role at the  junction between these two signal transduction cascades."", 'Transcriptional repressors function primarily by recruiting co-repressors, which  are accessory proteins that antagonize transcription by modifying chromatin  structure. Although a repressor could function by recruiting just a single  co-repressor, many can recruit more than one, with Drosophila Brinker (Brk)  recruiting the co-repressors CtBP and Groucho (Gro), in addition to possessing a  third repression domain, 3R. Previous studies indicated that Gro is sufficient  for Brk to repress targets in the wing, questioning why it should need to  recruit CtBP, a short-range co-repressor, when Gro is known to be able to  function over longer distances. To resolve this we have used genomic engineering  to generate a series of brk mutants that are unable to recruit Gro, CtBP and/or  have 3R deleted. These reveal that although the recruitment of Gro is necessary  and can be sufficient for Brk to make an almost morphologically wild-type fly,  it is insufficient during oogenesis, where Brk must utilize CtBP and 3R to  pattern the egg shell appropriately. Gro insufficiency during oogenesis can be  explained by its downregulation in Brk-expressing cells through phosphorylation  downstream of EGFR signaling.', 'The Grg gene encodes a 197-amino-acid protein homologous to the amino-terminal  domain of the product of the groucho gene of the Drosophila Enhancer of split  complex. We describe here the genomic organization of the mouse Grg gene. It  spans approximately 7 kb on chromosome 10 and consists of seven exons. The 3\'  region of the Grg gene contains two functional polyadenylation sites that give  rise to two transcripts that are differentially expressed among adult mouse  tissues. The promoter region is very GC rich and lacks TATA box and ""initiator""  sequences. Primer extension analysis and ribonuclease protection assays show  that Grg has a major transcription start site situated down-stream of putative  binding motifs for the transcription factors Sp1, E2A, and PuF.', 'The caudal homeobox (cdx) gene family is critical for specification of caudal  body formation and erythropoiesis. In zebrafish, cdx4 expression is controlled  by the Wnt pathway, but the molecular mechanism of this regulation is not fully  understood. Here, we provide evidence that Tcf3 suppresses cdx4 expression  through direct binding to multiple sites in the cdx4 gene regulatory region.  Tcf3 requires corepressor molecules such as Groucho (Gro)/TLE and HDAC1 for  activity. Using zebrafish embryos and cultured mammalian cells, we show that the  transcription factor E4f1 derepresses cdx4 by dissociating corepressor proteins  from Tcf3 without inhibiting its binding to cis-regulatory sites in the DNA.  Further, the E3 ubiquitin ligase Lnx2b, acting as a scaffold protein  irrespective of its enzymatic activity, counteracts the effects of E4f1. We  propose that the modulation of Tcf3 repressor function by E4f1 assures precise  and robust regulation of cdx4 expression in the caudal domain of the embryo.']]]","The Drosophila melanogaster Groucho (Gro) protein is a corepressor involved in gene regulation.

We investigated  burosumab, a monoclonal antibody that targets FGF-23, in patients with X-linked  hypophosphatemia. METHODS: In an open-label, phase 2 trial, we randomly assigned 52 children with  X-linked hypophosphatemia, in a 1:1 ratio, to receive subcutaneous burosumab  either every 2 weeks or every 4 weeks; the dose was adjusted to achieve a serum  phosphorus level at the low end of the normal range. The primary end point was  the change from baseline to weeks 40 and 64 in the Thacher rickets severity  total score (ranging from 0 to 10, with higher scores indicating greater disease  severity). In addition, the Radiographic Global Impression of Change was used to  evaluate rachitic changes from baseline to week 40 and to week 64. Additional  end points were changes in pharmacodynamic markers, linear growth, physical  ability, and patient-reported outcomes and the incidence of adverse events. RESULTS: The mean Thacher rickets severity total score decreased from 1.9 at  baseline to 0.8 at week 40 with every-2-week dosing and from 1.7 at baseline to  1.1 at week 40 with every-4-week dosing (P<0.001 for both comparisons); these  improvements persisted at week 64. The mean serum phosphorus level increased  after the first dose in both groups, and more than half the patients in both  groups had levels within the normal range (3.2 to 6.1 mg per deciliter [1.0 to  2.0 mmol per liter]) by week 6. Stable serum phosphorus levels were maintained  through week 64 with every-2-week dosing. Renal tubular phosphate reabsorption  increased from baseline in both groups, with an overall mean increase of 0.98 mg  per deciliter (0.32 mmol per liter). The mean dose of burosumab at week 40 was  0.98 mg per kilogram of body weight with every-2-week dosing and 1.50 mg per  kilogram with every-4-week dosing. Across both groups, the mean serum alkaline  phosphatase level decreased from 459 U per liter at baseline to 369 U per liter  at week 64. The mean standing-height z score increased in both groups, with  greater improvement seen at all time points with every-2-week dosing (an  increase from baseline of 0.19 at week 64) than with every-4-week dosing (an  increase from baseline of 0.12 at week 64). Physical ability improved and pain  decreased. Nearly all the adverse events were mild or moderate in severity. CONCLUSIONS: In children with X-linked hypophosphatemia, treatment with  burosumab improved renal tubular phosphate reabsorption, serum phosphorus  levels, linear growth, and physical function and reduced pain and the severity  of rickets.

They have been seen after the introduction of modern lipid-lowering drugs more  regularly. The first description after medication with clofibrate dates back to  1968. Apparently, all fibrates can induce myopathy. It usually starts after a  few days of medication, or after prolonged use, showing muscle weakness and/or  pain. Concomitantly, the enzyme creatininephosphokinase (CPK) is raised  dramatically. Muscular necrosis can follow leading secondarily to kidney  failure, and eventually to death. For the class of statins, myopathy was more  often seen after their introduction, and it became their most feared adverse  effect, especially in combination of statins with other drugs (mibefradil,  gemfibrozil, cyclosporin). In animal models the evolution of the disease and the  mechanism of action may be elucidated. Though strong epidemiological data are  lacking, the incidence of myopathy is probably similar for all lipid-lowering  drugs and is in the range of 0.1-0.5% with monotherapy, increasing to 0.5-2.5%  with combination therapy. Severe cases of rhabdomyolysis are rarer, but may have  a significant mortality. The market success of cerivastatin within a short  period has led to 100s of myopathies and some dozens of deaths. Though  interactions on metabolism and ensuing high plasma levels can partially explain  myopathy as intoxication, there are strong indications that other (endocrine,  metabolic, genetic) factors might play a role in the pathophysiology. The  patient population at risk should better be defined and withheld from  myopathy-inducing drugs.', 'Colesevelam hydrochloride and lanthanum carbonate interfere with the absorption  of levothyroxine.', 'INTRODUCTION: Balovaptan, an investigational vasopressin 1a receptor antagonist  that has been evaluated for improvement of social communication and interaction,  is primarily metabolized by cytochrome P450 3A4 (CYP3A4). METHODS: Two single-center, non-randomized, two-period, phase 1 studies assessed  the effect of the strong CYP3A4 inhibitor itraconazole (study NCT03579719) or  the strong CYP3A4 inducer rifampicin (study NCT03586726) at steady state on the  pharmacokinetics (PK) of steady-state balovaptan in healthy volunteers.  Participants received balovaptan (5 or 10\xa0mg/day) alone for 10\xa0days, or in  combination with itraconazole (200\xa0mg/day) for 15\xa0days, or rifampicin  (600\xa0mg/day) for 10\xa0days, following balovaptan washout and  itraconazole/rifampicin pre-dosing. Geometric mean ratios (GMRs) and 90%  confidence intervals (90% CIs) for the area under the concentration-time curve  over the dosing interval (AUC) and maximum plasma concentration (Cmax) of  balovaptan dosed with vs. without itraconazole/rifampicin were estimated from a  mixed effects model. RESULTS: Both studies comprised 15-16 healthy male and female volunteers.  Itraconazole 200\xa0mg/day elevated steady-state exposure to 5\xa0mg/day balovaptan  approximately 4.5-5.5-fold (Day 15 GMR [90% CI], 4.46 [4.06-4.90] for Cmax and  5.57 [5.00-6.21] for AUC) and extended the time to steady state from\u2009~\u20095\xa0days  to\u2009~\u200913-14\xa0days. Rifampicin 600\xa0mg/day resulted in\u2009~\u200990% reductions in both the  Cmax (Day 10 GMR [90% CI], 0.14 [0.12-0.15]) and AUC (0.07 [0.06-0.07]) of  balovaptan 10\xa0mg/day. Time to balovaptan steady state could not be determined  with rifampicin. There were no clinically significant safety findings in either  study. CONCLUSIONS: Strong modulators of CYP3A4 activity will significantly alter the  PK of balovaptan, with the effect of CYP3A4 induction greater than that of  inhibition. Caution should be taken when concomitantly dosing balovaptan with  moderate or strong CYP3A4 inducers or strong CYP3A4 inhibitors. TRIAL REGISTRATION NUMBER: NCT03579719; NCT03586726.', 'We developed an outpatient salvage chemotherapy regimen using bendamustine,  ofatumumab, carboplatin and etoposide (BOCE) to treat relapsed/refractory  non-Hodgkin lymphoma (RR NHL) in a single-center phase I/II study. Primary  objectives were safety, tolerability and overall response rate (ORR).  Thirty-five RR NHL patients (57% de novo large cell [DLBCL] or grade 3B  follicular [FL], 26% transformed DLBCL, 9% grade 3A FL, 3% mantle cell; median  age = 62, median prior therapies = 1) were treated. Median follow-up was  24.1\u2009months. ORR was 69% (CR = 49%, PR = 20% [ORR = 70%, CR = 50%, PR = 20% in  the de novo DLBCL/grade 3B FL subgroup]). Median progression-free survival was  5.1\u2009months and overall-survival 26.2\u2009months. Twelve patients subsequently  underwent stem cell transplantation. The most common non-hematologic grade 3-4  toxicities were neutropenic fever and hypophosphatemia. There were no  treatment-related deaths. In conclusion, BOCE is a safe and effective outpatient  salvage regimen for patients with RR NHL and serves as an effective bridge to  stem cell transplantation.', ""Persistent mild to moderate hyperoxaluria (PMMH) is a common side effect of  bariatric surgery. However, PMMH's role in the progression to calcium oxalate  (CaOx) urolithiasis and its potential effects on non-renal tissues are unknown.  To address these points, a trigger\xa0+\xa0maintenance (T\xa0+\xa0Mt) model of PMMH was  developed in rats (Experiment 1). The trigger was an i.p. injection of PBS  (TPBS) or 288\xa0μmol sodium oxalate (T288). Maintenance (Mt) was given via  minipumps dispensing PBS or 7.5-30\xa0μmol potassium oxalate/day for 28\xa0days.  Urinary oxalate ranged from 7.7\xa0±\xa00.8\xa0μmol/day for TPBS\xa0+\xa0MtPBS to  18.2\xa0±\xa01.5\xa0μmol/day for T288\xa0+\xa0Mt30 (p\xa0≤\xa00.0005). All rats receiving T288  developed CaOx nephrocalcinosis, and many developed 'stones'. This was also true  for Mt doses that did not elevate urinary oxalate above that of TPBS\xa0+\xa0MtPBS  (p\xa0>\xa00.1) and for rats that did not have a detectable surge in urinary oxalate  post T288. When TPBS was administered, CaOx nephrocalcinosis did not develop  regardless of the Mt dose even if urinary oxalate was elevated compared to  TPBS\xa0+\xa0MtPBS (p\xa0≤\xa00.0005). One of the risks associated with PMMH is oxalate  accumulation within tissues. Hence, in a second set of experiments (Experiment  2) different doses of oxalate (Mt0.05, Mt15, Mt30) labeled with (14)C-oxalate  ((14)C-Ox) were administered by minipump for 13\xa0days. Tissues were harvested and  (14)C-Ox accumulation assessed by scintillation counting. (14)C-Ox accumulated  in a dose dependent manner (p\xa0≤\xa00.004) in bone, kidney, muscle, liver, heart,  kidney, lungs, spleen, and testis. All these tissues exhibited (14)C-Ox  concentrations higher (p\xa0≤\xa00.05) than the plasma. Extrapolation of our results  to patients suggests that PMMH patients should take extra care to avoid  dietary-induced spikes in oxalate excretion to help prevent CaOx  nephrocalcinosis or stone development. Monitoring for oxalate accumulation  within tissues susceptible to damage by oxalate or CaOx crystals may also be  required."", 'OBJECTIVE: To provide an outline of the drugs and nutritional therapy that could  contribute to the development of hypophosphatemia in the critically ill patient. DATA SOURCES: Computerized abstracting services, references to primary  literature articles, and review publications were screened for references to  drug- or nutrition-related hypophosphatemia. STUDY SELECTION: Studies primarily describing responses in adults were selected.  Animal research is described that illustrates findings in humans. DATA EXTRACTION: Information was abstracted from the findings of individual case  reports and clinical trials. DATA SYNTHESIS: Data are organized by mechanism of possible effect on serum  phosphate concentration. No reference is made to drugs that do not have an  effect on phosphate metabolism. CONCLUSIONS: Hypophosphatemia can have significant effects that would hinder  recovery of the critically ill patient. Antacids, catecholamines,  beta-adrenergic agonists, sodium bicarbonate, and acetazolamide are commonly  used therapeutic agents that could contribute significantly to the development  of hypophosphatemia. Provision of nutrition to the chronically malnourished  individual or chronic administration of phosphate-depleted parenteral nutrition  could produce symptoms associated with hypophosphatemia. Other drugs could have  a mild effect on lowering serum phosphate concentrations, but would be unlikely  to produce symptoms unless combined with other etiologies of hypophosphatemia.', 'BACKGROUND: Temsirolimus is an mTOR antagonist with proven anticancer efficacy.  Preclinical data suggest greater anticancer effect when mTOR inhibitors are  combined with cytotoxic chemotherapy. We performed a Phase I assessment of the  combination of temsirolimus and capecitabine in patients with advanced solid  tumors. METHODS: Patients were enrolled in an alternating dose escalation of  temsirolimus (at 15 or 25\xa0mg IV weekly) and capecitabine (at 750, 1000, and  1250\xa0mg/m2 twice daily) in separate Q2-week and Q3-week cohorts. At the  recommended Phase II doses (RP2Ds) of temsirolimus and capecitabine (Q2), seven  patients were also treated with oxaliplatin (85\xa0mg/m2 , day 1)\xa0to determine  triplet combination safety and efficacy. RESULTS: Forty-five patients were enrolled and 41 were evaluable\xa0for  dose-limiting toxicities (DLTs). The most common adverse events (AEs) were  mucositis, fatigue, and thrombocytopenia. The most common grade 3/4 AEs were  hypophosphatemia and anemia. Five patients had DLTs, including hypophosphatemia,  mucositis, and thrombocytopenia. The RP2Ds were temsirolimus 25\xa0mg +capecitabine  1000\xa0mg/m2 (Q2); and temsirolimus 25\xa0mg +capecitabine 750\xa0mg/m2 \xa0(Q3). Of the 38  patients evaluable for response, one had a partial response (PR) and 19 had  stable disease (SD). The overall disease control rate was 52%. Five of the 20  patients with SD/PR maintained disease control for >6\xa0months. CONCLUSIONS: The combination of temsirolimus and capecitabine is safe on both a  Q2-week and a Q3-week schedule. The combination demonstrated promising evidence  of disease control in this highly refractory population and could be considered  for testing in disease-specific phase II trials.', 'Imatinib is the drug of first choice for most patients with chronic phase  chronic myeloid leukemia (CML). Although it is generally well tolerated, a  number of hematological and nonhematological side-effects have been described.  We report here that imatinib induces hypophosphatemia in a high proportion of  our series of CML patients previously treated with interferon alpha, and that  this previously unreported side effect is associated with response.', 'Administration of intravenous ferric carboxymaltose (FCM) for iron-deficient  patients suffering heart failure with reduced ejection fraction (HFrEF) has been  associated with transient hypophosphatemia. We sought to investigate and model  the effect of intravenous FCM on phosphate levels in iron-deficient patients  with HFrEF. In this single-center retrospective study, serum phosphate levels,  recorded for clinical reasons, were collected out to 60 days following  intravenous FCM. Hypophosphatemia was defined as a nadir serum phosphate level  <0.64\xa0mmol/L. This was further categorized as severe (0.4 to <0.64\xa0mmol/L) and  extreme (<0.4\xa0mmol/L). Factors associated with hypophosphatemia and change in  serum phosphate over time were explored. Of 173 patients included, 47 (27%)  experienced hypophosphatemia, 44 (25%) were classified as severe, and 3 (2%)  extreme. Risk of hypophosphatemia was increased for patients with a creatinine  clearance between 60 and <90\xa0mL/min (odds ratio, 2.3; 95% confidence interval,  1.0-5.5), while <60\xa0mL/min was protective. The median time to nadir in patients  who experienced hypophosphatemia was 8 (interquartile range, 4-16) days, with a  return to baseline levels at 6 weeks. Biochemically relevant hypophosphatemia is  common following a single dose of intravenous FCM. The median time to nadir was  8 days, and creatinine clearance may influence phosphate levels following  intravenous FCM. These observations support the need to increase awareness among  clinicians administering intravenous FCM to iron-deficient patients with HFrEF.']]]","The drugs associated with Drug-Induced Hypophosphatemia mentioned in the context are:

Is H4K20 methylation associated with DNA replication?,"[[['In contrast to normal cells, cancer cells exhibit both genetic and epigenetic  instability. These unique properties give rise to genetic and epigenetic  heterogeneity in a given population of cancer cells and provide a means for the  population to undergo phenotypic progression by clonal selection. DNA  methylation at CpG dinucleotides is one of the epigenetic marks that are  frequently disturbed in cancer cells. To understand how the CpG methylation  pattern is changeable in cancer cells, it is necessary to know how it is  faithfully maintained in normal cell proliferation. Toward this goal, we have  developed a novel in vitro system that is based on the well-established SV40 in  vitro replication system and functions to reconstitute concurrent DNA  replication and DNA maintenance methylation reactions. We found that DNA  methylation was maintained only when exogenous DNA methyltransferase 1 (DNMT1)  and S-adenosyl methionine (SAM) were added to the reaction. We demonstrated that  DNMT1 associates with replicating and/or replicated chromatin irrespective of  the DNA methylation status of template DNA. Moreover, the PCNA-binding domain  (PBD) of DNMT1 is not required for the association. Taken together, we suggest  that DNMT1 is recruited to replicating and/or replicated chromatin in a  constitutive manner independent of the DNA methylation reaction. The in vitro  system described in this report is very useful for analyzing the molecular  mechanism underlying the DNA maintenance methylation reaction.', 'Extensive changes in DNA methylation are common in cancer and may contribute to  oncogenesis through transcriptional silencing of tumor-suppressor genes.  Genome-scale studies have yielded important insights into these changes but have  focused on CpG islands or gene promoters. We used whole-genome bisulfite  sequencing (bisulfite-seq) to comprehensively profile a primary human colorectal  tumor and adjacent normal colon tissue at single-basepair resolution. Regions of  focal hypermethylation in the tumor were located primarily at CpG islands and  were concentrated within regions of long-range (>100 kb) hypomethylation. These  hypomethylated domains covered nearly half of the genome and coincided with late  replication and attachment to the nuclear lamina in human cell lines. We  confirmed the confluence of hypermethylation and hypomethylation within these  domains in 25 diverse colorectal tumors and matched adjacent tissue. We propose  that widespread DNA methylation changes in cancer are linked to silencing  programs orchestrated by the three-dimensional organization of chromatin within  the nucleus.', 'The enzymatic control of the setting and maintenance of symmetric and  non-symmetric DNA methylation patterns in a particular genome context is not  well understood. Here, we describe a comprehensive analysis of DNA methylation  patterns generated by high resolution sequencing of hairpin-bisulfite amplicons  of selected single copy genes and repetitive elements (LINE1, B1,  IAP-LTR-retrotransposons, and major satellites). The analysis unambiguously  identifies a substantial amount of regional incomplete methylation maintenance,  i.e. hemimethylated CpG positions, with variant degrees among cell types.  Moreover, non-CpG cytosine methylation is confined to ESCs and exclusively  catalysed by Dnmt3a and Dnmt3b. This sequence position-, cell type-, and  region-dependent non-CpG methylation is strongly linked to neighboring CpG  methylation and requires the presence of Dnmt3L. The generation of a  comprehensive data set of 146,000 CpG dyads was used to apply and develop  parameter estimated hidden Markov models (HMM) to calculate the relative  contribution of DNA methyltransferases (Dnmts) for de novo and maintenance DNA  methylation. The comparative modelling included wild-type ESCs and mutant ESCs  deficient for Dnmt1, Dnmt3a, Dnmt3b, or Dnmt3a/3b, respectively. The HMM  analysis identifies a considerable de novo methylation activity for Dnmt1 at  certain repetitive elements and single copy sequences. Dnmt3a and Dnmt3b  contribute de novo function. However, both enzymes are also essential to  maintain symmetrical CpG methylation at distinct repetitive and single copy  sequences in ESCs.', 'The correlation between DNA methylation and a subset of histone  post-translational modifications (positive and negative) has hinted at an  underlying regulatory crosstalk between histone marks and DNA methylation in  patterning the human DNA methylome, an idea further supported by corresponding  alterations to both histone marks and DNA methylation during malignant  transformation. This study investigated the framework by which histone marks  influence DNA methylation at a genome-wide level. Using RNAi in a pluripotent  human embryonic carcinoma cell line we depleted essential components of the  MLL/COMPASS, polycomb repressive complex 2 (PRC2), and PRC1 histone modifying  complexes that establish, respectively, the post-translational modifications  H3K4me3, H3K27me3, and H2AK119ub, and assayed the impact of the subsequent  depletion of these marks on the DNA methylome. Absence of H2AK119ub resulted  predominantly in hypomethylation across the genome. Depletion of H3K4me3 and,  surprisingly, H3K27me3 caused CpG island hypermethylation at a subset of loci.  Intriguingly, many promoters were co-regulated by all three histone marks,  becoming hypermethylated with loss of H3K4me3 or H3K27me3 and hypomethylated  with depletion of H2AK119ub, and many of these co-regulated loci were among  those commonly targeted for aberrant hypermethylation in cancer. Taken together,  our results elucidate novel roles for polycomb and MLL/COMPASS in regulating DNA  methylation and define targets of this regulation.', 'Maintenance of genomic integrity is essential to ensure normal organismal  development and to prevent diseases such as cancer. Nuclear DNA is packaged into  chromatin, and thus genome maintenance can be influenced by distinct chromatin  environments. In particular, post-translational modifications of histones have  emerged as key regulators of genomic integrity. Intense research during the past  few years has revealed histone H4 lysine 20 methylation (H4K20me) as critically  important for the biological processes that ensure genome integrity, such as DNA  damage repair, DNA replication and chromatin compaction. The distinct H4K20  methylation states are mediated by SET8/PR-Set7 that catalyses monomethylation  of H4K20, whereas SUV4-20H1 and SUV4-20H2 enzymes mediate further H4K20  methylation to H4K20me2 and H4K20me3. Disruption of these H4K20-specific histone  methyltransferases leads to genomic instability, demonstrating the important  functions of H4K20 methylation in genome maintenance. In this review, we explain  molecular mechanisms underlying these defects and discuss novel ideas for  furthering our understanding of genome maintenance in higher eukaryotes.', ""Nucleosome dynamics facilitated by histone turnover is required for  transcription as well as DNA replication and repair. Histone turnover is often  associated with various histone modifications such as H3K56 acetylation  (H3K56Ac), H3K36 methylation (H3K36me), and H4K20 methylation (H4K20me). In  order to correlate histone modifications and transcription-dependent histone  turnover, we performed genome wide analyses for euchromatic regions in  G2/M-arrested fission yeast. The results show that transcription-dependent  histone turnover at 5' promoter and 3' termination regions is directly  correlated with the occurrence of H3K56Ac and H4K20 mono-methylation (H4K20me1)  in actively transcribed genes. Furthermore, the increase of H3K56Ac and H4K20me1  and antisense RNA production was observed in the absence of the histone H3K36  methyltransferase Set2 and histone deacetylase complex (HDAC) that are involved  in the suppression of histone turnover within the coding regions. These results  together indicate that H4K20me1 as well as H3K56Ac are bona fide marks for  transcription-dependent histone turnover in fission yeast."", 'DNA methylation is a chemical modification of cytosine bases that is pivotal for  gene regulation, cellular specification and cancer development. Here, we  describe an R package, methylKit, that rapidly analyzes genome-wide cytosine  epigenetic profiles from high-throughput methylation and hydroxymethylation  sequencing experiments. methylKit includes functions for clustering, sample  quality visualization, differential methylation analysis and annotation  features, thus automating and simplifying many of the steps for discerning  statistically significant bases or regions of DNA methylation. Finally, we  demonstrate methylKit on breast cancer data, in which we find statistically  significant regions of differential methylation and stratify tumor subtypes.  methylKit is available at http://code.google.com/p/methylkit.', 'The transition between proliferation and quiescence is frequently associated  with changes in gene expression, extent of chromatin compaction, and histone  modifications, but whether changes in chromatin state actually regulate cell  cycle exit with quiescence is unclear. We find that primary human fibroblasts  induced into quiescence exhibit tighter chromatin compaction. Mass spectrometry  analysis of histone modifications reveals that H4K20me2 and H4K20me3 increase in  quiescence and other histone modifications are present at similar levels in  proliferating and quiescent cells. Analysis of cells in S, G2/M, and G1 phases  shows that H4K20me1 increases after S phase and is converted to H4K20me2 and  H4K20me3 in quiescence. Knockdown of the enzyme that creates H4K20me3 results in  an increased fraction of cells in S phase, a defect in exiting the cell cycle,  and decreased chromatin compaction. Overexpression of Suv4-20h1, the enzyme that  creates H4K20me2 from H4K20me1, results in G2 arrest, consistent with a role for  H4K20me1 in mitosis. The results suggest that the same lysine on H4K20 may, in  its different methylation states, facilitate mitotic functions in M phase and  promote chromatin compaction and cell cycle exit in quiescent cells.', 'The molecular biology of histone H4 lysine 20 (H4K20) methylation, like many  other post-translational modifications of histones, has been the subject of  intensive interest in recent years. While there is an emerging consensus linking  H4K20me1, H4K20me2, and H4K20me3 to transcription, repair, and constitutive  heterochromatin, respectively, the specific details of these associations and  the biological mechanisms by which the methylated histones are introduced and  function are now the subject of active investigation. Although a large number of  methylases capable of methylating H4K20 have been identified and characterized;  there is no known demethylase of H4K20, though the search is ongoing.  Additionally, many recent studies have been directed at understanding the role  of methylated H4K20 and other histone modifications associated with different  biological processes in the context of a combinatorial histone code. It seems  likely that continued study of the methylation of H4K20 will yield extremely  valuable insights concerning the regulation of histone modifications before and  during cell division and the impact of these modifications on subsequent gene  expression.', 'The methylation state of lysine 20 on histone H4 (H4K20) has been linked to  chromatin compaction, transcription, DNA repair and DNA replication.  Monomethylation of H4K20 (H4K20me1) is mediated by the cell cycle-regulated  histone methyltransferase PR-Set7. PR-Set7 depletion in mammalian cells results  in defective S phase progression and the accumulation of DNA damage, which has  been partially attributed to defects in origin selection and activation.  However, these studies were limited to only a handful of mammalian origins, and  it remains unclear how PR-Set7 and H4K20 methylation impact the replication  program on a genomic scale. We employed genetic, cytological, and genomic  approaches to better understand the role of PR-Set7 and H4K20 methylation in  regulating DNA replication and genome stability in Drosophila cells. We find  that deregulation of H4K20 methylation had no impact on origin activation  throughout the genome. Instead, depletion of PR-Set7 and loss of H4K20me1  results in the accumulation of DNA damage and an ATR-dependent cell cycle  arrest. Coincident with the ATR-dependent cell cycle arrest, we find increased  DNA damage that is specifically limited to late replicating regions of the  Drosophila genome, suggesting that PR-Set7-mediated monomethylation of H4K20 is  critical for maintaining the genomic integrity of late replicating domains.']]]","Yes, H4K20 methylation is associated with DNA replication.

Between which types of DNA bases are mutational biases introduced due to directional mutation pressure?,"[[['The prokaryotic genetic code has been influenced by directional mutation  pressure (GC/AT pressure) that has been exerted on the entire genome. This  pressure affects the synonymous codon choice, the amino acid composition of  proteins and tRNA anticodons. Unassigned codons would have been produced in  bacteria with extremely high GC or AT genomes by deleting certain codons and the  corresponding tRNAs. A high AT pressure together with genomic economization led  to a change in assignment of the UGA codon, from stop to tryptophan, in  Mycoplasma.', 'Mutation is the engine that drives evolution and adaptation forward in that it  generates the variation on which natural selection acts. Mutation is a random  process that nevertheless occurs according to certain biases. Elucidating  mutational biases and the way they vary across species and within genomes is  crucial to understanding evolution and adaptation. Here we demonstrate that  clonal pathogens that evolve under severely relaxed selection are uniquely  suitable for studying mutational biases in bacteria. We estimate mutational  patterns using sequence datasets from five such clonal pathogens belonging to  four diverse bacterial clades that span most of the range of genomic nucleotide  content. We demonstrate that across different types of sites and in all four  clades mutation is consistently biased towards AT. This is true even in clades  that have high genomic GC content. In all studied cases the mutational bias  towards AT is primarily due to the high rate of C/G to T/A transitions. These  results suggest that bacterial mutational biases are far less variable than  previously thought. They further demonstrate that variation in nucleotide  content cannot stem entirely from variation in mutational biases and that  natural selection and/or a natural selection-like process such as biased gene  conversion strongly affect nucleotide content.', 'Regions of the genome that have been the target of positive selection  specifically along the human lineage are of special importance in human biology.  We used high throughput sequencing combined with methods to enrich human genomic  samples for particular targets to obtain the sequence of 22 chromosomal samples  at high depth in 40 kb neighborhoods of 49 previously identified 100-400 bp  elements that show evidence for human accelerated evolution. In addition to  selection, the pattern of nucleotide substitutions in several of these elements  suggested an historical bias favoring the conversion of weak (A or T) alleles  into strong (G or C) alleles. Here we found strong evidence in the derived  allele frequency spectra of many of these 40 kb regions for ongoing  weak-to-strong fixation bias. Comparison of the nucleotide composition at  polymorphic loci to the composition at sites of fixed substitutions additionally  reveals the signature of historical weak-to-strong fixation bias in a subset of  these regions. Most of the regions with evidence for historical bias do not also  have signatures of ongoing bias, suggesting that the evolutionary forces  generating weak-to-strong bias are not constant over time. To investigate the  role of selection in shaping these regions, we analyzed the spatial pattern of  polymorphism in our samples. We found no significant evidence for selective  sweeps, possibly because the signal of such sweeps has decayed beyond the power  of our tests to detect them. Together, these results do not rule out functional  roles for the observed changes in these regions-indeed there is good evidence  that the first two are functional elements in humans-but they suggest that a  fixation process (such as biased gene conversion) that is biased at the  nucleotide level, but is otherwise selectively neutral, could be an important  evolutionary force at play in them, both historically and at present.', 'Using a general form of the directional mutation theory, this paper analyzes the  effect of mutations in mutator genes on the G+C content of DNA, the frequency of  substitution mutations, and evolutionary changes (cumulative mutations) under  various degrees of selective constraints. Directional mutation theory predicts  that when the mutational bias between A/T and G/C nucleotide pairs is  equilibrated with the base composition of a neutral set of DNA nucleotides, the  mutation frequency per gene will be much lower than the frequency immediately  after the mutator mutation takes place. This prediction explains the wide  variation of the DNA G+C content among unicellular organisms and possibly also  the wide intragenomic heterogeneity of third codon positions for the genes of  multicellular eukaryotes. The present analyses lead to several predictions that  are not consistent with a number of the frequently held assumptions in the field  of molecular evolution, including belief in a constant rate of evolution,  symmetric branching of phylogenetic trees, the generality of higher mutation  frequency for neutral sets of nucleotides, the notion that mutator mutations are  generally deleterious because of their high mutation rates, and teleological  explanations of DNA base composition.', 'The genome of higher eukaryotes consists of genes having a widely heterogeneous  base composition at the third codon position. Ubiquitous variability of the DNA  base composition has the following two aspects: intragenomic heterogeneity of  the G+C content and the amino-acid-specific translation-coupled biases from the  Parity Rule 2 (PR2). PR2 is an intrastrand rule where A = T and G = C are  expected if there is no bias in mutation and selection between the two  complementary strands of DNA. To examine whether or not the biases from PR2 are  responsible for the wide heterogeneity of the DNA G+C content in human, the  third codon position of 846 human genes was analyzed. Genes were separated into  six groups according to their G+C content of the third codon position, and each  group was examined for the translation-coupled PR2 biases in the nucleotide  composition of the third codon position for two- and four-codon amino acids. The  results show that genes in the different G+C content groups have similar PR2  biases, indicating that the intragenomic heterogeneity of the G+C content is not  correlated with translation-coupled biases from the PR2. Therefore, the  heterogeneity of the G+C content is likely to be determined by some other  mechanism (e.g. locally variable directional mutation pressures) than  amino-acid-specific selections for the codon preference.', 'Despite being generally under-represented in the genome, CpG sequences represent  a disproportionately high fraction of sites involved in mutational events  leading to human genetic disease. Cytosine within CpG dinucleotides is often  modified to 5-methylcytosine. Deamination of 5-methylcytosine in situ yields a  thymine, which being mispaired with guanine, is potentially mutagenic. Previous  reports have indicated that most mutations recovered at these sites appear to  originate on the non-transcribed strand as C-->T transitions. This trend may  however, reflect the lack of detectable mutant phenotypes resulting from this  transition at the complementary positions on the transcribed strand. To date,  there has not been a good model system in which mutations can be recovered on  both strands at the same CpG site. The human hprt gene has MeCpG sites contained  within arginine codons for which mutations have been recovered on both strands.  From an analysis of a database of hprt mutations, a statistically significant  strand bias is observed in mutations recovered at CpG sites. We describe some  models for the bias of mutation distribution observed at MeCpG sites in light of  this and previous work are described.', ""As a result of the nucleotide sequence analysis of an aphid endosymbiont's  operon homologous to the Escherichia coli groE, we noted that directional base  substitutions tending toward an increase of A + T content represent an obvious  evolutionary trend in this prokaryotic operon, housed for a long period by an  eukaryotic cell. This result, when taken together with previous reports, raised  the possibility that genomic DNA of prokaryotes residing in an eukaryotic cell  is subject to A/T-biased directional mutation pressure and/or both negative and  positive selection operating under conditions specific to the intracellular  environments."", 'We present a new approach for analyzing directional mutation pressure and  nucleotide content in protein-coding genes. Directional mutation pressure, the  heterogenicity in the likelihood of different nucleotide substitutions, is used  to explain the increasing or decreasing guanine-cytosine content (GC%) in DNA  and is represented by microD, in agreement with Sueoka (1962, Proc Natl Acad Sci  USA 48:582-592). The new method uses simulation to facilitate identification of  significant A+T or G+C pressure as well as the comparison of directional  mutation pressure among genes, even when they are translated by different  genetic codes. We use the method to analyze the evolution of directional  mutation pressure and nucleotide content of mitochondrial cytochrome b genes.  Results from a survey of 110 taxa indicate that the cytochrome b genes of most  taxa are subjected to significant directional mutation pressure and that the  gene is subject to A+T pressure in most cases. Only in the anseriform bird  Cairina moschata is the cytochrome b gene subject to significant G+C pressure.  The GC% at nonsynonymous codon sites decreases proportionately with increasing  A+T pressure, and with a slope less than one, indicating a presence of selective  constraints. The cytochrome b genes of insects, nematodes, and eumycotes are  subject to extreme A+T pressures (microD = 0.123, 0.224, and 0.130) and, in  parallel, the GC% of the nonsynonymous codon sites has decreased from about 0.44  in organisms that are not subjected to A+T or G+C pressure to about 0.332,  0.323, and 0.367, respectively. The distribution of taxa according to the GC% at  nonsynonymous codon sites and directional mutation pressure supports the notion  that variation in these parameters is a phylogenetic component.', 'Mutation is the engine that drives evolution and adaptation forward in that it  generates the variation on which natural selection acts.

While some evidence supports the idea  that there is a strand bias to the hypermutation mechanism, conflicting data  suggest that somatic mutations are initially acquired on both strands of DNA. In  this study, we utilized a previously defined trinucleotide target bias of  hypermutation to address the question of target strand symmetry during mutation.  Mutabilities of specific base positions within all triplets were compared  between the two strands of DNA in three divergent databases of hypermutated  sequences. Unexpectedly, we consistently observed strong correlations between  mutabilities of triplet positions on the two DNA strands only for G and T in the  first position of a triplet or for C and A in the last position. The most  straightforward interpretation of this result is that the mutation mechanism  targets either G and T or C and A on both strands of DNA with a frequency that  depends upon the adjacent dinucleotide sequence. In view of published evidence  that C is targeted by the hypermutation mechanism, we can extrapolate that C and  A are specifically targeted at a frequency that depends upon the preceding 5'  dinucleotide.""]]]","Mutational biases due to directional mutation pressure are introduced between C and A, and G and T.

Which genes are associated with autosomal dominant Charcot-Marie-Tooth?,"[[['BACKGROUND: Recently, mutations affecting different domains of dynamin-2 (DNM2)  were associated alternatively with autosomal dominant centronuclear myopathy or  dominant intermediate (demyelinating and axonal) Charcot-Marie-Tooth disease  (CMT) type B. OBJECTIVE: To assess the etiologic role of DNM2 in CMT. METHODS: We performed a mutational screening of DNM2 exons 13 through 16  encoding the pleckstrin homology domain in a large series of CMT patients with a  broad range of nerve conduction velocities and without mutations in more common  genes. RESULTS: We identified two novel DNM2 mutations that cosegregated with purely  axonal CMT in two pedigrees without clinical evidence of primary myopathy. CONCLUSION: Patients with axonal Charcot-Marie-Tooth disease type 2 neuropathy  without mutations in more common genes should undergo investigation for DNM2  pleckstrin homology.', 'BACKGROUND: Charcot-Marie-Tooth (CMT) neuropathy is a heterogeneous group of  inherited disorders of the peripheral nervous system. The authors recently  mapped an autosomal dominant demyelinating form of CMT type 1 (CMT1C) to  chromosome 16p13.1-p12.3. OBJECTIVE: To find the gene mutations underlying CMT1C. METHODS: The authors used a combination of standard positional cloning and  candidate gene approaches to identify the causal gene for CMT1C. Western blot  analysis was used to determine relative protein levels in patient and control  lymphocyte extracts. Northern blotting was used to characterize gene expression  in 1) multiple tissues; 2) developing sciatic nerve; and 3) nerve-crush and  nerve-transection experiments. RESULTS: The authors identified missense mutations (G112S, T115N, W116G) in the  LITAFgene (lipopolysaccharide-induced tumor necrosis factor-alpha factor) in  three CMT1C pedigrees. LITAF, which is also referred to as SIMPLE, is a widely  expressed gene encoding a 161-amino acid protein that may play a role in protein  degradation pathways. The mutations associated with CMT1C were found to cluster,  defining a domain of the LITAF protein having a critical role in peripheral  nerve function. Western blot analysis suggested that the T115N and W116G  mutations do not alter the level of LITAF protein in peripheral blood  lymphocytes. The LITAF transcript is expressed in sciatic nerve, but its level  of expression is not altered during development or in response to nerve injury.  This finding is in stark contrast to that seen for other known genes that cause  CMT1. CONCLUSIONS: Mutations in LITAF may account for a significant proportion of CMT1  patients with previously unknown molecular diagnosis and may define a new  mechanism of peripheral nerve perturbation leading to demyelinating neuropathy.', 'BACKGROUND: The first locus for demyelinating autosomal recessive  Charcot-Marie-Tooth (ARCMT) disease was identified in 8q13, where mutations in  GDAP1 have been found. Mutations in the same gene have been detected in families  with axonal ARCMT disease. OBJECTIVE: To determine the clinical, electrophysiologic, and morphologic  characteristics of a consanguineous Moroccan family with ARCMT disease  associated with the S194X mutation in the GDAP1 gene. METHODS: Four patients from a consanguineous Moroccan family were examined  clinically and electrophysiologically. In one patient, a morphometric and  ultrastructural study of a peroneal nerve biopsy sample was performed. Mutation  in the coding region of the GDAP1 gene was identified by direct sequencing. RESULTS: Neuropathy was evident early in childhood, walking was delayed in one  patient, and onset of symptoms occurred before 18 months in the others. The  phenotype was severe: foot deformities and disabilities involving the hands and  feet developed toward the end of the first decade, followed by involvement of  proximal muscles in the lower limbs, leading to loss of autonomy.  Electrophysiologic findings were consistent with an axonal form of CMT disease:  motor nerve conduction velocities, recordable in one patient only, were greater  than 40 m/sec. Sensory nerve action potentials were either abolished or  substantially reduced in amplitude. The morphologic data supported the diagnosis  of axonal neuropathy, showing a marked reduction in myelinated fibers and signs  of axonal regeneration, including frequent pseudo-onion bulb formations. The 4  patients in this family were homozygous for the S194X mutation in the GDAP1  gene. CONCLUSION: Electrophysiologic and pathological findings support the hypothesis  of an axonal disorder in this ARCMT family with the S194X mutation in the GDAP1  gene.', ""The objective of this study is to assess the genetic distribution of  Charcot-Marie-Tooth (CMT) disease in Campania, a region of Southern Italy. We  analyzed a cohort of 197 index cases and reported the type and frequency of  mutations for the whole CMT population and for each electrophysiological group  (CMT1, CMT2, and hereditary neuropathy with susceptibility to pressure palsies  [HNPP]) and for familial and isolated CMT cases. Genetic diagnosis was achieved  in 148 patients (75.1%) with a higher success rate in HNPP and CMT1 than CMT2.  Only four genes (PMP22, GJB1, MPZ, and GDAP1) accounted for 92% of all  genetically confirmed CMT cases. In CMT1, PMP22 duplication was the most common  mutation while the second gene in order of frequency was MPZ in familial and  SH3TC2 in isolated cases. In CMT2, GJB1 was the most frequent mutated gene and  GJB1 with GDAP1 accounted for almost 3/4 of genetically defined CMT2 patients.  The first gene in order of frequency was GJB1 in familial and GDAP1 in isolated  cases. In HNPP, the majority of patients harbored the PMP22 gene deletion. The  novelty of our data is the relatively high frequency of SH3TC2 and GDAP1  mutations in demyelinating and axonal forms, respectively. These epidemiological  data can help in panel design for our patients' population."", 'Autosomal dominant Charcot-Marie-Tooth type-1A neuropathy (CMT1A) is a  demyelinating peripheral nerve disorder that is commonly associated with a  submicroscopic tandem DNA duplication of a 1.5-Mb region of 17p11.2p12 that  contains the peripheral myelin gene PMP22. Clinical features of CMT1A include  progressive distal muscle atrophy and weakness, foot and hand deformities, gait  abnormalities, absent reflexes, and the completely penetrant electrophysiologic  phenotype of symmetric reductions in motor nerve conduction velocities (NCVs).  Molecular and fluorescense in situ hybridization (FISH) analyses were performed  to determine the duplication status of the PMP22 gene in four patients with rare  cytogenetic duplications of 17p. Neuropathologic features of CMT1A were seen in  two of these four patients, in addition to the complex phenotype asociated with  17p partial trisomy. Our findings show that the CMT1A phenotype of reduced NCV  is specifically associated with PMP22 gene duplications, thus providing further  support for the PMP22 gene dosage mechanism for CMT1A.', 'Charcot-Marie-Tooth (CMT) disease caused by mutations in the GDAP1 gene has been  shown to be inherited via traits that may be either autosomal recessive (in the  majority of cases) [CMT4A] or autosomal dominant [CMT2K]. CMT4A disease is  characterized by an early onset, and a severe clinical course often leading to a  loss of ambulation, whereas CMT2K is characterized by a mild clinical course of  benign axonal neuropathy beginning even in the 6th decade of life. Clinical data  from a GDAP1 mutated patient suggests that the presence of a particular mutation  is associated with a certain trait of inheritance. The association of a  particular GDAP1 gene mutation and a dominant or recessive trait of inheritance  is of special importance for genetic counseling and the prenatal diagnostics as  regards severe forms of CMT. In the present study we report on two CMT families  in which a newly identified Glu222Lys mutation within the GDAP1 gene segregates  both in autosomal dominant and recessive traits. Our study shows that at least  some GDAP1 gene mutations may segregate with the CMT phenotype as both dominant  and recessive traits. Thus, genetic counseling for CMT4A/CMT2K families requires  more extensive data on GDAP1 phenotype-genotype correlations.', 'Dominant intermediate Charcot-Marie-Tooth neuropathy type B is caused by  mutations in dynamin 2. We studied the clinical, haematological,  electrophysiological and sural nerve biopsy findings in 34 patients belonging to  six unrelated dominant intermediate Charcot-Marie-Tooth neuropathy type B  families in whom a dynamin 2 mutation had been identified: Gly358Arg (Spain);  Asp551_Glu553del; Lys550fs (North America); Lys558del (Belgium); Lys558Glu  (Australia, the Netherlands) and Thr855_Ile856del (Belgium). The Gly358Arg and  Thr855_Ile856del mutations were novel, and in contrast to the other  Charcot-Marie-Tooth-related mutations in dynamin 2, which are all located in the  pleckstrin homology domain, they were situated in the middle domain and  proline-rich domain of dynamin 2, respectively. We report the first  disease-causing mutation in the proline-rich domain of dynamin 2. Patients with  a dynamin 2 mutation presented with a classical Charcot-Marie-Tooth phenotype,  which was mild to moderately severe since only 3% of the patients were  wheelchair-bound. The mean age at onset was 16 years with a large variability  ranging from 2 to 50 years. Interestingly, in the Australian and Belgian  families, which carry two different mutations affecting the same amino acid  (Lys558), Charcot-Marie-Tooth cosegregated with neutropaenia. In addition, early  onset cataracts were observed in one of the Charcot-Marie-Tooth families. Our  electrophysiological data indicate intermediate or axonal motor median nerve  conduction velocities (NCV) ranging from 26 m/s to normal values in four  families, and less pronounced reduction of motor median NCV (41-46 m/s) with  normal amplitudes in two families. Sural nerve biopsy in a Dutch patient with  Lys558Glu mutation showed diffuse loss of large myelinated fibres, presence of  many clusters of regenerating myelinated axons and fibres with focal myelin  thickenings--findings very similar to those previously reported in the  Australian family. We conclude that dynamin 2 mutations should be screened in  the autosomal dominant Charcot-Marie-Tooth neuropathy families with intermediate  or axonal NCV, and in patients with a classical mild to moderately severe  Charcot-Marie-Tooth phenotype, especially when Charcot-Marie-Tooth is associated  with neutropaenia or cataracts.', 'Neurofilament light chain polypeptide (NEFL) is one of the most abundant  cytoskeletal components of the neuron. Mutations in the NEFL gene were recently  reported as a cause for autosomal dominant Charcot-Marie-Tooth type 2E (CMT2E)  linked to chromosome 8p21. In order to investigate the frequency and phenotypic  consequences of NEFL mutations, we screened 323 patients with CMT or related  peripheral neuropathies. We detected six disease associated missense mutations  and one 3-bp in-frame deletion clustered in functionally defined domains of the  NEFL protein. Patients have an early onset and often a severe clinical  phenotype. Electrophysiological examination shows moderately to severely slowed  nerve conduction velocities. We report the first nerve biopsy of a CMT patient  with a de novo missense mutation in NEFL, and found an axonal pathology with  axonal regeneration clusters and onion bulb formations. Our findings provide  further evidence that the clinical variation observed in CMT depends on the gene  mutated and the specific type of mutation, and we also suggest that NEFL  mutations need to be considered in the molecular evaluation of patients with  sporadic or dominantly inherited CMT.', 'Mutations in the ganglioside-induced-differentiation-associated protein 1 gene  (GDAP1) can cause Charcot-Marie-Tooth (CMT) disease with demyelinating (CMT4A)  or axonal forms (CMT2K and ARCMT2K). Most of these mutations present a recessive  inheritance, but few autosomal dominant GDAP1 mutations have also been reported.  We performed a GDAP1 gene screening in a clinically well-characterized series of  81 index cases with axonal CMT neuropathy, identifying 17 patients belonging to  4 unrelated families in whom the heterozygous p.R120W was found to be the only  disease-causing mutation. The main objective was to fully characterize the  neuropathy caused by this mutation. The clinical picture included a  mild-moderate phenotype with onset around adolescence, but great variability.  Consistently, ankle dorsiflexion and plantar flexion were impaired to a similar  degree. Nerve conduction studies revealed an axonal neuropathy. Muscle magnetic  resonance imaging studies demonstrated selective involvement of intrinsic foot  muscles in all patients and a uniform pattern of fatty infiltration in the calf,  with distal and superficial posterior predominance. Pathological abnormalities  included depletion of myelinated fibers, regenerative clusters and features of  axonal degeneration with mitochondrial aggregates. Our findings highlight the  relevance of dominantly transmitted p.R120W GDAP1 gene mutations which can cause  an axonal CMT with a wide clinical profile.', 'Charcot-Marie-Tooth (CMT) diseases include a group of clinically heterogeneous  inherited neuropathies subdivided into demyelinating (CMT1), axonal (CMT2) and  intermediate CMT forms. CMTs are associated with different genes, although  mutations in some of these genes may cause both clinical pictures. To date, more  than 50 CMT genes have been identified, but more than half of the cases are due  to mutations in MFN2, MPZ, GJB1 and PMP22. The aim of this study was to estimate  the frequency of disease mutations\xa0of these four genes in the axonal form of CMT  in order to evaluate their effectiveness in the molecular diagnosis of CMT2  patients. A cohort of 38 CMT2 Italian subjects was screened for mutations in the  MFN2, MPZ and GJB1 genes by direct sequencing and for PMP22 rearrangements using  the MLPA technique. Overall, we identified 15 mutations, 8 of which were novel:  11 mutations (28.9\xa0%) were in the MFN2 gene, 2 (5.3\xa0%) in MPZ and 2 (5.3\xa0%) in  PMP22. No mutations were found in GJB1. Two patients showed rearrangements in  the PMP22 gene, which is commonly associated with CMT1 or HNPP phenotypes thus  usually not tested in CMT2 patients. By including this gene in the analysis, we  reached a molecular diagnosis rate of 39.5\xa0%, which is one of the highest  reported in the literature. Our findings confirm the MFN2 gene as the most  common cause of CMT2 and suggest that PMP22 rearrangements should be considered  in the molecular diagnosis of CMT2 patients.']]]",Dynamin-2 (DNM2) is associated with autosomal dominant intermediate Charcot-Marie-Tooth neuropathy type B.

List components of the CRSP/Med complex.,"[[['Activation of gene transcription in metazoans is a multistep process that is  triggered by factors that recognize transcriptional enhancer sites in DNA. These  factors work with co-activators to direct transcriptional initiation by the RNA  polymerase II apparatus. One class of co-activator, the TAF(II) subunits of  transcription factor TFIID, can serve as targets of activators and as proteins  that recognize core promoter sequences necessary for transcription initiation.  Transcriptional activation by enhancer-binding factors such as Sp1 requires  TFIID, but the identity of other necessary cofactors has remained unknown. Here  we describe a new human factor, CRSP, that is required together with the  TAF(II)s for transcriptional activation by Sp1. Purification of CRSP identifies  a complex of approximate relative molecular mass 700,000 (M(r) approximately  700K) that contains nine subunits with M(r) values ranging from 33K to 200K.  Cloning of genes encoding CRSP subunits reveals that CRSP33 is a homologue of  the yeast mediator subunit Med7, whereas CRSP150 contains a domain conserved in  yeast mediator subunit Rgr1. CRSP p200 is identical to the nuclear  hormone-receptor co-activator subunit TRIP2/PBP. CRSPs 34, 77 and 130 are new  proteins, but the amino terminus of CRSP70 is homologous to elongation factor  TFIIS. Immunodepletion studies confirm that these subunits have an essential  cofactor function.

Electronic  address: erez@erez.com.', 'Human MED26 was originally purified in the cofactor required for the Sp1  activation complex (CRSP) as a 70-kDa component named CRSP70. This polypeptide  was specific to metazoans and the “small” form of the Mediator complex. We  report here that a Drosophila melanogaster homologue of MED26 similarly  interacts with other components of the core Drosophila Mediator complex but not  with the kinase module and is recruited to genes upon activation. Using a null  allele of Med26, we show that Med26 is required for organismal viability but not  for cell proliferation or survival. Clones lacking Med26 in the wing disc lead  to loss of the adult wing margin and reduced expression of genes involved in  wing margin formation. Surprisingly, when polytene chromosomes from the salivary  gland were examined using antibodies to Med26, it was apparent that a fraction  of the protein was associated with the chromocenter, which contains pericentric  heterochromatin. This staining colocalizes with heterochromatin protein 1 (HP1).  Immunoprecipitation experiments show that Med26 interacts with HP1. The  interaction is mediated through the chromoshadow domain of HP1 and through the  conserved motif in the carboxy terminus of the Med26 protein. This work is the  first characterization of the metazoan-specific Mediator subunit in an animal  model.', 'Activation of gene transcription in mammalian cells requires several classes of  coactivators that participate in different steps of the activation cascade.  Using conventional and affinity chromatography, we have isolated a human  coactivator complex that interacts directly with the C-terminal domain (CTD) of  RNA polymerase II (Pol II). The CTD-binding complex is structurally and  functionally indistinguishable from our previously isolated CRSP coactivator  complex. The closely related, but transcriptionally inactive, ARC-L complex  failed to interact with the CTD, indicating a significant biochemical difference  between CRSP and ARC-L that may, in part, explain their functional divergence.  Electron microscopy and three-dimensional single-particle reconstruction reveals  a conformation for CTD-CRSP that is structurally distinct from unliganded CRSP  or CRSP bound to SREBP-1a, but highly similar to CRSP bound to the VP16  activator. Together, our findings suggest that the human CRSP coactivator  functions, at least in part, by mediating activator-dependent recruitment of RNA  Pol II via the CTD.', 'Author information: (1)Temasek Lifesciences Laboratory, 1 Research Link, National University of  Singapore, 117604 Singapore, Singapore; Department of Biological Sciences,  National University of Singapore, 14 Science Drive 4, 117543 Singapore,  Singapore.

C/EBPbeta acts as a repressor that is turned into an activator by the Ras  oncoprotein through phosphorylation of a MAPK site. C/EBPbeta activation is  accompanied by a conformational change. Active and repressive C/EBPbeta  interacts with multisubunit Mediator complexes through the CRSP130/Sur2 subunit.  The CRSP130/Sur2 subunit is common to two distinct types of Mediator complexes,  characterized by CRSP70 and CDK8 proteins as transcriptionally active and  inactive Mediator, respectively. Knockdown of CRSP130/Sur2 prevents Mediator  binding and transactivation through C/EBPbeta. Oncogenic Ras signaling or  activating mutations in C/EBPbeta selects the transcriptionally active Mediator  complex that also associates with RNA polymerase II. These results show that a  Ras-induced structural alteration of C/EBPbeta determines differential gene  activation through selective interaction with distinct Mediator complexes.', ""FANTOM Consortium and the RIKEN PMI and CLST (DGT); Forrest AR, Kawaji H, Rehli  M, Baillie JK, de Hoon MJ, Haberle V, Lassmann T, Kulakovskiy IV, Lizio M, Itoh  M, Andersson R, Mungall CJ, Meehan TF, Schmeier S, Bertin N, Jørgensen M, Dimont  E, Arner E, Schmidl C, Schaefer U, Medvedeva YA, Plessy C, Vitezic M, Severin J,  Semple C, Ishizu Y, Young RS, Francescatto M, Alam I, Albanese D, Altschuler GM,  Arakawa T, Archer JA, Arner P, Babina M, Rennie S, Balwierz PJ, Beckhouse AG,  Pradhan-Bhatt S, Blake JA, Blumenthal A, Bodega B, Bonetti A, Briggs J,  Brombacher F, Burroughs AM, Califano A, Cannistraci CV, Carbajo D, Chen Y,  Chierici M, Ciani Y, Clevers HC, Dalla E, Davis CA, Detmar M, Diehl AD, Dohi T,  Drabløs F, Edge AS, Edinger M, Ekwall K, Endoh M, Enomoto H, Fagiolini M,  Fairbairn L, Fang H, Farach-Carson MC, Faulkner GJ, Favorov AV, Fisher ME, Frith  MC, Fujita R, Fukuda S, Furlanello C, Furino M, Furusawa J, Geijtenbeek TB,  Gibson AP, Gingeras T, Goldowitz D, Gough J, Guhl S, Guler R, Gustincich S, Ha  TJ, Hamaguchi M, Hara M, Harbers M, Harshbarger J, Hasegawa A, Hasegawa Y,  Hashimoto T, Herlyn M, Hitchens KJ, Ho Sui SJ, Hofmann OM, Hoof I, Hori F,  Huminiecki L, Iida K, Ikawa T, Jankovic BR, Jia H, Joshi A, Jurman G, Kaczkowski  B, Kai C, Kaida K, Kaiho A, Kajiyama K, Kanamori-Katayama M, Kasianov AS,  Kasukawa T, Katayama S, Kato S, Kawaguchi S, Kawamoto H, Kawamura YI, Kawashima  T, Kempfle JS, Kenna TJ, Kere J, Khachigian LM, Kitamura T, Klinken SP, Knox AJ,  Kojima M, Kojima S, Kondo N, Koseki H, Koyasu S, Krampitz S, Kubosaki A, Kwon  AT, Laros JF, Lee W, Lennartsson A, Li K, Lilje B, Lipovich L, Mackay-Sim A,  Manabe R, Mar JC, Marchand B, Mathelier A, Mejhert N, Meynert A, Mizuno Y, de  Lima Morais DA, Morikawa H, Morimoto M, Moro K, Motakis E, Motohashi H, Mummery  CL, Murata M, Nagao-Sato S, Nakachi Y, Nakahara F, Nakamura T, Nakamura Y,  Nakazato K, van Nimwegen E, Ninomiya N, Nishiyori H, Noma S, Noma S, Noazaki T,  Ogishima S, Ohkura N, Ohimiya H, Ohno H, Ohshima M, Okada-Hatakeyama M, Okazaki  Y, Orlando V, Ovchinnikov DA, Pain A, Passier R, Patrikakis M, Persson H, Piazza  S, Prendergast JG, Rackham OJ, Ramilowski JA, Rashid M, Ravasi T, Rizzu P,  Roncador M, Roy S, Rye MB, Saijyo E, Sajantila A, Saka A, Sakaguchi S, Sakai M,  Sato H, Savvi S, Saxena A, Schneider C, Schultes EA, Schulze-Tanzil GG,  Schwegmann A, Sengstag T, Sheng G, Shimoji H, Shimoni Y, Shin JW, Simon C,  Sugiyama D, Sugiyama T, Suzuki M, Suzuki N, Swoboda RK, 't Hoen PA, Tagami M,  Takahashi N, Takai J, Tanaka H, Tatsukawa H, Tatum Z, Thompson M, Toyodo H,  Toyoda T, Valen E, van de Wetering M, van den Berg LM, Verado R, Vijayan D,  Vorontsov IE, Wasserman WW, Watanabe S, Wells CA, Winteringham LN, Wolvetang E,  Wood EJ, Yamaguchi Y, Yamamoto M, Yoneda M, Yonekura Y, Yoshida S, Zabierowski  SE, Zhang PG, Zhao X, Zucchelli S, Summers KM, Suzuki H, Daub CO, Kawai J,  Heutink P, Hide W, Freeman TC, Lenhard B, Bajic VB, Taylor MS, Makeev VJ,  Sandelin A, Hume DA, Carninci P, Hayashizaki Y."", 'Author information: (1)Joint Laboratory for Structural Biology of Infection and Inflammation,  Institute of Biochemistry and Molecular Biology, University of Hamburg, and  Institute of Biochemistry, University of Lübeck, at Deutsches  Elektronen-Synchrotron (DESY), Notkestrasse 85, 22607 Hamburg, Germany.

(#)Contributed equally', 'Transcription of protein coding genes in metazoans involves the concerted action  of enhancer binding proteins and the RNA polymerase II apparatus. The cross talk  between these two classes of transcription factors is mediated by an elaborate  set of cofactor complexes. For the activation of transcription by the promoter  specificity protein 1 (Sp1), TATA binding protein-associated factors in the  TFIID complex originally were identified as necessary coactivators, but the  identity of additional cofactors required for activated transcription was  unknown. Recently, we have reported the isolation and properties of a cofactor  complex, CRSP (cofactor required for Sp1), which functions in conjunction with  the TATA binding protein-associated factors to promote efficient activation of  transcription by Sp1. CRSP contains unique subunits as well as polypeptides that  are shared with other cofactor complexes. Here, we report a detailed  purification protocol for the isolation of CRSP from human HeLa cells. Our  purification strategy takes advantage of the ability of CRSP to bind  Ni2+-nitrilotriacetic acid-agarose resin as well as other conventional  chromatographic resins. We also describe a streamlined purification protocol  that allows a more rapid and efficient means to isolate active CRSP.']]]","Based on the provided context, the key components of the CRSP/Med complex include:

For the constructions of which organs has 3D printing been tested?,"[[['Cardiovascular diseases are the leading cause of deaths throughout the world.  Vascular diseases are mostly treated with autografts and blood vessel  transplantations. However, traditional grafting methods have several problems  including lack of suitable harvest sites, additional surgical costs for  harvesting procedure, pain, infection, lack of donors, and even no substitutes  at all. Recently, tissue engineering and regenerative medicine approaches are  used to regenerate damaged or diseased tissues. Most of the tissue engineering  investigations have been based on the cell seeding into scaffolds by providing a  suitable environment for cell attachment, proliferation, and differentiation.  Because of the challenges such as difficulties in seeding cells spatially,  rejection, and inflammation of biomaterials used, the recent tissue engineering  studies focus on scaffold-free techniques. In this paper, the development of  novel computer aided algorithms and methods are developed for 3D bioprinting of  scaffold-free biomimetic macrovascular structures. Computer model mimicking a  real human aorta is generated using imaging techniques and the proposed  computational algorithms. An optimized three-dimensional bioprinting path  planning are developed with the proposed self-supported model. Mouse embryonic  fibroblast (MEF) cell aggregates and support structures (hydrogels) are 3D  bioprinted layer-by-layer according to the proposed self-supported method to  form an aortic tissue construct.', 'An additive manufacturing process that combines digital modeling and 3D printing  was used to prepare fiber reinforced hydrogels in a single-step process. The  composite materials were fabricated by selectively pattering a combination of  alginate/acrylamide gel precursor solution and an epoxy based UV-curable  adhesive (Emax 904 Gel-SC) with an extrusion printer. UV irradiation was used to  cure the two inks into a single composite material. Spatial control of fiber  distribution within the digital models allowed for the fabrication of a series  of materials with a spectrum of swelling behavior and mechanical properties with  physical characteristics ranging from soft and wet to hard and dry. A comparison  with the ""rule of mixtures"" was used to show that the swollen composite  materials adhere to standard composite theory. A prototype meniscus cartilage  was prepared to illustrate the potential application in bioengineering.', 'The morphology and the functionality of the murid glandular complex, composed of  the submandibular and sublingual salivary glands (SSC), were the object of  several studies conducted mainly using magnetic resonance imaging (MRI). Using a  4.7 T scanner and a manganese-based contrast agent, we improved the  signal-to-noise ratio of the SSC relating to the surrounding anatomical  structures allowing to obtain high-contrast 3D images of the SSC. In the last  few years, the large development in resin melting techniques opened the way for  printing 3D objects starting from a 3D stack of images. Here, we demonstrate the  feasibility of the 3D printing technique of soft tissues such as the SSC in the  rat with the aim to improve the visualization of the organs. This approach is  useful to preserve the real in vivo morphology of the SCC in living animals  avoiding the anatomical shape changes due to the lack of relationships with the  surrounding organs in case of extraction. It is also harmless, repeatable and  can be applied to explore volumetric changes occurring during body growth,  excretory duct obstruction, tumorigenesis and regeneration processes. 3D  printing allows to obtain a solid object with the same shape of the organ of  interest, which can be observed, freely rotated and manipulated. To increase the  visibility of the details, it is possible to print the organs with a selected  zoom factor, useful as in case of tiny organs in small mammalia. An immediate  application of this technique is represented by educational classes.', '3D printing is a method of manufacturing in which materials, such as plastic or  metal, are deposited onto one another in layers to produce a three dimensional  object, such as a pair of eye glasses or other 3D objects. This process  contrasts with traditional ink-based printers which produce a two dimensional  object (ink on paper). To date, 3D printing has primarily been used in  engineering to create engineering prototypes. However, recent advances in  printing materials have now enabled 3D printers to make objects that are  comparable with traditionally manufactured items. In contrast with conventional  printers, 3D printing has the potential to enable mass customisation of goods on  a large scale and has relevance in medicine including ophthalmology. 3D printing  has already been proved viable in several medical applications including the  manufacture of eyeglasses, custom prosthetic devices and dental implants. In  this review, we discuss the potential for 3D printing to revolutionise  manufacturing in the same way as the printing press revolutionised conventional  printing. The applications and limitations of 3D printing are discussed; the  production process is demonstrated by producing a set of eyeglass frames from 3D  blueprints.', 'The three-dimensional (3D) printer is a new technology that creates physical  objects from digital files. Recent technological advances in 3D printing have  resulted in increased use of this technology in the medical field, where it is  beginning to revolutionize medical and surgical possibilities. It is already  providing medicine with powerful tools that facilitate education, surgical  planning, and organ transplantation research. A good understanding of this  technology will be beneficial to ophthalmologists. The potential applications of  3D printing in ophthalmology, both current and future, are explored in this  article.', 'A multimaterial bio-ink method using polyethylene glycol crosslinking is  presented for expanding the biomaterial palette required for 3D bioprinting of  more mimetic and customizable tissue and organ constructs. Lightly crosslinked,  soft hydrogels are produced from precursor solutions of various materials and 3D  printed. Rheological and biological characterizations are presented, and the  promise of this new bio-ink synthesis strategy is discussed.', 'In the world, bone tuberculosis is still very difficult to treat and presents a  challenge to clinicians. In this study, we utilized 3D printing technology to  fabricate a programmed release multi-drug implant for bone tuberculosis therapy.  The construction of the drug implant was a multi-layered concentric cylinder  divided into four layers from the center to the periphery. Isoniazid and  rifampicin were distributed individually into the different layers in a specific  sequence of isoniazid-rifampicin-isoniazid-rifampicin. The drug release assays  in vitro and in vivo showed that isoniazid and rifampicin were released orderly  from the outside to the center to form the multi-drug therapeutic alliance, and  the peak concentrations of drugs were detected in sequence at 8 to 12 day  intervals. In addition, no negative effect on the proliferation of rabbit bone  marrow mesenchymal stem cells was detected during the cytocompatibility assay.  Due to its ideal pharmacologic action and cytocompatibility, the programmed  release multi-drug implant with a complex construction fabricated by 3D printing  technology could be of interest in prevention and treatment of bone  tuberculosis.', 'Three-dimensional (3D) bioprinting, a flexible automated on-demand platform for  the free-form fabrication of complex living architectures, is a novel approach  for the design and engineering of human organs and tissues. Here, we demonstrate  the potential of 3D bioprinting for tissue engineering using human skin as a  prototypical example. Keratinocytes and fibroblasts were used as constituent  cells to represent the epidermis and dermis, and collagen was used to represent  the dermal matrix of the skin. Preliminary studies were conducted to optimize  printing parameters for maximum cell viability as well as for the optimization  of cell densities in the epidermis and dermis to mimic physiologically relevant  attributes of human skin. Printed 3D constructs were cultured in submerged media  conditions followed by exposure of the epidermal layer to the air-liquid  interface to promote maturation and stratification. Histology and  immunofluorescence characterization demonstrated that 3D printed skin tissue was  morphologically and biologically representative of in vivo human skin tissue. In  comparison with traditional methods for skin engineering, 3D bioprinting offers  several advantages in terms of shape- and form retention, flexibility,  reproducibility, and high culture throughput. It has a broad range of  applications in transdermal and topical formulation discovery, dermal toxicity  studies, and in designing autologous grafts for wound healing. The  proof-of-concept studies presented here can be further extended for enhancing  the complexity of the skin model via the incorporation of secondary and adnexal  structures or the inclusion of diseased cells to serve as a model for studying  the pathophysiology of skin diseases.', 'Tissue engineering technology promises to solve the organ transplantation  crisis. However, assembly of vascularized 3D soft organs remains a big  challenge. Organ printing, which we define as computer-aided, jet-based 3D  tissue-engineering of living human organs, offers a possible solution. Organ  printing involves three sequential steps: pre-processing or development of  ""blueprints"" for organs; processing or actual organ printing; and postprocessing  or organ conditioning and accelerated organ maturation. A cell printer that can  print gels, single cells and cell aggregates has been developed. Layer-by-layer  sequentially placed and solidified thin layers of a thermo-reversible gel could  serve as ""printing paper"". Combination of an engineering approach with the  developmental biology concept of embryonic tissue fluidity enables the creation  of a new rapid prototyping 3D organ printing technology, which will dramatically  accelerate and optimize tissue and organ assembly.', 'Tissue engineering has great potential to provide a functional de novo living  valve replacement, capable of integration with host tissue and growth. Among  various valve conduit fabrication techniques, three-dimensional (3-D)  bioprinting enables deposition of cells and hydrogels into 3-D constructs with  anatomical geometry and heterogeneous mechanical properties. Successful  translation of this approach, however, is constrained by the dearth of printable  and biocompatible hydrogel materials. Furthermore, it is not known how human  valve cells respond to these printed environments. In this study, 3-D printable  formulations of hybrid hydrogels are developed, based on methacrylated  hyaluronic acid (Me-HA) and methacrylated gelatin (Me-Gel), and used to bioprint  heart valve conduits containing encapsulated human aortic valvular interstitial  cells (HAVIC). Increasing Me-Gel concentration resulted in lower stiffness and  higher viscosity, facilitated cell spreading, and better maintained HAVIC  fibroblastic phenotype. Bioprinting accuracy was dependent upon the relative  concentrations of Me-Gel and Me-HA, but when optimized enabled the fabrication  of a trileaflet valve shape accurate to the original design. HAVIC encapsulated  within bioprinted heart valves maintained high viability, and remodeled the  initial matrix by depositing collagen and glyosaminoglycans. These findings  represent the first rational design of bioprinted trileaflet valve hydrogels  that regulate encapsulated human VIC behavior. The use of anatomically accurate  living valve scaffolds through bioprinting may accelerate understanding of  physiological valve cell interactions and progress towards de novo living valve  replacements.']]]",3D printing has been tested for the construction of human skin and heart valve conduits.,"[{'Exact': array([ 1.39606986,  0.84196472, -2.00889626,  3.65458487,  1.49600152,

Which gene is the paralog of yeast UPC2?,"[[[""Gene redundancy has been observed in yeast, plant and human genomes, and is  thought to be a consequence of whole-genome duplications. Baker's yeast,  Saccharomyces cerevisiae, contains several hundred duplicated genes.  Duplication(s) could have occurred before or after a given speciation. To  understand the evolution of the yeast genome, we analysed orthologues of some of  these genes in several related yeast species. On the basis of the inferred  phylogeny of each set of genes, we were able to deduce whether the gene  duplicated and/or specialized before or after the divergence of two yeast  lineages. Here we show that the gene duplications might have occurred as a  single event, and that it probably took place before the Saccharomyces and  Kluyveromyces lineages diverged from each other. Further evolution of each  duplicated gene pair-such as specialization or differentiation of the two  copies, or deletion of a single copy--has taken place independently throughout  the evolution of these species."", 'In addition to their well-documented roles in the promotion of nonsense-mediated  mRNA decay (NMD), yeast Upf proteins (Upf1, Upf2/Nmd2, and Upf3) also manifest  translational regulatory functions, at least in vitro, including roles in  premature translation termination and subsequent reinitiation. Here, we find  that all upf Delta strains also fail to reinitiate translation after  encountering a premature termination codon (PTC) in vivo, a result that led us  to seek a unifying mechanism for all of these translation phenomena. Comparisons  of the in vitro translational activities of wild-type (WT) and upf1 Delta  extracts were utilized to test for a Upf1 role in post-termination ribosome  reutilization. Relative to WT extracts, non-nucleased extracts lacking Upf1 had  approximately twofold decreased activity for the translation of synthetic  CAN1/LUC mRNA, a defect paralleled by fewer ribosomes per mRNA and reduced  efficiency of the 60S joining step at initiation. These deficiencies could be  complemented by purified FLAG-Upf1, or 60S subunits, and appeared to reflect  diminished cycling of ribosomes from endogenous PTC-containing mRNAs to  exogenously added synthetic mRNA in the same extracts. This hypothesis was  tested, and supported, by experiments in which nucleased WT or upf1 Delta  extracts were first challenged with high concentrations of synthetic mRNAs that  were templates for either normal or premature translation termination and then  assayed for their capacity to translate a normal mRNA. Our results indicate that  Upf1 plays a key role in a mechanism coupling termination and ribosome release  at a PTC to subsequent ribosome reutilization for another round of translation  initiation.', 'Wild-type yeast cells are unable to take up sterols from their growth media  under aerobic conditions and are relatively resistant to monovalent cations. A  yeast mutant (upc2-1) with a defect in the aerobic exclusion of sterols was  found to have increased sensitivity to LiCl and NaCl. Although cation  sensitivity has been reported for mutants that synthesize altered sterols, the  mutant with upc2-1 continues to produce the normal sterol, ergosterol. The ENA2  gene was cloned on the basis of remediating the hypersensitivity to the  monovalent cations.', 'Zinc cluster proteins are a large family of transcriptional regulators with a  wide range of biological functions. The zinc cluster proteins Ecm22, Upc2, Sut1  and Sut2 have initially been identified as regulators of sterol import in the  budding yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae. These proteins also control adaptations  to anaerobic growth, sterol biosynthesis as well as filamentation and mating.  Orthologs of these zinc cluster proteins have been identified in several species  of Candida. Upc2 plays a critical role in antifungal resistance in these  important human fungal pathogens. Upc2 is therefore an interesting potential  target for novel antifungals. In this review we discuss the functions, mode of  actions and regulation of Ecm22, Upc2, Sut1 and Sut2 in budding yeast and  Candida.', 'Saccharomyces cerevisiae normally will not take up sterols from the environment  under aerobic conditions. A specific mutant, upc2-1, of the predicted  transcriptional activator UPC2 (YDR213w) has been recognized as a strain that  allows a high level of aerobic sterol uptake. Another predicted transcriptional  activator, the YLR228c gene product, is highly homologous to Upc2p. In fact, at  the carboxy terminus 130 of the last 139 amino acids are similar between the two  proteins. Since these proteins are very similar, the effect of mutations in the  YLR228c open reading frame (ORF) was compared with like alterations in UPC2.  First, the YLR228c ORF was insertionally inactivated and crossed with various  UPC2 constructs. Deletion of YLR228c and UPC2 in combination resulted in  nonviability, suggesting that the two proteins have some essential overlapping  function. The upc2-1 point mutation responsible for aerobic sterol uptake was  duplicated in the homologous carboxy region of the YLR228c ORF using  site-directed mutagenesis. This mutation on a high-copy vector resulted in an  increase in sterol uptake compared to an isogenic wild-type strain. The  combination of both point mutations resulted in the greatest level of aerobic  sterol uptake. When the YLR228c point mutation was expressed from a low-copy  vector there was little if any effect on sterol uptake. Gas chromatographic  analysis of the nonsaponifiable fractions of the various strains showed that the  major sterol for all YLR228c and UPC2 combinations was ergosterol, the consensus  yeast sterol.', 'The concept of protein function is widely used and manipulated by biologists.  However, the means of the concept and its understanding may vary depending on  the level of functionality one considers (molecular, cellular, physiological,  etc.). Genomic studies and new high-throughput methods of the post-genomic era  provide the opportunity to shed a new light on the concept of protein function:  protein-protein interactions can now be considered as pieces of incomplete but  still gigantic networks and the analysis of these networks will permit the  emergence of a more integrated view of protein function. In this context, we  propose a new functional classification method, which, unlike usual methods  based on sequence homology, allows the definition of functional classes of  protein based on the identity of their interacting partners. An example of such  classification will be shown and discussed for a subset of Saccharomyces  cerevisiae proteins, accounting for 7% of the yeast proteome. The genome of the  budding yeast contains 50% of protein-coding genes that are paralogs, including  457 pairs of duplicated genes coming probably from an ancient whole genome  duplication. We will comment on the functional classification of the duplicated  genes when using our method and discuss the contribution of these results to the  understanding of function evolution for the duplicated genes.', 'Gene duplications have been broadly implicated in the generation of  testis-specific genes. To perform a comprehensive analysis of paralogous  testis-biased genes, we characterized the testes transcriptome of Drosophila  melanogaster by comparing gene expression in testes vs. ovaries, heads, and  gonadectomized males. A number of the identified 399 testis-biased genes code  for the known components of mature sperm. Among the detected 69 genes  downregulated in testes, a large fraction is required for viability. By  analyzing paralogs of testis-biased genes, we identified ""co-regulated""  paralogous pairs in which both genes are testis biased, ""anti-regulated"" pairs  in which one paralog is testis biased and the other downregulated in testes, and  ""neutral"" pairs in which one paralog is testis biased and the other  constitutively expressed. The numbers of identified co-regulated and  anti-regulated pairs were higher than expected by chance. Testis-biased genes  included in these pairs show decreased frequency of lethal mutations, suggesting  their specific role in male reproduction. These genes also show exceptionally  high interspecific variability of expression in comparison between D.  melanogaster and the closely related D. simulans. Further, interspecific changes  in testis bias of expression are generally correlated within the co-regulated  pairs and are anti-correlated within the anti-regulated pairs, suggesting  coordinated regulation within both types of paralogous gene pairs.', 'BACKGROUND: Ubiquilins are proteins that function as ubiquitin receptors in  eukaryotes. Mutations in two ubiquilin-encoding genes have been linked to the  genesis of neurodegenerative diseases. However, ubiquilin functions are still  poorly understood. RESULTS: In this study, evolutionary and functional data are combined to  determine the origin and diversification of the ubiquilin gene family and to  characterize novel potential roles of ubiquilins in mammalian species, including  humans. The analysis of more than six hundred sequences allowed characterizing  ubiquilin diversity in all the main eukaryotic groups. Many organisms (e. g.  fungi, many animals) have single ubiquilin genes, but duplications in animal,  plant, alveolate and excavate species are described. Seven different ubiquilins  have been detected in vertebrates. Two of them, here called UBQLN5 and UBQLN6,  had not been hitherto described. Significantly, marsupial and eutherian mammals  have the most complex ubiquilin gene families, composed of up to 6 genes. This  exceptional mammalian-specific expansion is the result of the recent emergence  of four new genes, three of them (UBQLN3, UBQLN5 and UBQLNL) with precise  testis-specific expression patterns that indicate roles in the postmeiotic  stages of spermatogenesis. A gene with related features has independently arisen  in species of the Drosophila genus. Positive selection acting on some mammalian  ubiquilins has been detected. CONCLUSIONS: The ubiquilin gene family is highly conserved in eukaryotes. The  infrequent lineage-specific amplifications observed may be linked to the  emergence of novel functions in particular tissues.', 'The transition between a unicellular yeast form to multicellular filaments is  crucial for budding yeast foraging and the pathogenesis of many fungal pathogens  such as Candida albicans. Here, we examine the role of the related transcription  factors Ecm22 and Upc2 in Saccharomyces cerevisiae filamentation. Overexpression  of either ECM22 or UPC2 leads to increased filamentation, whereas cells lacking  both ECM22 and UPC2 do not exhibit filamentous growth. Ecm22 and Upc2 positively  control the expression of FHN1, NPR1, PRR2 and sterol biosynthesis genes. These  genes all play a positive role in filamentous growth, and their expression is  upregulated during filamentation in an Ecm22/Upc2-dependent manner. Furthermore,  ergosterol content increases during filamentous growth. UPC2 expression also  increases during filamentation and is inhibited by the transcription factors  Sut1 and Sut2. The expression of SUT1 and SUT2 in turn is under negative control  of the transcription factor Ste12. We suggest that during filamentation Ste12  becomes activated and reduces SUT1/SUT2 expression levels. This would result in  increased UPC2 levels and as a consequence to transcriptional activation of  FHN1, NPR1, PRR2 and sterol biosynthesis genes. Higher ergosterol levels in  combination with the proteins Fhn1, Npr1 and Prr2 would then mediate the  transition to filamentous growth.', 'Saccharomyces cerevisiae ergosterol biosynthesis, like cholesterol biosynthesis  in mammals, is regulated at the transcriptional level by a sterol feedback  mechanism. Yeast studies defined a 7-bp consensus sterol-response element (SRE)  common to genes involved in sterol biosynthesis and two transcription factors,  Upc2 and Ecm22, which direct transcription of sterol biosynthetic genes. The  7-bp consensus SRE is identical to the anaerobic response element, AR1c. Data  indicate that Upc2 and Ecm22 function through binding to this SRE site. We now  show that it is two novel anaerobic AR1b elements in the UPC2 promoter that  direct global ERG gene expression in response to a block in de novo ergosterol  biosynthesis, brought about by antifungal drug treatment. The AR1b elements are  absolutely required for auto-induction of UPC2 gene expression and protein and  require Upc2 and Ecm22 for function. We further demonstrate the direct binding  of recombinant expressed S. cerevisiae ScUpc2 and pathogenic Candida albicans  CaUpc2 and Candida glabrata CgUpc2 to AR1b and SRE/AR1c elements. Recombinant  endogenous promoter studies show that the UPC2 anaerobic AR1b elements act in  trans to regulate ergosterol gene expression. Our results indicate that Upc2  must occupy UPC2 AR1b elements in order for ERG gene expression induction to  take place. Thus, the two UPC2-AR1b elements drive expression of all ERG genes  necessary for maintaining normal antifungal susceptibility, as wild type cells  lacking these elements have increased susceptibility to azole antifungal drugs.  Therefore, targeting these specific sites for antifungal therapy represents a  novel approach to treat systemic fungal infections.']]]",The paralog of yeast UPC2 is YLR228c.,"[{'Exact': array([-5.86620716e-03, -8.45724981e-01,  1.12935168e+00, -5.14597858e-01,

All women received a single dose of elagolix 200  mg (renal) or 150 mg (hepatic). Intensive pharmacokinetic blood samples were  collected. Elagolix exposures were comparable in women with normal renal  function and those with moderate/severe renal impairment or end-stage renal  disease. Elagolix exposures also appeared to be similar in women with normal  hepatic function and women with mild hepatic impairment. Elagolix area under the  curve in women with moderate hepatic impairment and with severe hepatic  impairment was approximately 3-fold and 7-fold higher than in women with normal  hepatic function. The adverse event incidence was low, with the main events  being mild nausea and headache. No dosage adjustment was needed in women with  renal impairment or women with mild hepatic impairment. Although an elagolix  dose of 150 mg once daily may be used in women with moderate hepatic impairment  for up to 6 months, this elagolix dose should not be used in women with severe  hepatic impairment.', 'Elagolix is an oral gonadotropin-releasing hormone receptor antagonist indicated  for the management of endometriosis-associated pain and in combination with  estradiol/norethindrone acetate indicated for the management of heavy menstrual  bleeding associated with uterine leiomyomas (fibroids) in premenopausal women.  Elagolix coadministered with estradiol/norethindrone acetate is in late-stage  development for the management of heavy menstrual bleeding associated with  uterine fibroids. Based on the in vitro profile of elagolix metabolism and  disposition, 9 drug-drug interaction (DDI) studies evaluating the victim and  perpetrator characteristics of elagolix were conducted in 144 healthy  volunteers. As a victim of cytochrome P450 (CYPs) and transporter-mediated DDIs,  elagolix area under the curve (AUC) increased by ∼2-fold following  coadministration with ketoconazole and by ∼5- and ∼2-fold with single and  multiple doses of rifampin, respectively. As a perpetrator, elagolix decreased  midazolam AUC (90% confidence interval) by 54% (50%-59%) and increased digoxin  AUC by 32% (23%-41%). Elagolix decreased rosuvastatin AUC by 40% (29%-50%). No  clinically significant changes in exposure on coadministration with sertraline  or fluconazole occurred. A elagolix 150-mg once-daily regimen should be limited  to 6\xa0months with strong CYP3A inhibitors and rifampin because of the potential  increase in bone mineral density loss, as described in the drug label. A 200-mg  twice-daily regimen is recommended for no more than 1\xa0month with strong CYP3A  inhibitors and not recommended with rifampin. Elagolix is contraindicated with  strong organic anion transporter polypeptide B1 inhibitors (eg, cyclosporine and  gemfibrozil). Consider increasing the doses of midazolam and rosuvastatin when  coadministered with elagolix, and individualize therapy based on patient  response. Clinical monitoring is recommended for P-glycoprotein substrates with  a narrow therapeutic window (eg, digoxin). Dose adjustments are not required for  sertraline, fluconazole, bupropion (or any CYP2B6 substrate), or elagolix when  coadministered.', 'Results from the phase 3 HERO trial(NCT03085095), presented during the 2020  American Society of Clinical Oncology Virtual Scientific Program, indicated that  relugolix (Relumina) demonstrated superiority over leuprolide (Lupron) in  sustained testosterone suppression through 48 weeks, fast testosterone recovery  after discontinuation, and a 50% reduction in major adverse cardiovascular  events (MACE) in patients with advanced prostate cancer.', 'OBJECTIVE: To investigate the noninferiority of relugolix compared with  leuprorelin acetate in reducing heavy menstrual bleeding associated with uterine  leiomyomas. METHODS: In a double-blind, double-dummy trial, premenopausal women with uterine  leiomyomas and heavy menstrual bleeding defined as a pictorial blood loss  assessment chart score of at least 120 were randomized in a 1:1 ratio to  relugolix (40 mg, oral, once daily) or leuprorelin acetate (1.88 mg or 3.75 mg,  monthly injection) for 24 weeks. The primary endpoint was the proportion of  patients with a total pictorial blood loss assessment chart score of less than  10 for weeks 6-12. Secondary endpoints included myoma and uterine volumes, and  hemoglobin levels. A sample size of 144 patients per group (n=288) was estimated  to provide at least 90% power to demonstrate noninferiority (prespecified  noninferiority margin -15%; one-sided 0.025 level of significance). RESULTS: From March 2016 to September 2017, 281 patients were randomized  (relugolix, n=139, leuprorelin n=142). Demographic and baseline characteristics  were well balanced; mean pictorial blood loss assessment chart score was 254.3  in the relugolix group and 263.7 in the leuprorelin group. The proportion of  patients with total pictorial blood loss assessment chart score of less than 10  for weeks 6-12 was 82.2% in the relugolix group and 83.1% in the leuprorelin  group, demonstrating noninferiority of relugolix compared with leuprorelin  (relugolix-leuprorelin difference -0.9%; 95% CI: -10.10 to 8.35; prespecified  noninferiority margin -15%; P=.001). Reductions in myoma and uterine volumes and  increases in hemoglobin levels were comparable in the two groups. Relugolix was  associated with an earlier effect on menstrual bleeding than leuprorelin  (pictorial blood loss assessment chart score of less than 10, 64.2% vs 31.7%  [relugolix-leuprorelin difference 32.5%; 95% CI: 20.95-44.13%] for weeks 2-6 and  pictorial blood loss assessment chart score of 0, 52.6% vs 21.8% [30.7%; 95% CI:  19.45-42.00%] for weeks 2-6) and faster recovery of menses after treatment  discontinuation (relugolix median [Q1, Q3], 37 days [32.0, 46.0]; leuprorelin  median, 65 days [54.0, 77.0]). Adverse events and bone mineral density loss were  similar between relugolix and leuprorelin treatment groups. CONCLUSION: In women with uterine leiomyomas, once-daily treatment with  relugolix, an oral gonadotropin-releasing hormone antagonist, demonstrated  noninferiority to monthly leuprorelin for improvement of heavy menstrual  bleeding at 6-12 weeks of treatment, had a more rapid effect on menstrual  bleeding, and was generally well tolerated.

FUNDING SOURCE: Takeda Pharmaceutical Company Limited and an affiliate of  NovaQuest Capital Management LLC.', ""BACKGROUND: Amyotrophic lateral sclerosis is a rapidly progressive  neurodegenerative disorder characterised by loss of motor neurons leading to  severe weakness and death from respiratory failure within 3-5 years. Riluzole  prolongs survival in ALS. A published report has suggested a dramatic effect of  lithium carbonate on survival. 44 patients were studied, with 16 randomly  selected to take LiCO3 and riluzole and 28 allocated to take riluzole alone. In  the group treated with lithium, no patients had died (i.e., 100% survival) at  the end of the study (15 months from entry), compared to 71% surviving in the  riluzole-only group. Although the trial can be criticised on several grounds,  there is a substantial rationale from other laboratory studies that lithium is  worth investigating therapeutically in amyotrophic lateral sclerosis. METHODS/DESIGN: LiCALS is a multi-centre double-blind randomised parallel group  controlled trial of the efficacy, safety, and tolerability of lithium carbonate  (LiCO3) at doses to achieve stable 'therapeutic' plasma levels (0.4-0.8 mmol/L),  plus standard treatment, versus matched placebo plus standard treatment, in  patients with amyotrophic lateral sclerosis. The study will be based in the UK,  in partnership with the MND Association and DeNDRoN (the Dementias and  Neurodegnerative Diseases Clinical Research Network). 220 patients will be  recruited. All patients will be on the standard treatment for ALS of riluzole  100 mg daily. The primary outcome measure will be death from any cause at 18  months defined from the date of randomisation. Secondary outcome measures will  be changes in three functional rating scales, the ALS Functional Rating  Scale-Revised, The EuroQOL (EQ-5D), and the Hospital Anxiety and Depression  Scale.Eligible patients will have El Escorial Possible, Laboratory-supported  Probable, Probable or Definite amyotrophic lateral sclerosis with disease  duration between 6 months and 36 months (inclusive), vital capacity ≥ 60% of  predicted within 1 month prior to randomisation and age at least18 years.

DESIGN: Phase 3, multicenter, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled  study. SETTING: Medical centers. PATIENT(S): Premenopausal Japanese women (N = 65) experiencing  moderate-to-severe uterine fibroid-associated pain with a maximum Numerical  Rating Scale (NRS) score of ≥4 were randomized and completed the study. INTERVENTION(S): Once-daily 40\xa0mg relugolix (n = 33) or placebo (n = 32) for  12\xa0weeks. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURE(S): Primary end point: proportion of patients with a  maximum NRS score of ≤1 during the 28-day period before the final dose of study  drug. Secondary end points: proportion of patients with no pain (NRS = 0) and  percentage of days without pain during the 28-day period before the final dose  of study drug; adverse events. RESULT(S): More patients receiving relugolix versus placebo achieved a maximum  NRS score of ≤1 during the 28-day period before the final dose of study drug  (57.6% vs. 3.1%). Similarly, more patients receiving relugolix versus placebo  achieved a maximum NRS score of 0 (48.5% vs. 3.1%) and experienced more days  without pain (96.4% vs. 71.4%). More patients receiving relugolix versus placebo  experienced treatment-emergent adverse events (TEAEs; 87.9% vs. 56.3%); however,  the rate of treatment discontinuation was low and not different between groups.  Most TEAEs were mild to moderate in intensity. TEAEs (≥10%) included hot flush,  metrorrhagia, hyperhidrosis, and menorrhagia, consistent with relugolix's  mechanism of action, and viral upper respiratory tract infection.

The  use of new compounds, such as natalizumab or fingolimod, is restricted to severe  forms of relapsing MS or cases refractory to first-line treatment owing to  substance-specific risk-benefit considerations. Teriflunomide is a new compound  which has recently been approved as a first-line treatment of relapsing forms of  MS in the USA and Australia. It is characterized by a once daily oral  administration and a comparably well-established long-term safety profile. The  main therapeutic effect is considered to be mediated via the inhibition of the  de novo synthesis of pyrimidine in proliferating immune cells. The pro-drug of  teriflunomide, leflunomide, has a label for treating rheumatoid arthritis (RA)  for many years. Two recently published phase III clinical trials (TEMSO, TOWER)  tested teriflunomide in patients with relapsing forms of MS and efficacy was  demonstrated, with positive effects on relapse rates and disease progression  using 14 mg/day. Overall, the safety profile in these studies was favorable as  expected from experiences with leflunomide in RA. In patients treated with  teriflunomide regular monitoring of blood cell counts and liver enzymes is  required. Teriflunomide must not be used during pregnancy. In this article the  recent phase II and phase III clinical trial data are reviewed and the potential  of teriflunomide for the treatment of relapsing forms of MS is discussed.', 'BACKGROUND: Injectable luteinizing hormone-releasing hormone agonists (e.g.,  leuprolide) are the standard agents for achieving androgen deprivation for  prostate cancer despite the initial testosterone surge and delay in therapeutic  effect. The efficacy and safety of relugolix, an oral gonadotropin-releasing  hormone antagonist, as compared with those of leuprolide are not known. METHODS: In this phase 3 trial, we randomly assigned patients with advanced  prostate cancer, in a 2:1 ratio, to receive relugolix (120 mg orally once daily)  or leuprolide (injections every 3 months) for 48 weeks. The primary end point  was sustained testosterone suppression to castrate levels (<50 ng per deciliter)  through 48 weeks. Secondary end points included noninferiority with respect to  the primary end point, castrate levels of testosterone on day 4, and profound  castrate levels (<20 ng per deciliter) on day 15. Testosterone recovery was  evaluated in a subgroup of patients. RESULTS: A total of 622 patients received relugolix and 308 received leuprolide.  Of men who received relugolix, 96.7% (95% confidence interval [CI], 94.9 to  97.9) maintained castration through 48 weeks, as compared with 88.8% (95% CI,  84.6 to 91.8) of men receiving leuprolide. The difference of 7.9 percentage  points (95% CI, 4.1 to 11.8) showed noninferiority and superiority of relugolix  (P<0.001 for superiority). All other key secondary end points showed superiority  of relugolix over leuprolide (P<0.001). The percentage of patients with castrate  levels of testosterone on day 4 was 56.0% with relugolix and 0% with leuprolide.  In the subgroup of 184 patients followed for testosterone recovery, the mean  testosterone levels 90 days after treatment discontinuation were 288.4 ng per  deciliter in the relugolix group and 58.6 ng per deciliter in the leuprolide  group. Among all the patients, the incidence of major adverse cardiovascular  events was 2.9% in the relugolix group and 6.2% in the leuprolide group (hazard  ratio, 0.46; 95% CI, 0.24 to 0.88). CONCLUSIONS: In this trial involving men with advanced prostate cancer,  relugolix achieved rapid, sustained suppression of testosterone levels that was  superior to that with leuprolide, with a 54% lower risk of major adverse  cardiovascular events.

Two benzothiazolamines, riluzole and lubeluzole,  are known blockers of voltage-gated sodium (Nav) channels. Riluzole is  clinically used as a neuroprotectant in amyotrophic lateral sclerosis.  Inhibition of Nav channels by riluzole is voltage-dependent due to preferential  binding to inactivated sodium channels. Yet the drug exerts little use-dependent  block, probably because it lacks protonable amine. One important property is  riluzole ability to inhibit persistent Na+ currents, which likely contributes to  its neuroprotective activity. Lubeluzole showed promising neuroprotective  effects in animal stroke models, but failed to show benefits in acute ischemic  stroke in humans. One important concern is its propensity to prolong the cardiac  QT interval, due to hERG K+ channel block. Lubeluzole very potently inhibits Nav  channels in a voltage- and use-dependent manner, due to its great preferential  affinity for inactivated channels and the presence of a protonable amine group.  Patch-clamp experiments suggest that the binding sites of both drugs overlap the  local anesthetic receptor within the ion-conducting pathway. Riluzole and  lubeluzole displayed very potent antimyotonic activity in a rat model of  myotonia, a pathological skeletal muscle condition characterized by  high-frequency runs of action potentials. Such results well support the  repurposing of riluzole as an antimyotonic drug, allowing the launch of a pilot  study in myotonic patients. Riluzole, lubeluzole, and new Nav channel blockers  built on the benzothiazolamine scaffold will certainly continue to be  investigated for possible clinical applications.']]]",Advanced prostate cancer,"[{'Exact': array([ 0.68387266,  1.70742323,  0.64540119, 11.48932642, -1.7269411 ,

Has field-programmable gate array (FPGA) technology been used to solve sequence alignment problems?,"[[['Advances in computational biology have occurred primarily in the areas of  software and algorithm development; new designs of hardware to support  biological computing are extremely scarce. This is due, we believe, to the  presence of a non-trivial knowledge gap between molecular biologists and  computer designers. The existence of this gap is unfortunate, as it has long  been known that for certain problems, special-purpose computers can achieve  significant cost/performance gains over general-purpose machines. We describe  one such computer here: a custom accelerator for gene sequence analysis. The  accelerator implements a version of the Needleman-Wunsch algorithm for  nucleotide sequence alignment. Sequence lengths are constrained only by  available memory; the product of sequence lengths in the current implementation  can be up to 2(22). The machine is implemented as two NuBus boards connected to  a Mac IIf/x, using a mixture of TTL and FPGA technology clocked at 10 MHz. The  boards are completely functional, and yield a 15-fold performance improvement  over an unassisted host.', 'BACKGROUND: The Smith-Waterman algorithm is known to be a more sensitive  approach than heuristic algorithms for local sequence alignment algorithms.  Despite its sensitivity, a greater time complexity associated with the  Smith-Waterman algorithm prevents its application to the all-pairs comparisons  of base sequences, which aids in the construction of accurate phylogenetic  trees. The aim of this study is to achieve greater acceleration using the  Smith-Waterman algorithm (by realizing interpair block pruning and band  optimization) compared with that achieved using a previous method that performs  intrapair block pruning on graphics processing units (GPUs). RESULTS: We present an interpair optimization method for the Smith-Waterman  algorithm with the aim of accelerating the all-pairs comparison of base  sequences. Given the results of the pairs of sequences, our method realizes  efficient block pruning by computing a lower bound for other pairs that have not  yet been processed. This lower bound is further used for band optimization. We  integrated our interpair optimization method into SW#, a previous GPU-based  implementation that employs variants of a banded Smith-Waterman algorithm and a  banded Myers-Miller algorithm. Evaluation using the six genomes of Bacillus  anthracis shows that our method pruned 88% of the matrix cells on a single GPU  and 73% of the matrix cells on two GPUs. For the genomes of the human chromosome  21, the alignment performance reached 202 giga-cell updates per second (GCUPS)  on two Tesla K40 GPUs. CONCLUSIONS: Efficient interpair pruning and band optimization makes it possible  to complete the all-pairs comparisons of the sequences of the same species 1.2  times faster than the intrapair pruning method. This acceleration was achieved  at the first phase of SW#, where our method significantly improved the initial  lower bound. However, our interpair optimization was not effective for the  comparison of the sequences of different species such as comparing human,  chimpanzee, and gorilla. Consequently, our method is useful in accelerating the  applications that require optimal local alignments scores for the same species.

Next-Generation Sequencing technologies produce genomic data  of longer reads. Cloud platforms are adopted to address the problems arising  from storage and analysis of large genomic data. Existing genes sequencing tools  for cloud platforms predominantly consider short read gene sequences and adopt  the Hadoop MapReduce framework for computation. However, serial execution of map  and reduce phases is a problem in such systems. Therefore, in this paper, we  introduce Burrows-Wheeler Aligner's Smith-Waterman Alignment on Parallel  MapReduce (BWASW-PMR) cloud platform for long sequence alignment. The proposed  cloud platform adopts a widely accepted and accurate BWA-SW algorithm for long  sequence alignment. A custom MapReduce platform is developed to overcome the  drawbacks of the Hadoop framework. A parallel execution strategy of the  MapReduce phases and optimization of Smith-Waterman algorithm are considered.  Performance evaluation results exhibit an average speed-up of 6.7 considering  BWASW-PMR compared with the state-of-the-art Bwasw-Cloud. An average reduction  of 30% in the map phase makespan is reported across all experiments comparing  BWASW-PMR with Bwasw-Cloud. Optimization of Smith-Waterman results in reducing  the execution time by 91.8%. The experimental study proves the efficiency of  BWASW-PMR for aligning long genomic sequences on cloud platforms."", 'Large-scale protein sequence comparison is an important but compute-intensive  task in molecular biology. BLASTP is the most popular tool for comparative  analysis of protein sequences. In recent years, an exponential increase in the  size of protein sequence databases has required either exponentially more  running time or a cluster of machines to keep pace. To address this problem, we  have designed and built a high-performance FPGA-accelerated version of BLASTP,  Mercury BLASTP. In this paper, we describe the architecture of the portions of  the application that are accelerated in the FPGA, and we also describe the  integration of these FPGA-accelerated portions with the existing BLASTP  software. We have implemented Mercury BLASTP on a commodity workstation with two  Xilinx Virtex-II 6000 FPGAs. We show that the new design runs 11-15 times faster  than software BLASTP on a modern CPU while delivering close to 99% identical  results.', 'BACKGROUND: This paper describes techniques for accelerating the performance of  the string set matching problem with particular emphasis on applications in  computational proteomics. The process of matching peptide sequences against a  genome translated in six reading frames is part of a proteogenomic mapping  pipeline that is used as a case-study. The Aho-Corasick algorithm is adapted for  execution in field programmable gate array (FPGA) devices in a manner that  optimizes space and performance. In this approach, the traditional Aho-Corasick  finite state machine (FSM) is split into smaller FSMs, operating in parallel,  each of which matches up to 20 peptides in the input translated genome. Each of  the smaller FSMs is further divided into five simpler FSMs such that each simple  FSM operates on a single bit position in the input (five bits are sufficient for  representing all amino acids and special symbols in protein sequences). RESULTS: This bit-split organization of the Aho-Corasick implementation enables  efficient utilization of the limited random access memory (RAM) resources  available in typical FPGAs. The use of on-chip RAM as opposed to FPGA logic  resources for FSM implementation also enables rapid reconfiguration of the FPGA  without the place and routing delays associated with complex digital designs. CONCLUSION: Experimental results show storage efficiencies of over 80% for  several data sets. Furthermore, the FPGA implementation executing at 100 MHz is  nearly 20 times faster than an implementation of the traditional Aho-Corasick  algorithm executing on a 2.67 GHz workstation.', 'Searching a database for a local alignment to a query under a typical scoring  scheme, such as PAM120 or BLOSUM62 with affine gap costs, is a computation that  has resisted algorithmic improvement due to its basis in dynamic programming and  the weak nature of the signals being searched for. In a query preprocessing  step, a set of tables can be built that permit one to (a) eliminate a large  fraction of the dynamic programming matrix from consideration and (b) to compute  several steps of the remainder with a single table lookup. While this result is  not an asymptotic improvement over the original Smith-Waterman algorithm, its  complexity is characterized in terms of some sparse features of the matrix and  it yields the fastest software implementation to date for such searches.', 'Alignment-free algorithms can be used to estimate the similarity of biological  sequences and hence are often applied to the phylogenetic reconstruction of  genomes. Most of these algorithms rely on comparing the frequency of all the  distinct substrings of fixed length (k-mers) that occur in the analyzed  sequences. In this paper, we present Logic Alignment Free (LAF), a method that  combines alignment-free techniques and rule-based classification algorithms in  order to assign biological samples to their taxa. This method searches for a  minimal subset of k-mers whose relative frequencies are used to build  classification models as disjunctive-normal-form logic formulas (if-then rules).  We apply LAF successfully to the classification of bacterial genomes to their  corresponding taxonomy. In particular, we succeed in obtaining reliable  classification at different taxonomic levels by extracting a handful of rules,  each one based on the frequency of just few k-mers. State of the art methods to  adjust the frequency of k-mers to the character distribution of the underlying  genomes have negligible impact on classification performance, suggesting that  the signal of each class is strong and that LAF is effective in identifying it.', 'To infer homology and subsequently gene function, the Smith-Waterman algorithm  is used to find the optimal local alignment between two sequences. When  searching sequence databases that may contain billions of sequences, this  algorithm becomes computationally expensive. Consequently, in this paper, we  focused on accelerating the Smith-Waterman algorithm by modifying the  computationally repeated portion of the algorithm by FPGA hardware custom  instructions. These simple modifications accelerated the algorithm runtime by an  average of 287% compared to the pure software implementation. Therefore, further  design of FPGA accelerated hardware offers a promising direction to seeking  runtime improvement of genomic database searching.', ""BACKGROUND: To infer homology and subsequently gene function, the Smith-Waterman  (SW) algorithm is used to find the optimal local alignment between two  sequences. When searching sequence databases that may contain hundreds of  millions of sequences, this algorithm becomes computationally expensive. RESULTS: In this paper, we focused on accelerating the Smith-Waterman algorithm  by using FPGA-based hardware that implemented a module for computing the score  of a single cell of the SW matrix. Then using a grid of this module, the entire  SW matrix was computed at the speed of field propagation through the FPGA  circuit. These modifications dramatically accelerated the algorithm's  computation time by up to 160 folds compared to a pure software implementation  running on the same FPGA with an Altera Nios II softprocessor. CONCLUSION: This design of FPGA accelerated hardware offers a new promising  direction to seeking computation improvement of genomic database searching."", ""MOTIVATION: The alignment of bisulfite-treated DNA sequences (BS-seq reads) to a  large genome involves a significant computational burden beyond that required to  align non-bisulfite-treated reads. In the analysis of BS-seq data, this can  present an important performance bottleneck that can be mitigated by appropriate  algorithmic and software-engineering improvements. One strategy is to modify the  read-alignment algorithms by integrating the logic related to BS-seq alignment,  with the goal of making the software implementation amenable to optimizations  that lead to higher speed and greater sensitivity than might otherwise be  attainable. RESULTS: We evaluated this strategy using Arioc, a short-read aligner that uses  GPU (general-purpose graphics processing unit) hardware to accelerate  computationally-expensive programming logic. We integrated the BS-seq  computational logic into both GPU and CPU code throughout the Arioc  implementation. We then carried out a read-by-read comparison of Arioc's  reported alignments with the alignments reported by well-known CPU-based BS-seq  read aligners. With simulated reads, Arioc's accuracy is equal to or better than  the other read aligners we evaluated. With human sequencing reads, Arioc's  throughput is at least 10 times faster than existing BS-seq aligners across a  wide range of sensitivity settings.

Which are the main functions of the human HuR (ELAVL1) protein in fibroblasts?,"[[[""In the nucleus HuR binds to mRNAs containing adenylate-uridylate rich elements  in the 3'-untranslated region. HuR may influence expression of its ligand mRNA  through regulation of polyadenylation, translocation of the message to the  cytosol, stabilization of the mRNA and/or altering its translational efficiency.  Suppression of HuR using siRNA resulted in an attenuation of the 3T3-L1  differentiation program, consistent with HuR control of the expression of mRNA  ligand(s) critical to the differentiation process. In the present study, we  begin to identify mRNA ligands of HuR whose regulated expression is necessary  for adipogenesis."", 'p19(ARF) plays an essential role in the senescence of mouse cells, and its  expression is lost by methylation or deletion of the ARF locus; otherwise, p53  is inactivated to bypass senescence. ARF expression is tightly regulated, but  little is known about its posttranscriptional regulation. Here, we show that an  RNA-binding protein, HuR (human antigen R), represses ARF mRNA translation,  thereby maintaining the replicative life span of mouse embryonic fibroblasts  (MEFs). Loss of HuR results in premature senescence, with concomitant increases  in p19(ARF) but not p16(Ink4a) levels, and this senescence is not observed in  ARF-null MEFs that retain an intact Ink4a locus. HuR depletion does not alter  ARF transcription or stability but enhances ribosome association with ARF mRNA.  Under these conditions, ARF mRNA accumulates in nucleoli, where it associates  with nucleolin. Furthermore, adipose-specific deletion of the HuR gene results  in increased p19(ARF) expression in aged animals, which is accompanied by  decreased insulin sensitivity. Together, our findings demonstrate that p19(ARF)  is also regulated at the translational level, and this translational regulation  restrains the cellular life span and tissue functions in vivo.', ""The post-transcriptional control of specific mRNAs is a widespread mechanism of  gene regulation, which contributes to numerous biological processes in a number  of cell types. The Forkhead box O (FoxO) transcription factor FOXO1 is an  important tumor suppressor involved in apoptosis, the cell cycle, DNA damage  repair and oxidative stress. Bioinformatic prediction identified that the 3'  untranslated region (UTR) of FOXO1 is enriched with binding motifs for the human  ELAV/Hu protein (HuR), indicating that FOXO1 is a potential target of HuR.  Luciferase reporter assays demonstrate that HuR specifically regulates FOXO1  expression through AU-rich elements (AREs) within the FOXO1 3' UTR.  Immunoprecipitation studies confirmed that HuR associates with FOXO1 mRNA in  MDA-MB-231 breast cancer cells and that HuR upregulates FOXO1 mRNA levels  through increased mRNA stability. Using a HuR loss- and gain-of-function  approach, we revealed that FOXO1 expression was correspondingly decreased or  increased in MDA-MB-231 cells. Functional assays demonstrated that HuR and FOXO1  expression levels were markedly enhanced upon 5-fluorouracil (5-FU) stimulation  in MDA-MB-231 cells. Knockdown of HuR apparently abrogated 5-FU-induced  apoptosis detected by caspase-3 activities. Furthermore, in HuR knockdown cells,  additional overexpression of FOXO1 moderately recovered 5-FU-induced apoptosis,  which verified that HuR-modulated apoptosis upon 5-FU treatment was partially  mediated by its post-transcriptional regulation of FOXO1. Therefore, modulating  FOXO1 expression has been suggested to lead to the development of new  therapeutic treatments for certain types of cancer."", ""Tumors of the central nervous system (CNS) often have sustained expression of  labile genes, including angiogenic growth factors and immunosuppressive  cytokines, which promote tumor progression. Stabilization of the RNA transcripts  for these genes, such as vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF), is an  important molecular pathway for this up-regulation. HuR, a member of the Elav  family of RNA-binding proteins, has been implicated in this pathway through its  binding to adenine and uridine (AU)-rich stability elements (ARE) located in the  3' untranslated regions (3'-UTRs) of the mRNA. Whereas three of the Elav family  members (Hel-N1, HuC, and HuD) are restricted to young and mature neurons, HuR  is more broadly expressed, including proliferating cells of the developing CNS.  Because RNA stabilization of labile genes may promote tumor growth, we analyzed  and compared the expression pattern of HuR in 35 freshly resected and cultured  CNS tumors to determine whether there was any correlation with tumor grade or  histological type. We found that HuR mRNA was consistently expressed in all of  the tumors, regardless of cell origin or degree of malignancy. Using a novel  HuR-specific polyclonal antibody, we found that strong HuR protein expression  was limited to high-grade malignancies (glioblastoma multiforme and  medulloblastoma). Within the glioblastoma multiforme, prominent HuR expression  was also detected in perinecrotic areas in which angiogenic growth factors are  up-regulated. To further define its role as a potential RNA stabilizer, we  analyzed whether HuR could bind to the stability motifs within the 3'-UTRs of  cytokines and growth factors linked to brain tumor progression. We used a novel  ELISA-based RNA binding assay and focused on the 3'-UTRs of angiogenic factors  VEGF, COX-2, and (interleukin) IL-8 as well as the immunomodulating factors  IL-6, transforming growth factor (TGF)-beta and tumor necrosis factor  (TNF)-alpha as potential RNA ligands. Our results indicated overall a very high  binding affinity to these RNA targets. A comparison of these ligands revealed a  hierarchy of binding affinities with the angiogenic factors, and TGF-beta  showing the highest (Kd of 1.8-3.4 nM), and TNF-alpha the lowest (Kd of 18.3  nM). The expression pattern of HuR, coupled with the RNA binding data, strongly  suggests a role for this protein in the posttranscriptional regulation of these  genes in CNS tumors."", ""HuR is a ligand for nuclear mRNAs containing adenylate-uridylate-rich (ARE)  elements in the 3'-untranslated region. Once bound to the mRNA, HuR is  recognized by adapter proteins that then facilitate nuclear export of the  complex. In the cytosol, HuR is thought to function to control stability and  translation of its ligand message. We have previously demonstrated that HuR is  constitutively expressed in the 3T3-L1 cells and shuttles from the nucleus to  the cytosol, but remains predominantly nuclear in the preadipocytes and that as  the cells differentiate, there is a marked increase in the proportion of HuR in  the cytosol at any time. The GLUT1 glucose transporter is also expressed in both  preadipocytes and adipocytes and in vitro RNA gel shifts indicate the mRNA is a  ligand for HuR. However, HuR complexes containing the GLUT1 mRNA can only be  isolated from the terminally differentiated adipocytes. Moreover, position  analysis of the GLUT1 mRNA and HuR protein in polysome profiles demonstrates a  shift to the most dense region of the gradient for both message and protein with  adipocyte differentiation. Consistent with a regulatory role in the control of  GLUT1 expression, siRNA-mediated decrease in HuR protein resulted in a decreased  expression of GLUT1 protein. These data suggest that HuR contributes to the  metabolic function of the adipocyte through mediation of post-transcriptional  regulatory events."", ""The cytoplasmic events that control mammalian gene expression, primarily mRNA  stability and translation, potently influence the cellular response to internal  and external signals. The ubiquitous RNA-binding protein (RBP) HuR is one of the  best-studied regulators of cytoplasmic mRNA fate. Through its  post-transcriptional influence on specific target mRNAs, HuR can alter the  cellular response to proliferative, stress, apoptotic, differentiation,  senescence, inflammatory and immune stimuli. In light of its central role in  important cellular functions, HuR's role in diseases in which these responses  are aberrant is increasingly appreciated. Here, we review the mechanisms that  control HuR function, its influence on target mRNAs, and how impairment in  HuR-governed gene expression programs impact upon different disease processes.  We focus on HuR's well-recognized implication in cancer and chronic  inflammation, and discuss emerging studies linking HuR to cardiovascular,  neurological, and muscular pathologies. We also discuss the progress, potential,  and challenges of targeting HuR therapeutically."", ""The RNA binding protein HuR regulates the stability of many target mRNAs. Here,  we report that HuR associated with the 3' untranslated region of the mRNA  encoding the longevity and stress-response protein SIRT1, stabilized the SIRT1  mRNA, and increased SIRT1 expression levels. Unexpectedly, oxidative stress  triggered the dissociation of the [HuR-SIRT1 mRNA] complex, in turn promoting  SIRT1 mRNA decay, reducing SIRT1 abundance, and lowering cell survival. The cell  cycle checkpoint kinase Chk2 was activated by H(2)O(2), interacted with HuR, and  was predicted to phosphorylate HuR at residues S88, S100, and T118. Mutation of  these residues revealed a complex pattern of HuR binding, with S100 appearing to  be important for [HuR-SIRT1 mRNA] dissociation after H(2)O(2). Our findings  demonstrate that HuR regulates SIRT1 expression, underscore functional links  between the two stress-response proteins, and implicate Chk2 in these processes."", 'We report the antiapoptotic effect of RNA-binding protein HuR, a critical  regulator of the post-transcriptional fate of target transcripts. Among the most  prominent mRNAs complexing with HuR is that encoding prothymosin alpha  (ProTalpha), an inhibitor of the apoptosome. In HeLa cells, treatment with the  apoptotic stimulus ultraviolet light (UVC) triggered the mobilization of  ProTalpha mRNA to the cytoplasm and onto heavier polysomes, where its  association with HuR increased dramatically. Analysis of a chimeric ProTalpha  mRNA directly implicated HuR in regulating ProTalpha production: ProTalpha  translation and cytoplasmic concentration increased in HuR-overexpressing cells  and declined in cells in which HuR levels were lowered by RNA interference.  Importantly, the antiapoptotic influence engendered by HuR was vitally dependent  on ProTalpha expression, since use of oligomers that blocked ProTalpha  translation abrogated the protective effect of HuR. Together, our data support a  regulatory scheme whereby HuR binds the ProTalpha mRNA, elevates its cytoplasmic  abundance and translation, and thereby elicits an antiapoptotic program.', ""HuR is a ligand for nuclear mRNAs containing adenylate-uridylate rich elements  in the 3'-untranslated region. Once bound to the mRNA, HuR is recognized by  adapter proteins which then facilitate nuclear export of the complex. In the  cytosol HuR is thought to function to control stability and translation of its  ligand message. In the 3T3-L1 cells HuR is constitutively expressed and  localized predominantly to the nucleus in the preadipocytes. However within 30  min of exposure to the differentiation stimulus, the HuR content in the cytosol  increases consistent with HuR regulating the availability of relevant mRNAs for  translation. Using in vitro RNA gel shifts, we have demonstrated that the  C/EBPbeta message is a ligand for HuR and that the single binding site is an  adenylate-uridylate rich element in the 3'-untranslated region."", ""In this study, we investigated the molecular mechanisms underlying the ATP  analogue adenosine-5'-O-(3-thio)triphosphate-induced nucleocytoplasmic shuttling  of the mRNA stabilizing factor HuR in human (h) mesangial cells (MC). Using  synthetic protein kinase C (PKC) inhibitors and small interfering RNA  approaches, we demonstrated that knockdown of PKC alpha efficiently blocked the  ATP-dependent nuclear HuR export to the cytoplasm. The functional importance of  PKC alpha in HuR shuttling is highlighted by the high cytosolic HuR content  detected in hMC stably overexpressing PKC alpha compared with mock-transfected  cells. The ATP-induced recruitment of HuR to the cytoplasm is preceded by a  direct interaction of PKC alpha with nuclear HuR and accompanied by increased  Ser phosphorylation as demonstrated by coimmunoprecipitation experiments.  Mapping of putative PKC target sites identified serines 158 and 221 as being  indispensable for HuR phosphorylation by PKC alpha. RNA pull-down assay and RNA  electrophoretic mobility shift assay demonstrated that the HuR shuttling by ATP  is accompanied by an increased HuR binding to cyclooxygenase (COX)-2 mRNA.  Physiologically, the ATP-dependent increase in RNA binding is linked with an  augmentation in COX-2 mRNA stability and subsequent increase in prostaglandin  E(2) synthesis. Regulation of HuR via PKC alpha-dependent phosphorylation  emphasizes the importance of posttranslational modification for  stimulus-dependent HuR shuttling.""]]]","In mouse embryonic fibroblasts (MEFs), the human RNA-binding protein HuR (ELAVL1) plays a crucial role in maintaining the replicative lifespan of these cells. Specifically:

1. **Translation Regulation**: HuR represses the translation of the p19(ARF) mRNA, which is a tumor suppressor. This repression helps maintain the cell's lifespan by preventing premature senescence.

2. **Post-transcriptional Control**: HuR binds to the 3' untranslated region (UTR) of p19(ARF) mRNA, enhancing ribosome association and accumulation in the nucleoli. This leads to increased p19(ARF) protein levels, contributing to senescence when HuR is depleted.

3. **Cellular Lifespan Maintenance**: By controlling the expression of p19(ARF) through its binding to the mRNA, HuR helps regulate the cellular life span of MEFs.

Which chromosome contains the TLR7 locus in the human genome?,"[[[""INTRODUCTION: The Toll-like receptor 7 (TLR7) gene, encoded on human chromosome  Xp22.3, is crucial for type I interferon production. A recent multicenter study  in East Asian populations, comprising Chinese, Korean and Japanese participants,  identified an association of a TLR7 single-nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) located  in the 3' untranslated region (3' UTR), rs3853839, with systemic lupus  erythematosus (SLE), especially in males, although some difference was observed  among the tested populations. To test whether additional polymorphisms  contribute to SLE in Japanese, we systematically analyzed the association of  TLR7 with SLE in a Japanese female population. METHODS: A case-control association study was conducted on eight tag SNPs in the  TLR7 region, including rs3853839, in 344 Japanese females with SLE and 274  healthy female controls. RESULTS: In addition to rs3853839, two SNPs in intron 2, rs179019 and rs179010,  which were in moderate linkage disequilibrium with each other (r2 = 0.53),  showed an association with SLE (rs179019: P = 0.016, odds ratio (OR) 2.02, 95%  confidence interval (95% CI) 1.15 to 3.54; rs179010: P = 0.018, OR 1.75, 95% CI  1.10 to 2.80 (both under the recessive model)). Conditional logistic regression  analysis revealed that the association of the intronic SNPs and the 3' UTR SNP  remained significant after we adjusted them for each other. When only the  patients and controls carrying the risk genotypes at the 3' UTR SNP position  were analyzed, the risk of SLE was significantly increased when the individuals  also carried the risk genotypes at both of the intronic SNPs (P = 0.0043, OR  2.45, 95% CI 1.31 to 4.60). Furthermore, the haplotype containing the intronic  risk alleles in addition to the 3' UTR risk allele was associated with SLE under  the recessive model (P = 0.016, OR 2.37, 95% CI 1.17 to 4.80), but other  haplotypes were not associated with SLE. CONCLUSIONS: The TLR7 intronic SNPs rs179019 and rs179010 are associated with  SLE independently of the 3' UTR SNP rs3853839 in Japanese women. Our findings  support a role of TLR7 in predisposition for SLE in Asian populations."", ""The human genome is rich in sequences which are structurally related to the 7SL  RNA component of the signal recognition particle. The 7SL DNA sequence family  consists of four 7SL genes, 500 7SL pseudogenes (which are truncated at one or  both ends of the 7SL sequence) and 500,000 Alu sequences. Both 7SL genes and Alu  elements are transcribed by RNA polymerase III, and we show here that the  internal 7SL promoter lies within the Alu-like part of the 7SL gene. Why then  does RNA polymerase III transcribe the few 7SL genes so efficiently, while  transcripts from the far more abundant Alu elements are not readily detectable?  We find that a human 7SL gene and a synthetic Alu sequence derived from it are  expressed 50-100-fold more efficiently in vitro than either a representative Alu  element or two 7SL pseudogenes. 5' Deletion and insertion mutants of the 7SL  gene demonstrate that, in conjunction with the internal promoter, the first 37  nucleotides upstream from the transcription start site are essential for  efficient and accurate initiation in vitro. We suggest that the genomic  sequences upstream from most Alu elements and 7SL pseudogenes do not contain  this element, and consequently that only a small subset of such sequences can be  transcribed in vivo. This may help to explain the homogeneity of the Alu family  within each mammalian genome, as well as the species-specific differences  between mammalian Alu families."", 'Cutaneous melanoma is a life-threatening skin cancer. Its incidence is rapidly  increasing, and early diagnosis is the main factor able to improve its poor  prognosis. Toll-like receptors (TLRs) are transmembrane glycoproteins that  recognize pathogen- and damage-associated molecular patterns, against which TLRs  activate the innate immune response and initiate the adaptive immune response.  Genetic variations of these receptors may alter the immune system, and are  involved in evolution and susceptibility to various diseases, including cancer.  The aim of the present study was to evaluate whether the presence of TLR7  glutamine (Gln) 11 leucine (Leu) polymorphism confers an increased  susceptibility to cutaneous melanoma. For that purpose, a case-control study was  performed with 182 melanoma cases and 89 controls. To highlight the possible  association between the aforementioned polymorphism and the susceptibility to  melanoma, 93 cases of single melanoma and 89 cases of multiple primary melanoma  (MPM) were compared in the present study. Since the TLR7 gene is localized on  the chromosome X, the allelic frequency of the Gln11Leu polymorphism was  analyzed separately in males and females. The distribution of allele frequencies  between melanoma cases and controls (P=0.245) and between single melanoma and  MPM cases (P=0.482) was not significant. Therefore, the present results do not  suggest an association between TLR7 Gln11Leu polymorphism and susceptibility to  cutaneous melanoma. Further studies are required to analyze the influence of  other TLR polymorphisms on the susceptibility to malignant melanoma and the  involvement of innate immunity in this malignancy.', 'OBJECTIVES: To determine whether genetic variation within genes related to the  Toll-like receptor, inflammasome and interferon-γ pathways contributes to the  differences in treatment response to tumour necrosis factor inhibitors  (anti-TNF) in patients with rheumatoid arthritis (RA). METHODS: In a retrospective case-case study, we assessed 23 functional single  nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) in 15 genes. We included 538 anti-TNF naïve  Danish RA patients from the nationwide DANBIO database. Multivariable logistic  regression analyses were performed to detect associations (p-value<0.05) between  genotypes and European League Against Rheumatism (EULAR) treatment responses.  False Discovery Rate corrections for multiple testing (q-value) and stratified  analyses were performed to investigate association with individual therapies and  IgM-rheumatoid factor (RF) status. RESULTS: Six of twenty successfully genotyped polymorphisms were nominally  associated with EULAR treatment response. Three of these were in weak to  moderate linkage disequilibrium with polymorphisms previously reported  associated with anti-TNF treatment response. TLR5(rs5744174) variant allele  carriers (odds ratio(OR) = 1.7(1.1-2.5),p = 0.010,q = 0.46) and TLR1(rs4833095)  homozygous variant carriers (OR = 2.8(1.1-7.4),p = 0.037,q = 0.46) had higher  odds for a positive treatment response. NLRP3(rs10754558) variant allele  carriers (odds ratio(OR) = 0.6(0.4-1.0),p = 0.045,q = 0.46) were more likely to  have a negative treatment response. The association in TLR5(rs5744174) remained  significant after correction for multiple comparisons among patients negative  for RF (OR = 6.2(2.4-16.3),p = 0.0002,q = 0.024). No other association withstood  correction for multiple testing. Post hoc analyses showed that change in Patient  Global score on a visual analogue scale (VAS) and change in pain VAS were the  main factors responsible for the association. CONCLUSIONS: We reproduced previously reported associations between genetic  variation in the TLR10/1/6 gene cluster, TLR5, and NLRP3 loci and response to  anti-TNF treatment in RA. Changes in VAS pain and patient global scores were the  main contributors to the association found for TLR5. Furthermore, we identified  other candidate genes that require replication in independent cohorts.', 'The chromosome-centric human proteome project aims to systematically map all  human proteins, chromosome by chromosome, in a gene-centric manner through  dedicated efforts from national and international teams. This mapping will lead  to a knowledge-based resource defining the full set of proteins encoded in each  chromosome and laying the foundation for the development of a standardized  approach to analyze the massive proteomic data sets currently being generated.  The neXtProt database lists 946 proteins as the human proteome of chromosome 7.  However, 170 (18%) proteins of human chromosome 7 have no evidence at the  proteomic, antibody, or structural levels and are considered ""missing"" in this  study as they lack experimental support. We have developed a protocol for the  functional annotation of these ""missing"" proteins by integrating several  bioinformatics analysis and annotation tools, sequential BLAST homology  searches, protein domain/motif and gene ontology (GO) mapping, and Kyoto  Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes (KEGG) pathway analysis. Using the BLAST  search strategy, homologues for reviewed non-human mammalian proteins with  protein evidence were identified for 90 ""missing"" proteins while another 38 had  reviewed non-human mammalian homologues. Putative functional annotations were  assigned to 27 of the remaining 43 novel proteins. Proteotypic peptides have  been computationally generated to facilitate rapid identification of these  proteins. Four of the ""missing"" chromosome 7 proteins have been substantiated by  the ENCODE proteogenomic peptide data.', 'Infection is believed to be a leading cause of preterm premature rupture of  membranes (PPROM). The bacterial cell wall component, lipopolysaccharide (LPS),  is thought to initiate tissue responses leading to PPROM in the setting of Gram  negative infection. LPS is recognized by the innate immune system, including the  proteins encoded by the CARD15 and TLR4 genes. A recently described mutation  (2936insC) in CARD15 and a polymorphism in TLR4 896 A>G impair responses to LPS.  The objective of this study was to determine if African Americans, who have a  higher incidence of PPROM than Caucasians, have different frequencies of the  mutant CARD15 allele and the TLR4 hyporesponsive variant, and if risk of PPROM  is influenced by fetal carriage of these alleles. The allele frequencies for the  CARD15 mutation and the TLR4 896G variant in African Americans were similar to  those reported for Caucasians. There was no association between the TLR4 alleles  examined and PPROM. However, the CARD15 mutation was only detected in controls  and not in PPROM cases. We conclude that the CARD15 mutation and hyporesponsive  TLR4 allele do not contribute to ethnic variation in the incidence of PPROM.', 'The Drosophila gene Spätzle encodes the activating ligand for the Toll receptor.  This signaling pathway is required for dorso-ventral patterning in the early  embryo and an antifungal immune response in larvae and adults. The genome  sequence of Drosophila shows that there are a total of eight Toll-like receptors  and these may function in other aspects of embryonic development and innate  immunity. Here we describe five Drosophila homologues of Spätzle (Spz2-6) found  using an iterative searching method. All five appear to encode proteins  containing neurotrophin-like cystine-knot domains. In addition, most retain a  characteristic intron-exon structure shared with the prototype Spätzle gene.  This provides evidence that the family arose by ancient gene duplication events  and indicates that the gene products may represent activating ligands for  corresponding Toll receptors. Expression studies show that only Spz4 is  expressed strongly in larvae and adults and thus may be involved in an ancillary  antifungal response mediated by Toll-5. By contrast, Spz6 shows a complex  spatial and temporally regulated expression pattern in the late embryo. Thus the  new Toll/Spätzle families of signaling molecules may have important roles in  other aspects of development and immunity.', 'The Y-linked autoimmune accelerating (Yaa) locus drives the transition to fatal  lupus nephritis when combined with B6.Sle1 in our C57BL/6J (B6)-congenic model  of systemic autoimmunity. We and others recently demonstrated that the  translocation of a cluster of X-linked genes onto the Y chromosome is the  genetic lesion underlying Yaa (Subramanian, S. et al., Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci.  USA 2006. 103: 9970-9975; Pisitkun, P. et al., Science 2006. 312: 1669-1672). In  male mice carrying Yaa, the transcription of several genes within the  translocated segment is increased roughly twofold. Although the translocated X  chromosome segment in Yaa may contain as many as 16 genes, the major candidate  gene for causation of the Yaa-associated autoimmune phenotypes has been TLR7. To  confirm the role of TLR7 in Yaa-mediated autoimmune phenotypes, we introgressed  a targeted disruption of TLR7 (TLR7(-)) onto B6.Sle1Yaa to produce  B6.Sle1YaaTLR7(-) and examined evidence of disease at 6 and 9 months of age. Our  results demonstrate that the up-regulation of TLR7 in the B6.Sle1Yaa strain is  responsible for splenomegaly, glomerular nephritis and the majority of the  cellular abnormalities of B, T and myeloid cells. The up-regulation of TLR7 was  also responsible for driving the infiltration and activation of leukocytes in  the kidney, in which activated T cells were a primary component. However, the  resolution of TLR7 up-regulation did not eliminate the enhanced humoral  autoimmunity observed in B6.SleYaa, suggesting that additional elements in the  translocation may contribute to the disease phenotype.', 'Human plasmacytoid dendritic cells (pDCs) play a major role in innate immunity  through the production of type I IFNs after TLR engagement by pathogens.  Sex-based differences in the innate function of human pDCs have been  established, with pDCs from women exhibiting enhanced TLR7-mediated IFN-α  production as compared with pDCs from males. In mice, we recently provided  evidence for a role of estrogens as a positive regulator of pDC innate functions  through cell-intrinsic estrogen receptor α signaling, but did not exclude a role  for other X-linked factors, particularly in human pDCs. In this study, we  investigated the respective contribution of X chromosome dosage and sex hormones  using a humanized mouse model in which male or female NOD-SCID-β2m(-/-) were  transplanted with human progenitor cells purified from either male or female  cord blood cells. We showed that, in response to TLR7 ligands, the frequency of  IFN-α- and TNF-α-producing pDCs from either sex was greater in female than in  male host mice, suggesting a positive role for estrogens. Indeed, blockade of  estrogen receptor signaling during pDC development in vitro inhibited  TLR7-mediated IFN-α production by human pDCs, which expressed both ESR1 and ESR2  genes. Interestingly, we also found that X chromosome dosage contributed to this  sex bias as female pDCs have an enhanced TLR7-mediated IFN-α response as  compared with male ones, irrespective of the sex of the recipient mice.  Together, these results indicate that female sex hormones, estrogens, and X  chromosome complement independently contribute to the enhanced TLR7-mediated  IFN-α response of pDCs in women.', 'The y-linked autoimmune accelerating (yaa) locus is a potent autoimmune disease  allele. Transcription profiling of yaa-bearing B cells revealed the  overexpression of a cluster of X-linked genes that included Tlr7. FISH analysis  demonstrated the translocation of this segment onto the yaa chromosome. The  resulting overexpression of Tlr7 increased in vitro responses to Toll-like  receptor (TLR) 7 signaling in all yaa-bearing males. B6.yaa mice are not overtly  autoimmune, but the addition of Sle1, which contains the autoimmune-predisposing  Slam/Cd2 haplotype, causes the development of fatal lupus with numerous  immunological aberrations. B6.Sle1yaa CD4 T cells develop the molecular  signature for T(FH) cells and also show expression changes in numerous cytokines  and chemokines. Disease development and all component autoimmune phenotypes were  inhibited by Sles1, a potent suppressor locus. Sles1 had no effect on  yaa-enhanced TLR7 signaling in vitro, and these data place Sles1 downstream from  the lesion in innate immune responses mediated by TLR7, suggesting that Sles1  modulates the activation of adaptive immunity in response to innate immune  signaling.']]]",The TLR7 locus is contained in human chromosome Xp22.3.,"[{'Exact': array([32.32135561, -0.742518  , -0.51971981, -0.89951015, -2.46585021,

Which syndromes are associated with heterochromia iridum?,"[[[""We present the genetic analyses conducted on a three-generation family (14  individuals) with three members affected with isolated-Hirschsprung disease  (HSCR) and one with HSCR and heterochromia iridum (syndromic-HSCR), a phenotype  reminiscent of Waardenburg-Shah syndrome (WS4). WS4 is characterized by  pigmentary abnormalities of the skin, eyes and/or hair, sensorineural deafness  and HSCR. None of the members had sensorineural deafness. The family was  screened for copy number variations (CNVs) using Illumina-HumanOmni2.5-Beadchip  and for coding sequence mutations in WS4 genes (EDN3, EDNRB, or SOX10) and in  the main HSCR gene (RET). Confocal microscopy and immunoblotting were used to  assess the functional impact of the mutations. A heterozygous A/G transition in  EDNRB was identified in 4 affected and 3 unaffected individuals. While in EDNRB  isoforms 1 and 2 (cellular receptor) the transition results in the abolishment  of translation initiation (M1V), in isoform 3 (only in the cytosol) the  replacement occurs at Met91 (M91V) and is predicted benign. Another heterozygous  transition (c.-248G/A; -predicted to affect translation efficiency-) in the  5'-untranslated region of EDN3 (EDNRB ligand) was detected in all affected  individuals but not in healthy carriers of the EDNRB mutation. Also, a de novo  CNVs encompassing DACH1 was identified in the patient with heterochromia iridum  and HSCR Since the EDNRB and EDN3 variants only coexist in affected individuals,  HSCR could be due to the joint effect of mutations in genes of the same pathway.

The association of an arteriovenous-capillary angioma of the  ocular adnexa and ipsilateral uveal tract is a syndrome that is distinct from  Sturge-Weber syndrome.', 'We report on a boy with short stature, mental retardation, seizures, follicular  ichthyosis, generalized alopecia, hypohydrosis, enamel dysplasia, photophobia,  congenital aganglionic megacolon, inguinal hernia, vertebral, renal and other  anomalies, and a normal chromosome constitution. The clinical findings include  all the features that dermotrichic and ichthyosis  follicularis-alopecia-photophobia (IFAP) syndrome have in common and in addition  those that characterize IFAP syndrome (photophobia, recurrent respiratory  infections, etc.), those that are present only in dermotrichic syndrome (nail  anomalies, hypohydrosis, megacolon, vertebral defects, etc.) and additional ones  (enamel dysplasia, renal anomalies, inguinal hernia, etc.). Two maternal uncles  were referred as being affected by alopecia and ichthyosis suggesting X-linked  recessive transmission. Various hypotheses concerning the relationship between  the 2 syndromes and the present case are discussed.', 'McKusick-Kaufman syndrome comprises hydrometrocolpos, polydactyly, and  congenital heart defects and overlaps with Bardet-Biedl syndrome, comprising  retinitis pigmentosa, polydactyly, obesity, mental retardation, and renal and  genital anomalies. Bardet-Biedl syndrome is genetically heterogeneous with three  cloned genes ( BBS2, BBS4, and MKKS) and at least three other known loci ( BBS1,  BBS3, and BBS5). Both McKusick-Kaufman syndrome and Bardet-Biedl syndrome are  inherited in an autosomal recessive pattern, and both syndromes are caused by  mutations in the MKKS gene. However, mutations in MKKS are found in only 4%-11%  of unselected Bardet-Biedl syndrome patients. We hypothesized that an analysis  of patients with atypical Bardet-Biedl syndrome and McKusick-Kaufman syndrome  (Group I; 15 probands) and patients with Bardet-Biedl syndrome who had linkage  results inconsistent with linkage to the other loci (Group II; 12 probands)  could increase the MKKS mutation yield. Both mutant alleles were identified in  only two families in Group II. Single (heterozygous) sequence variations were  found in three Group I families and in two Group II families. Combining these  results with previously published data showed that only one mutant allele was  detected in nearly half of all patients screened to date, suggesting that  unusual mutational mechanisms or patterns of inheritance may be involved.  However, sequencing of the BBS2 gene in these patients did not provide any  evidence of digenic or ""triallelic"" inheritance. The frequency of detected  mutations in MKKS in Group II patients was 24%, i.e., six times higher than the  published rate for unselected BBS patients, suggesting that small-scale linkage  analyses may be useful in suitable families.', 'Waardenburg syndrome (WS) type I is a non-progressive auditory-pigmentary  disorder comprising congenital sensorineural hearing loss and pigmentary  disturbances of the iris, hair, and skin, along with dystopia canthorum (lateral  displacement of the inner canthi). Affected individuals may have higher risk of:  neural tube defects, cleft lip and palate, limb abnormalities, and Hirschsprung  disease. The diagnosis is clinical and should be considered if the individual  has two major or one major plus two minor criteria. PAX3 is the only known gene  associated to the syndrome. Nevertheless, its use is mostly for genetic  counseling. Regarding different diagnosis, we may list: other causes of  non-progressive auditory-pigmentary disorder comprising congenital sensorineural  hearing loss, other types of Waardenburg syndrome, piebaldism, albinism,  vitiligo and Teitz syndrome. This paper presents a case of an eleven year old  boy with deafness and ophthalmologic alterations, based on his files and exams.  It reinforced the importance of the ophthalmologist contributing for the  diagnosis of this rare systemic disease, as it includes some ophthalmologic  alterations. We remind that the early diagnosis allows adequate stimulation for  the hearing loss, as well as preventive measures in case of pregnant women  affected by genetic counseling.', 'Reporting one case of this condition type-2 with heterochromia iridis and  cochlear deafness.

This syndrome has been  mapped to bovine chromosome (BTA) 22 using a genome-wide association study with  the bovine high density single nucleotide polymorphism array. An R210I missense  mutation has been identified within microphthalmia-associated transcription  factor (MITF) as responsible for this syndrome. The mutation is located in the  highly conserved basic region of the protein and causes a negative-dominant  effect. SOX10 and PAX3 promoter binding site mutations in MITF could be ruled  out as causative for the German White Fleckvieh syndrome. Molecular  characterization of this newly detected bovine syndrome means a large animal  model is now available for the Tietz syndrome in humans.', 'The heterogeneous group of disorders known as oculocutaneous albinism (OCA)  shares cutaneous and ocular hypopigmentation associated with common  developmental abnormalities of the eye. Mutations of at least 11 loci produce  this phenotype. The majority of affected individuals develop some cutaneous  melanin; this is predominantly seen as yellow/blond hair, whereas fewer have  brown hair. The OCA phenotype is dependent on the constitutional pigmentation  background of the family, with more OCA pigmentation found in families with  darker constitutional pigmentation, which indicates that other genes may modify  the OCA phenotype. Sequence variation in the melanocortin-1 receptor (MC1R) gene  is associated with red hair in the normal population, but red hair is unusual in  OCA. We identified eight probands with OCA who had red hair at birth. Mutations  in the P gene were responsible for classic phenotype of oculocutaneous albinism  type 2 (OCA2) in all eight, and mutations in the MC1R gene were responsible for  the red (rather than yellow/blond) hair in the six of eight who continued to  have red hair after birth. This is the first demonstration of a gene modifying  the OCA phenotype in humans.']]]","The syndromes associated with heterochromia iridum mentioned in the context are:

List the components of mTOR Complex 2 (mTORC2).,"[[['Mammalian Sin1 plays key roles in the regulation of mitogen-activated protein  kinase (MAPK) and mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR) signaling. Sin1 is an  essential component of mTOR complex 2 (mTORC2). The functions of Sin1 and mTORC2  remain largely unknown in T cells. Here, we investigate Sin1 function in T cells  using mice that lack Sin1 in the hematopoietic system. Sin1 deficiency blocks  the mTORC2-dependent Akt phosphorylation in T cells during development and  activation. Sin1-deficient T cells exhibit normal thymic cellularity and  percentages of double-negative, double-positive, and single-positive CD4(+) and  CD8(+) thymocytes. Sin1 deficiency does not impair T-cell receptor (TCR) induced  growth and proliferation. Sin1 appears dispensable for in vitro CD4(+) helper  cell differentiation. However, Sin1 deficiency results in an increased  proportion of Foxp3(+) natural T-regulatory (nTreg) cells in the thymus. The  TGF-β-dependent differentiation of CD4(+) T cells in vitro is enhanced by the  inhibition of mTOR but not by loss of Sin1 function. Our results reveal that  Sin1 and mTORC2 are dispensable for the development and activation of T cells  but play a role in nTreg-cell differentiation.', 'When rhegmatogenous retinal detachment occurs, tumor necrosis factor-alpha  (TNF-α) among other cytokines leaks into the subretinal space, induces resident  retinal pigment epithelial (RPE) cells to migrate, which is the initial step of  proliferative vitreoretinopathy (PVR). In the current study, we aim to  understand how this is regulated by focusing the cellular mechanisms involved.  Here we identified an Akt/Tuberous sclerosis protein 2 (TSC2)/mTOR complex1  (mTORC1) signaling pathway after TNF-α treatment to mediate RPE cell migration.  Suppression of mTORC1 activation, either by its inhibitor rapamycin, or by  activation of its suppressor AMP activated protein kinase (AMPK), inhibited  TNF-α-mediated RPE cell migration, while RNA interference (RNAi)-mediated  knocking-down of SIN1 or Rictor, two key components of mTOR complex 2 (mTORC2),  had no significant effect on TNF-α-induced RPE cell migration. Our data provide  initial evidence that TNF-α-mediated in vitro RPE cell migration mainly requires  Akt/mTORC1, but not mTORC2 signaling. The results of this study may lead to  indentify novel signaling targets against PVR.', 'Protein synthesis regulation via mammalian target of rapamycin complex 1  (mTORC1) signaling pathway has key roles in neural development and function, and  its dysregulation is involved in neurodevelopmental disorders associated with  autism and intellectual disability. mTOR regulates assembly of the translation  initiation machinery by interacting with the eukaryotic initiation factor eIF3  complex and by controlling phosphorylation of key translational regulators.  Collybistin (CB), a neuron-specific Rho-GEF responsible for X-linked  intellectual disability with epilepsy, also interacts with eIF3, and its binding  partner gephyrin associates with mTOR. Therefore, we hypothesized that CB also  binds mTOR and affects mTORC1 signaling activity in neuronal cells. Here, by  using induced pluripotent stem cell-derived neural progenitor cells from a male  patient with a deletion of entire CB gene and from control individuals, as well  as a heterologous expression system, we describe that CB physically interacts  with mTOR and inhibits mTORC1 signaling pathway and protein synthesis. These  findings suggest that disinhibited mTORC1 signaling may also contribute to the  pathological process in patients with loss-of-function variants in CB.', 'Tuberous sclerosis complex (TSC) is a multisystem genetic disorder with severe  neurologic manifestations, including epilepsy, autism, anxiety and attention  deficit hyperactivity disorder. TSC is caused by the loss of either the TSC1 or  TSC2 genes that normally regulate the mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR)  kinase. mTOR exists within two distinct complexes, mTOR complex 1 (mTORC1) and  mTOR complex 2 (mTORC2). Loss of either TSC gene leads to increased mTORC1 but  decreased mTORC2 signaling. As the contribution of decreased mTORC2 signaling to  neural development and homeostasis has not been well studied, we generated a  conditional knockout (CKO) of Rictor, a key component of mTORC2. mTORC2  signaling is impaired in the brain, whereas mTORC1 signaling is unchanged.  Rictor CKO mice have small brains and bodies, normal lifespan and are fertile.  Cortical layering is normal, but neurons are smaller than those in control  brains. Seizures were not observed, although excessive slow activity was seen on  electroencephalography. Rictor CKO mice are hyperactive and have reduced  anxiety-like behavior. Finally, there is decreased white matter and increased  levels of monoamine neurotransmitters in the cerebral cortex. Loss of mTORC2  signaling in the cortex independent of mTORC1 can disrupt normal brain  development and function and may contribute to some of the neurologic  manifestations seen in TSC.', ""The mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR) is part of two distinct complexes,  mTORC1, containing raptor and mLST8, and mTORC2, containing rictor, mLST8 and  sin1. Although great endeavors have already been made to elucidate the function  and regulation of mTOR, the cytoplasmic nuclear distribution of the mTOR  complexes is unknown. Upon establishment of the proper experimental conditions,  we found mTOR, mLST8, rictor and sin1 to be less abundant in the nucleus than in  the cytoplasm of non-transformed, non-immortalized, diploid human primary  fibroblasts. Although raptor is also high abundant in the nucleus, the  mTOR/raptor complex is predominantly cytoplasmic, whereas the mTOR/rictor  complex is abundant in both compartments. Rapamycin negatively regulates the  formation of both mTOR complexes, but the molecular mechanism of its effects on  mTORC2 remained elusive. We describe that in primary cells short-term treatment  with rapamycin triggers dephosphorylation of rictor and sin1 exclusively in the  cytoplasm, but does not affect mTORC2 assembly. Prolonged drug treatment leads  to complete dephosphorylation and cytoplasmic translocation of nuclear rictor  and sin1 accompanied by inhibition of mTORC2 assembly. The distinct cytoplasmic  and nuclear upstream and downstream effectors of mTOR are involved in many  cancers and human genetic diseases, such as tuberous sclerosis, Peutz-Jeghers  syndrome, von Hippel-Lindau disease, neurofibromatosis type 1, polycystic kidney  disease, Alzheimer's disease, cardiac hypertrophy, obesity and diabetes.  Accordingly, analogs of rapamycin are currently tested in many different  clinical trials. Our data allow new insights into the molecular consequences of  mTOR dysregulation under pathophysiological conditions and should help to  optimize rapamycin treatment of human diseases."", 'mTOR complex 2 (mTORC2) signaling is upregulated in multiple types of human  cancer, but the molecular mechanisms underlying its activation and regulation  remain elusive. Here, we show that microRNA-mediated upregulation of Rictor, an  mTORC2-specific component, contributes to tumor progression. Rictor is  upregulated via the repression of the miR-424/503 cluster in human prostate and  colon cancer cell lines that harbor c-Src upregulation and in Src-transformed  cells. The tumorigenicity and invasive activity of these cells were suppressed  by re-expression of miR-424/503. Rictor upregulation promotes formation of  mTORC2 and induces activation of mTORC2, resulting in promotion of tumor growth  and invasion. Furthermore, downregulation of miR-424/503 is associated with  Rictor upregulation in colon cancer tissues. These findings suggest that the  miR-424/503-Rictor pathway plays a crucial role in tumor progression.', 'Mutations in either the TSC1 or TSC2 tumor suppressor gene are responsible for  Tuberous Sclerosis Complex. The gene products of TSC1 and TSC2 form a functional  complex and inhibit the phosphorylation of S6K and 4EBP1, two key regulators of  translation. Here, we describe that TSC2 is regulated by cellular energy levels  and plays an essential role in the cellular energy response pathway. Under  energy starvation conditions, the AMP-activated protein kinase (AMPK)  phosphorylates TSC2 and enhances its activity. Phosphorylation of TSC2 by AMPK  is required for translation regulation and cell size control in response to  energy deprivation. Furthermore, TSC2 and its phosphorylation by AMPK protect  cells from energy deprivation-induced apoptosis. These observations demonstrate  a model where TSC2 functions as a key player in regulation of the common mTOR  pathway of protein synthesis, cell growth, and viability in response to cellular  energy levels.', 'Tuberous sclerosis complex 1 (TSC1) and TSC2 are suppressors of mechanistic  target of rapamycin (mTOR). mTOR is the major component of two protein  complexes: mTOR complex 1 (mTORC1) and mTORC2. Inactive mutation of either TSC1  or TSC2 unleashes mTOR signaling and consequently causes TSC, a benign tumor  syndrome affecting multiple organs. We report here that expression of  αB-crystallin was upregulated in Tsc1-/- or Tsc2-/- mouse embryonic fibroblasts,  Eker rat uterine leiomyoma-derived Tsc2-deficient ELT3 cells, mutant  Tsc2-associated mouse kidney tumors, and human lung lymphangioleiomyomatosis  nodules. αB-crystallin was transcriptionally activated by mTOR complex 2  (mTORC2): nuclear factor-kappa B (NFκB) signaling cascade. The augmented  αB-crystallin was critical for the migration, invasion and apoptotic resistance  of Tsc2-defective cells. Disruption of αB-crystallin suppressed Tsc2-null cell  proliferation and tumorigenesis. Therefore, enhanced αB-crystallin has an  essential role in TSC1/2 complex deficiency-mediated tumorigenesis, and  inhibition of αB-crystallin may complement the current therapy for TSC.', 'Tuberous sclerosis complex (TSC) is a genetic disease caused by a mutation in  either the tsc1 or tsc2 tumor suppressor gene. Recent studies have demonstrated  that TSC2 displays GAP (GTPase-activating protein) activity specifically towards  the small G protein Rheb and inhibits its ability to stimulate the mTOR  signaling pathway. Rheb and TSC2 comprise a unique pair of GTPase and GAP,  because Rheb has high basal GTP levels and TSC2 does not have the catalytic  arginine finger found in Ras-GAP. To investigate the function of TSC2 and Rheb  in mTOR signaling, we analyzed the TSC2-stimulated Rheb GTPase activity. We  found that Arg15, a residue equivalent to Gly12 in Ras, is important for Rheb to  function as a substrate for TSC2 GAP. In addition, we identified asparagine  residues essential for TSC2 GAP activity. We demonstrated a novel catalytic  mechanism of the TSC2 GAP and Rheb that TSC2 uses a catalytic ""asparagine thumb""  instead of the arginine finger found in Ras-GAP. Furthermore, we discovered that  farnesylation and membrane localization of Rheb is not essential for Rheb to  stimulate S6 kinase (S6K) phosphorylation. Analysis of TSC1 binding defective  mutants of TSC2 shows that TSC1 is not required for the TSC2 GAP activity but  may function as a regulatory component in the TSC1/TSC2 complex. Our data  further demonstrate that GAP activity is essential for the cellular function of  TSC2 to inhibit S6K phosphorylation.', 'Mutations that inactivate either TSC1 or TSC2 cause tuberous sclerosis. We have  used immunoblotting and immunohistochemical analysis to see whether there is  phosphorylation of p70 S6 kinase, and the ribosomal S6 protein in  angiomyolipomas occurring in tuberous scierosis. Hamartin (encoded by TSC1) and  S6K was expressed in all samples. Tuberin (TSC2) was weak or absent in  angiomyolipomas, but present in healthy kidney, whereas, phosphorylated p70 S6  kinase and p56 were present only in angiomyolipomas. Our results indicate  activation of a mammalian target of rapamycin metabolic pathway in tuberous  sclerosis lesions, which contributes to their growth. We suggest that treatment  with rapamycin and its analogues could benefit such patients.']]]","The components of mTOR Complex 2 (mTORC2) include:

What is known about prostate cancer screening in the UK ?,"[[[""OBJECTIVE: To evaluate the psychosocial impact of participation in a  population-based prostate-specific antigen (PSA) testing programme, akin to  screening, and to explore the relationship between urinary symptoms reported  before PSA testing and the response to the subsequent PSA result. PATIENTS AND METHODS: This prospective questionnaire study was nested within the  case-finding component of the ProtecT (prostate testing for cancer and  treatment) feasibility study (ISRCTN20141297). Men aged 50-69 years from 18  general practices in three cities in the UK completed the Hospital Anxiety and  Depression Scale (HADS), the Short Form-12 (SF-12) Health Survey, and the  International Continence Society 'male' (ICSmale) questionnaires before giving  consent for a PSA test in a community clinic (baseline). Men with an 'abnormal'  PSA result returned for further investigation (including biopsy) and repeated  these questionnaires before biopsy. RESULTS: At baseline, study participants had similar levels of anxiety and  depression to the general male population. There was no increase in the HADS  scores, or reduction in the SF-12 mental health component summary score, on  attendance at the biopsy clinic after receiving an 'abnormal' PSA result.  Urinary symptoms were associated with levels of anxiety and depression before  receiving a PSA result (baseline), but were not associated with anxiety and  depression at biopsy independently of baseline scores. Therefore changes in  anxiety or depression at biopsy did not appear to differ between those with and  without urinary symptoms. CONCLUSIONS: This study confirms the findings of other studies that the  deleterious effects of receiving an abnormal PSA result during population  screening are not identified by generic health-status questionnaires.  Comparisons with outcomes of studies measuring cancer-specific distress and  using qualitative research methods raise the question of whether a prostate  cancer screening-specific instrument is required. However, a standardized  measure of anxiety identified differences at baseline between those who did and  did not report urinary symptoms. These findings suggest that it might be  advisable to better inform men undergoing PSA testing about the uncertain  relationship between urinary symptoms and prostate cancer, to minimize baseline  levels of psychological distress."", ""BACKGROUND: Web-based decision aids are known to have an effect on knowledge,  attitude, and behavior; important components of informed decision making. We  know what decision aids achieve in randomized controlled trials (RCTs), but we  still know very little about how they are used and how this relates to the  informed decision making outcome measures. OBJECTIVE: To examine men's use of an online decision aid for prostate cancer  screening using website transaction log files (web-logs), and to examine  associations between usage and components of informed decision making. METHODS: We conducted an observational web-log analysis of users of an online  decision aid, Prosdex. Men between 50 and 75 years of age were recruited for an  associated RCT from 26 general practices across South Wales, United Kingdom. Men  allocated to one arm of the RCT were included in the current study. Time and  usage data were derived from website log files. Components of informed decision  making were measured by an online questionnaire. RESULTS: Available for analysis were 82 web-logs. Overall, there was large  variation in the use of Prosdex. The mean total time spent on the site was 20  minutes. The mean number of pages accessed was 32 (SD 21) out of a possible 60  pages. Significant associations were found between increased usage and increased  knowledge (Spearman rank correlation [rho] = 0.69, P < .01), between increased  usage and less favorable attitude towards PSA testing (rho = -0.52, P < .01),  and between increased usage and reduced intention to undergo PSA testing (rho =  -0.44, P < .01). A bimodal distribution identified two types of user: low access  and high access users. CONCLUSIONS: Increased usage of Prosdex leads to more informed decision making,  the key aim of the UK Prostate Cancer Risk Management Programme. However,  developers realistically have roughly 20 minutes to provide useful information  that will support informed decision making when the patient uses a web-based  interface. Future decision aids need to be developed with this limitation in  mind. We recommend that web-log analysis should be an integral part of online  decision aid development and analysis. TRIAL REGISTRATION: ISRCTN48473735;  http://www.controlled-trials.com/ISRCTN48473735 (Archived by WebCite at  http://www.webcitation.org/5pqeF89tS)."", ""OBJECTIVE: To explore the concerns and worries in men with uncomplicated lower  urinary tract symptoms (LUTS, but no evidence of prostate cancer) relating to  their symptoms. PATIENTS AND METHODS: There is no current prostate cancer screening programme in  the UK. Evidence suggests that men with LUTS have the same risk of prostate  cancer as aged-matched asymptomatic men. However, most men with LUTS are  'screened' with a digital rectal examination (DRE) and prostate specific antigen  (PSA) testing as part of routine assessment. Whether this screening offers any  benefit to patients and whether national screening for prostate cancer and  subsequent early treatment offer any long-term survival or quality of life  benefit is uncertain. Thus 30 men with uncomplicated LUTS were qualitatively  interviewed to explore their concerns and worries about their symptoms.  Interviews were transcribed verbatim and subjected to content analysis using  validated techniques. RESULTS: Of the 30 men, 22 (73%) expressed a fear of prostate cancer at the time  of their initial presentation. This fear was independent of race, social class  and symptom severity; older men were less worried. Of the 22, 15 (68%) stated  that after reassurance their symptoms were less bothersome and easier to cope  with. CONCLUSIONS: These findings suggest there is a considerable gain in health by  explicitly addressing the concerns of prostate cancer in men with uncomplicated  LUTS. Informing these men of their true risk of prostate cancer (before or after  a DRE and PSA estimate) may alleviate much of the bother associated with their  symptoms. Despite no evidence of any greater risk of prostate cancer than in  asymptomatic men, symptomatic men should continue to be screened after  appropriate counselling."", 'We used a nested case-control design on data from men in four prospective  studies (from the UK, Maryland in the USA, and two from Finland) with available  stored serum samples to determine whether there was an advantage in measuring  both free prostate-specific antigen (PSA) and total PSA as a potential screening  test for prostate cancer. Of these men, 247 were verified through national vital  statistics offices as having died of prostate cancer, or having developed the  disease, and 953 men who did not develop prostate cancer (controls) were  selected, matched to cases for age, study centre and sample storage duration.  Fixing the false-positive rate at 1%, the prostate cancer detection rate  (sensitivity) over the 3 years following serum collection (based on 14 cancers)  increased from an estimated 95% using total PSA to 97% using free and bound PSA  (that is, bound to alpha-antichymotrypsin which together with the free form is  total PSA). Over a 6-year period (based on 41 cancers) a similar difference  occurred (52% and 56% detection rates respectively). We conclude that there is  no material advantage in adding free to total PSA in prostate cancer screening  trials.', ""INTRODUCTION: Screening for prostate cancer with serum prostate specific antigen  (PSA) remains a controversial topic. The UK NHS Executive has issued extensive  guidance stressing the importance of adequate counselling prior to performing  this test. This study aims to assess men's knowledge of the PSA test at the time  of their referral and their attitude towards screening. PATIENTS AND METHODS: A total of 219 men referred to urology via the 'fast  track' prostate cancer service were recruited into the study. Of these, 191 were  referred from primary care and 28 from secondary care. All men completed a  questionnaire regarding their knowledge and expectation of the test. RESULTS: The response rate for completed questionnaires was 100%. Overall, 91  (41.5%) men were aware that their PSA had been performed prior to referral and  only 79 (36%) men understood why the test was being done. Patients referred from  secondary care appeared to be better informed. Despite these figures, 175 (80%)  men said they would recommend PSA testing to a friend or colleague, and 196  (89%) men said the test should be broadly publicised. CONCLUSIONS: Nearly two-thirds of the men referred to urology with an elevated  PSA were unaware that they had even had their PSA done. Information about the  limitations of PSA testing and the consequence of a positive test result had  been deficient. Informed counselling for the PSA test should form part of the  consultation of any physician intending to undertake this test whether for lower  urinary tract symptoms or for prostate cancer screening."", ""INTRODUCTION: Information on prostate diseases, including prostate cancer, has  been promoted by the Association Française d'Urologie (AFU) for several years,  but is developing slowly in France. In 2005, a first communication was targeted  to the male public and identified the reasons for the fatalistic attitude of  men, and paradoxically, why the prostate incarnates the vulnerability of their  sexual capital. As part of a second phase, this article presents the results of  a complementary study conducted among general practitioners to identify their  expectations and the most appropriate levers to promote screening. MATERIAL AND METHOD: The Ipsos survey company developed a Krisis qualitative  protocol in October 2005 (after the first French prostate day on 15 September  2005). Three groups of general practitioners were defined: doctors who are very  active in terms of screening, doctors who are uncomfortable with this problem  and doctors who systematically refer their patients to urologists. RESULTS: The management of prostate diseases often highlights the ageing process  for the patient. The ability to discuss these problems during the consultation  depended on the doctor's degree of comfort with this subject, which is related  to his/her training and relationships with urologists. To initiate the question  of screening, general practitioners involved in this process asked simple  questions about everyday practices without being afraid of making jokes or  basing their approach on mediatization of the disease. Digital rectal  examination is one of the important clinical elements but is not always easy to  perform. PSA was found to be an examination that is not always appropriate,  characterized by a lack of information on the conditions for ordering this test,  its usefulness and its relevance for screening. Ultrasound could be a way of  alerting the patient without dramatizing the situation, letting the urologist  perform digital rectal examination. Female general practitioners preferred PSA  and ultrasound. The doctors surveyed relied on mediatization of prostate  diseases, a high level of interactivity with urologists and documents and  brochures to be placed in waiting rooms to relay screening messages. CONCLUSION: General practitioners need their authorities, specialists and public  health institutions to develop and mediatize andrology in the same way as  gynaecology. Urologists play a major supportive role by means of conferences,  postgraduate training or AFU invitations."", 'OBJECTIVE: To evaluate the role of targeted prostate cancer screening in men  with BRCA1 or BRCA2 mutations, an international study, IMPACT (Identification of  Men with a genetic predisposition to ProstAte Cancer: Targeted screening in  BRCA1/2 mutation carriers and controls), was established. This is the first  multicentre screening study targeted at men with a known genetic predisposition  to prostate cancer. A preliminary analysis of the data is reported. PATIENTS AND METHODS: Men aged 40-69 years from families with BRCA1 or BRCA2  mutations were offered annual prostate specific antigen (PSA) testing, and those  with PSA > 3 ng/mL, were offered a prostate biopsy. Controls were men  age-matched (± 5 years) who were negative for the familial mutation. RESULTS: In total, 300 men were recruited (205 mutation carriers; 89 BRCA1, 116  BRCA2 and 95 controls) over 33 months. At the baseline screen (year 1), 7.0%  (21/300) underwent a prostate biopsy. Prostate cancer was diagnosed in ten  individuals, a prevalence of 3.3%. The positive predictive value of PSA  screening in this cohort was 47·6% (10/21). One prostate cancer was diagnosed at  year 2. Of the 11 prostate cancers diagnosed, nine were in mutation carriers,  two in controls, and eight were clinically significant. CONCLUSIONS: The present study shows that the positive predictive value of PSA  screening in BRCA mutation carriers is high and that screening detects  clinically significant prostate cancer. These results support the rationale for  continued screening in such men.', 'We used a nested case-control design on data from men in four prospective  studies (from the UK, Maryland in the USA, and two from Finland) with available  stored serum samples to determine whether there was an advantage in measuring  both free prostate-specific antigen (PSA) and total PSA as a potential screening  test for prostate cancer. Of these men, 247 were verified through national vital  statistics offices as having died of prostate cancer, or having developed the  disease, and 953 men who did not develop prostate cancer (controls) were  selected, matched to cases for age, study centre and sample storage duration.  Fixing the false-positive rate at 1%, the prostate cancer detection rate  (sensitivity) over the 3 years following serum collection (based on 14 cancers)  increased from an estimated 95% using total PSA to 97% using free and bound PSA  (that is, bound to alpha-antichymotrypsin which together with the free form is  total PSA). Over a 6-year period (based on 41 cancers) a similar difference  occurred (52% and 56% detection rates respectively). We conclude that there is  no material advantage in adding free to total PSA in prostate cancer screening  trials.', 'BACKGROUND: Prostate cancer screening with prostate-specific antigen (PSA) has  shown to reduce prostate cancer mortality in the European Randomised study of  Screening for Prostate Cancer (ERSPC) trial. Overdetection and overtreatment are  substantial unfavourable side effects with consequent healthcare costs. In this  study the effects of introducing widespread PSA screening is evaluated. METHODS: The MISCAN model was used to simulate prostate cancer growth and  detection in a simulated cohort of 100,000 men (European standard population)  over 25 years. PSA screening from age 55 to 70 or 75, with 1, 2 and  4-year-intervals is simulated. Number of diagnoses, PSA tests, biopsies,  treatments, deaths and corresponding costs for 100,000 men and for United  Kingdom and United States are compared. RESULTS: Without screening 2378 men per 100,000 were predicted to be diagnosed  with prostate cancer compared with 4956 men after screening at 4-year intervals.  By introducing screening, the costs would increase with 100% to 60,695,000 euro.  Overdetection is related to 39% of total costs (23,669,000 euro). Screening  until age 75 is relatively most expensive because of the costs of overtreatment. CONCLUSION: Introduction of PSA screening will increase total healthcare costs  for prostate cancer substantially, of which the actual screening costs will be a  small part.', 'OBJECTIVES: To evaluate the relevance of demographic, physician, and  psychological characteristics to PSA screening in ethnic subpopulations and  ascertain whether the same characteristics distinguish men who have never had a  PSA from those who screen infrequently and those who screen yearly (adhere). DESIGN AND METHODS: Stratified cluster-sampling was used to recruit 533 men  (45-70 years) from four ethnic groups: African-American; European-American;  immigrant Jamaican; and immigrant men from Trinidad and Tobago. Men provided  demographic and structural (insurance, regular physician, annual exam, and  physician recommendation), cognitive (risk and efficacy perceptions, knowledge),  and emotional variables (cancer worry and embarrassment), and reported on PSA  screening history. Multinomial logistic regression used these variables to  predict three screening classifications (never screened, partially adherent, and  adherent). RESULTS: Multinomial logistic regression showed that minority men were less  likely to report either never screening or yearly screening, while younger men  were more likely. Lack of a regular physician (OR=2.87, 95% CI 1.39-5.84), an  annual exam (OR=1.73, 95% CI 0.91-3.28), and low recommendation (OR=3.76, 95% CI  2.13-6.66) were associated with being categorized as a never (vs. partially  adherent) screener, but only annual exam (OR=0.26, 95% CI 0.10-0.63) was  associated with yearly screening. Lower cancer worry was marginally associated  with never screening (OR=0.59, 95% CI 0.38-1.04), while knowledge was associated  with screening yearly over time (OR=0.46, 95% CI 0.28-0.77). CONCLUSIONS: Demographic, physician, and psychological variables are  differentially associated with never, less than yearly, and yearly screening  classifications. Minority men were unlikely to have never screened, but were  also less likely to screen yearly. Physician variables were associated with the  difference between not screening and partially adherent, but not between  partially adherent and yearly screening suggesting that the role of physicians  in PSA behaviour over time would benefit from further study.']]]","In the UK, there is a population-based prostate-specific antigen (PSA) testing program, akin to screening, which was evaluated. The study found that men participating in this program did not experience increased anxiety or depression levels, nor did their health status scores decrease, after receiving an ""abnormal"" PSA result. However, urinary symptoms were associated with higher anxiety and depression levels before the PSA result, but this association did not persist after the biopsy. The study also noted that there is no clear benefit in adding free to total PSA in prostate cancer screening trials. Additionally, the introduction of PSA screening in the UK would increase total healthcare costs for prostate cancer substantially, mainly due to the costs of overtreatment.","[{'Exact': array([ 1.69511432e+02,  3.34062028e-01, -3.89039956e+00,  1.98377639e+01,

Is selenium deficiency involved in autoimmune thyroid disease?,"[[[""It is well known that selenium plays a fundamental role in regulating thyroid  and other functions of the human body like reproduction, autoimmunity, glucose  metabolism or bone metabolism. While for thyroid function investigation,  radioimmunoassays and radioimmunometric assays both key techniques of nuclear  medicine are used, for selenium measurements atomic absorption spectrometry is  the method of choice. Normal thyroid gland retains high selenium concentrations  even under conditions of inadequate selenium supply and expresses many of the  known selenocysteine-containing proteins. Adequate selenium nutrition supports  efficient thyroid hormone synthesis and metabolism and protects the thyroid  gland damage by excessive iodide exposure. In regions where a combined severe  iodine and selenium deficiency exist, normalization of iodine supply is  mandatory before initiation of selenium supplementation in order to prevent  hypothyroidism. Selenium deficiency and disturbed thyroid function may develop  under conditions of special dietary regimens, such as long-term total parenteral  nutrition or after inadequate nutrition in children. Some investigators suggest  that selenium may be a useful adjunctive treatment for autoimmune thyroid  diseases, such as Hashimoto and Graves' disease. Low serum selenium levels have  been associated with higher incidence of thyroid cancer, as well as with chronic  illness or lomicronw triiodothyronine syndrome. These biological actions are  mediated through the expression of selenoproteins, the most important being the  glutathione peroxidases, the iodothyronine deiodinases, the thioredoxine  reductase and the selenoprotein P. Selenium is also associated with animal  proteins. Subsequently meats and seafood are dietary sources of selenium. The  ingestion of large quantities of selenium may have adverse effects. It has been  shown that dietary intake of about 300 micro g of selenium daily may have a  toxic effect on growth hormone and insulin like growth factor-1 metabolism, as  well as in the synthesis of thyroid hormones. Main adverse effects may be  anorexia, diarrhea, depression, hemorrhage, liver and kidney necrosis,  blindness, ataxia and respiratory disturbances.

OBJECTIVE: To compare serum selenium (s-Se) values in patients with newly  diagnosed autoimmune thyroid disease and controls from the Danish population. DESIGN AND SETTINGS: S-Se was measured in triplicate by a fluorimetric method. PARTICIPANTS: Patients with newly diagnosed Graves' disease (GD) (n\xa0=\xa097) or  autoimmune overt hypothyroidism (AIH) (n\xa0=\xa096), euthyroid subjects with high  serum levels of thyroid peroxidase antibody (TPO-Ab) (TPO-Ab >\xa01500\xa0U/ml,  n\xa0=\xa092) and random controls (n\xa0=\xa0830). MAIN OUTCOME MEASURE: Differences in s-Se values. RESULTS: S-Se was lower in patients with GD than in controls (mean (SD), GD:  89·9\xa0μg/l (18·4); controls: 98·8\xa0μg/l (19·7), P\xa0<\xa00·01). This was confirmed in a  multivariate logistic regression model adjusting for age, sex, mineral  supplements, smoking, geographical region and time of sampling (P\xa0<\xa00·01). In a  linear model, s-Se was similar in patients with AIH (mean (SD): 98·4\xa0μg/l  (24·9)) and in controls (P\xa0=\xa00·86). In the multivariate model however, s-Se was  marginally lower in patients with AIH compared to controls (P\xa0=\xa00·04). There was  no significant difference in s-Se between euthyroid participants with high  TPO-Ab and random controls (linear: P\xa0=\xa00·97; multivariate: P\xa0=\xa00·27). CONCLUSION: Patients with newly diagnosed GD and AIH had significantly lower  s-Se compared with random controls. Our observation supports the postulated link  between inadequate selenium supply and overt autoimmune thyroid disease,  especially GD."", ""Mammalian selenium-containing proteins identified thus far contain selenium in  the form of a selenocysteine residue encoded by UGA. These proteins lack common  amino acid sequence motifs, but 3'-untranslated regions of selenoprotein genes  contain a common stem-loop structure, selenocysteine insertion sequence (SECIS)  element, that is necessary for decoding UGA as selenocysteine rather than a stop  signal. We describe here a computer program, SECISearch, that identifies  mammalian selenoprotein genes by recognizing SECIS elements on the basis of  their primary and secondary structures and free energy requirements. When  SECISearch was applied to search human dbEST, two new mammalian selenoproteins,  designated SelT and SelR, were identified. We determined their cDNA sequences  and expressed them in a monkey cell line as fusion proteins with a green  fluorescent protein. Incorporation of selenium into new proteins was confirmed  by metabolic labeling with (75)Se, and expression of SelT was additionally  documented in immunoblot assays. SelT and SelR did not have homology to  previously characterized proteins, but their putative homologs were detected in  various organisms. SelR homologs were present in every organism characterized by  complete genome sequencing. The data suggest applicability of SECISearch for  identification of new selenoprotein genes in nucleotide data bases."", 'High prevalence of hyperplastic and autoimmune diseases of thyroid in Ukrainian  population is determined by endemic deficit of iodine and selenium. The aim of  this research was to assess the place of biologically-active additions on the  basis of herbal material containing an iodine and selenium in prophylaxis and  treatment of thyroid pathology. During the six month period 55 patients received  herbal preparation Alba twice a day. The levels of TSH, volume of thyroid, the  sizes of nodular goiter (ultrasound investigation) were measured before and at  the end of the investigation. The levels of thyroid stimulating antibodies to  TSH receptor (AB-r TSH) were evaluated in patients with hyperthyroidism. The  results of Alba application showed that in patients with thyroid pathology  (diffuse nontoxic goiter, hyperthyroidism and chronic thyroiditis) it was  possible to reduce the volume of thyroid, normalize its function, and decrease  the level of AB-r TSH in diffuse toxic goiter. We also found approximately 20 %  shortening of the time needed to get target level of TSH and finally the  duration of treatment of thyrotoxicosis.', 'BACKGROUND/OBJECTIVES: Selenium was thought to have a role in cardiovascular  disease (CVD) owing to its antioxidant properties; however, evidence from  observational studies and randomized controlled trials (RCTs) has been  inconsistent and controversial. We thus conducted a meta-analysis to assess the  discrepancies between observational and randomized trial evidence. SUBJECTS/METHODS: We searched MEDLINE and EMBASE for eligible prospective  studies regarding the relationship between selenium and CVD up to 15 December  2013 and finally included 16 prospective observational studies and 16 RCTs.  Random effects model was used to estimate the pooled relative risk (RR).  Generalized least-squares trend test and restricted cubic spline model were  performed to assess a linear and a nonlinear dose-response relationship. RESULTS: Our meta-analysis of prospective studies showed a nonlinear  relationship of CVD risk with blood selenium concentrations across a range of  30-165\u2009μg/l and a significant benefit of CVD within a narrow selenium range of  55-145\u2009μg/l. Our meta-analyses of RCTs showed that oral selenium supplements  (median dose: 200\u2009μg/day) for 2 weeks to 144 months significantly raised the  blood selenium concentrations by 56.4\u2009μg/l (95% confidence interval (CI): 40.9,  72.0\u2009μg/l), whereas oral selenium supplements (median: 100\u2009μg/day) for 6 to 114  months caused no effect on CVD (RR=0.91; 95% CI: 0.74, 1.10). CONCLUSIONS: Our meta-analysis in prospective studies demonstrated a significant  inverse association between selenium status and CVD risk within a narrow  selenium range and a null effect of selenium supplementation on CVD was observed  in RCTs. These findings indicate the importance of considering selenium status,  dose and safety in health assessment and future study design.', 'The micronutrient selenium is found in proteins as selenocysteine (Sec), the  21st amino acid cotranslationally inserted in response to a UGA codon. In vitro  studies in archaea and mouse showed that Sec-tRNA(Sec) formation is a 3-step  process starting with serylation of tRNA(Sec) by seryl-tRNA synthetase (SerRS),  phosphorylation of serine to form phosphoserine (Sep)-tRNA(Sec) by  phosphoseryl-tRNA(Sec) kinase (PSTK), and conversion to Sec-tRNA(Sec) by  Sep-tRNA:Sec-tRNA synthase (SepSecS). However, a complete study of eukaryotic  selenoprotein synthesis has been lacking. Here, we present an analysis of  Sec-tRNA(Sec) formation in the parasitic protozoon Trypanosoma brucei in vivo.  Null mutants of either PSTK or SepSecS abolished selenoprotein synthesis,  demonstrating the essentiality of both enzymes for Sec-tRNA(Sec) formation.  Growth of the 2 knockout strains was not impaired; thus, unlike mammals,  trypanosomes do not require selenoproteins for viability. Analysis of  conditional RNAi strains showed that SerRS, selenophosphate synthase, and the  Sec-specific elongation factor, EFSec, are also essential for selenoprotein  synthesis. These results with T. brucei imply that eukaryotes have a single  pathway of Sec-tRNA(Sec) synthesis that requires Sep-tRNA(Sec) as an  intermediate.', 'The trace element selenium is an essential micronutrient that is required for  the biosynthesis of selenocysteine-containing selenoproteins. Most of the known  selenoproteins are expressed in the thyroid gland, including some with still  unknown functions. Among the well-characterized selenoproteins are the  iodothyronine deiodinases, glutathione peroxidases and thioredoxin reductases,  enzymes involved in thyroid hormone metabolism, regulation of redox state and  protection from oxidative damage. Selenium content in selenium-sensitive tissues  such as the liver, kidney or muscle and expression of nonessential  selenoproteins, such as the glutathione peroxidases GPx1 and GPx3, is controlled  by nutritional supply. The thyroid gland is, however, largely independent from  dietary selenium intake and thyroid selenoproteins are preferentially expressed.  As a consequence, no explicit effects on thyroid hormone profiles are observed  in healthy individuals undergoing selenium supplementation. However, low  selenium status correlates with risk of goiter and multiple nodules in European  women. Some clinical studies have demonstrated that selenium-deficient patients  with autoimmune thyroid disease benefit from selenium supplementation, although  the data are conflicting and many parameters must still be defined. The baseline  selenium status of an individual could constitute the most important parameter  modifying the outcome of selenium supplementation, which might primarily disrupt  self-amplifying cycles of the endocrine-immune system interface rectifying the  interaction of lymphocytes with thyroid autoantigens. Selenium deficiency is  likely to constitute a risk factor for a feedforward derangement of the immune  system-thyroid interaction, while selenium supplementation appears to dampen the  self-amplifying nature of this derailed interaction.', ""Prostate cancer (PC) is the most common cancer in men and a leading cause of  cancer death. Prostatic gland accumulates reasonably high amount of selenium  (Se), the element that prevents the development of PC. It is hypothesized that  some selenoproteins inhibit the transformation of normal prostate epithelium  into neoplasm. We studied Se levels in whole blood, plasma and prostate of 32 PC  and 40 benign prostate hyperplasia (BPH) patients and in the control group  composed of 39 healthy subjects. The selenoenzyme glutathione peroxidase  (GSH-Px) was also measured in the patients' red cells, plasma and prostate  tissue. Se concentration in whole blood and plasma in both groups of patients  was lower as compared with controls, while in prostate gland it was  significantly higher in PC than in BPH patients and controls. Red cell GSH-Px  activity was the same in PC patients and controls but significantly lower in BPH  patients. Plasma GSH-Px activity was significantly lower in PC patients than in  the control group, and prostate GSH-Px activity was significantly lower in PC  patients as compared with BPH patients. Since Se has anticancer properties, it  is very likely that its low level in blood may facilitate the development of  cancer. A higher level of Se in prostate of PC patients has no influence on  GSH-Px activity in the gland.""]]]","Yes, selenium deficiency is involved in the development of autoimmune thyroid disease (AITD).

Is ospemifene effective for treatment of dyspareunia?,"[[[""OBJECTIVE: To update and expand the previous position statement of The North  American Menopause Society (NAMS) on the management of symptomatic vulvovaginal  atrophy (VVA) in postmenopausal women. METHODS: NAMS searched PubMed for medical literature on VVA published since  their 2007 position statement on the role of local vaginal estrogen for  treatment of vaginal atrophy in postmenopausal women. A panel of acknowledged  experts in the field of genitourinary health reviewed the literature to evaluate  new evidence on local estrogen as well as on other management options available  or in development for symptomatic VVA. The panel's conclusions and  recommendations were reviewed and approved by the NAMS Board of Trustees. RESULTS: Symptomatic VVA can significantly impair the quality of life (QOL) of  postmenopausal women and may be underdiagnosed. In most cases, it can be managed  successfully. A number of over-the-counter and government-approved prescription  therapies available in the United States and Canada demonstrate effectiveness,  depending on the severity of VVA symptoms. These include vaginal lubricants and  moisturizers, vaginal estrogen, hormone therapy, and the selective  estrogen-receptor modulator ospemifene (indicated for dyspareunia). Long-term  studies on the endometrial safety of local estrogen and ospemifene are lacking.  Changes in the vaginal microbiome have various effects on symptoms. CONCLUSIONS: Clinicians can improve the sexual health and QOL of postmenopausal  women by educating women about, diagnosing, and appropriately managing  symptomatic VVA. Choice of therapy depends on the severity of symptoms, the  effectiveness and safety of therapy for the individual patient, and patient  preference. Estrogen therapy is the most effective treatment for moderate to  severe symptoms, although a direct comparison of estrogen and ospemifene is not  available. Nonhormonal therapies available without a prescription provide  sufficient relief for most women with mild symptoms. When low-dose estrogen is  administered locally, a progestogen is not indicated for women without a uterus  and generally is not indicated for women with an intact uterus. However,  endometrial safety has not been studied in clinical trials beyond 1 year. There  are insufficient data to confirm the safety of local estrogen in women with  breast cancer; management of VVA should take the woman's needs and the  recommendation of her oncologist into consideration. Research on the vaginal  microbiome may lead to other therapies in the future."", 'INTRODUCTION: Selective estrogen receptor modulators (SERMs) have been used  off-label in men for more than 50 years. SERMs exert their action on the  estrogen receptor agonistically or antagonistically. A fundamental knowledge of  the complex molecular action and physiology of SERMs is important in  understanding their use and future directions of study in men. AIM: To review the basic science and mechanism of the action of estrogens, the  estrogen receptor, and SERMs, and the existing clinical publications on the use  of SERMs in men for infertility and hypogonadism with their strengths and  weaknesses and to identify the need for future studies. METHODS: After a review of publications on the basic science of estrogen  receptors, a chronologic review of published evidence-based studies on the use  of SERMs in men for infertility and hypogonadism was undertaken. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Clinical publications were assessed for type of study,  inclusion criteria, outcome measurements, and results. Strengths and weaknesses  of the publications were assessed and discussed. RESULTS: Few prospective rigorously controlled trials have been undertaken on  the use of SERMs in men. Most existing trials are largely retrospective  anecdotal studies with inconsistent inclusion and end-point measurements. The  SERMs are complex and at times can produce paradoxical results. Their action  likely depends on the genetics of the individual, his tissue-specific  composition of estrogen receptors, the molecular structure and pharmacodynamics  of the SERMs, and their metabolism. CONCLUSION: Rigorously controlled trials of the use of SERMs in men are needed  to better identify their clinical benefit and long-term safety in infertile and  hypogonadal men. Recent placebo-controlled pharmaceutical industry SERM trials  have demonstrated short-term safety and efficacy in men with secondary  hypogonadism and eventually might provide an alternative to exogenous  testosterone replacement therapy in men with secondary hypogonadism.

Sex Med Rev 2017;5:365-386.', 'OBJECTIVE: To investigate the noninferiority of relugolix compared with  leuprorelin acetate in reducing heavy menstrual bleeding associated with uterine  leiomyomas. METHODS: In a double-blind, double-dummy trial, premenopausal women with uterine  leiomyomas and heavy menstrual bleeding defined as a pictorial blood loss  assessment chart score of at least 120 were randomized in a 1:1 ratio to  relugolix (40 mg, oral, once daily) or leuprorelin acetate (1.88 mg or 3.75 mg,  monthly injection) for 24 weeks. The primary endpoint was the proportion of  patients with a total pictorial blood loss assessment chart score of less than  10 for weeks 6-12. Secondary endpoints included myoma and uterine volumes, and  hemoglobin levels. A sample size of 144 patients per group (n=288) was estimated  to provide at least 90% power to demonstrate noninferiority (prespecified  noninferiority margin -15%; one-sided 0.025 level of significance). RESULTS: From March 2016 to September 2017, 281 patients were randomized  (relugolix, n=139, leuprorelin n=142). Demographic and baseline characteristics  were well balanced; mean pictorial blood loss assessment chart score was 254.3  in the relugolix group and 263.7 in the leuprorelin group. The proportion of  patients with total pictorial blood loss assessment chart score of less than 10  for weeks 6-12 was 82.2% in the relugolix group and 83.1% in the leuprorelin  group, demonstrating noninferiority of relugolix compared with leuprorelin  (relugolix-leuprorelin difference -0.9%; 95% CI: -10.10 to 8.35; prespecified  noninferiority margin -15%; P=.001). Reductions in myoma and uterine volumes and  increases in hemoglobin levels were comparable in the two groups. Relugolix was  associated with an earlier effect on menstrual bleeding than leuprorelin  (pictorial blood loss assessment chart score of less than 10, 64.2% vs 31.7%  [relugolix-leuprorelin difference 32.5%; 95% CI: 20.95-44.13%] for weeks 2-6 and  pictorial blood loss assessment chart score of 0, 52.6% vs 21.8% [30.7%; 95% CI:  19.45-42.00%] for weeks 2-6) and faster recovery of menses after treatment  discontinuation (relugolix median [Q1, Q3], 37 days [32.0, 46.0]; leuprorelin  median, 65 days [54.0, 77.0]). Adverse events and bone mineral density loss were  similar between relugolix and leuprorelin treatment groups. CONCLUSION: In women with uterine leiomyomas, once-daily treatment with  relugolix, an oral gonadotropin-releasing hormone antagonist, demonstrated  noninferiority to monthly leuprorelin for improvement of heavy menstrual  bleeding at 6-12 weeks of treatment, had a more rapid effect on menstrual  bleeding, and was generally well tolerated.

FUNDING SOURCE: Takeda Pharmaceutical Company Limited and an affiliate of  NovaQuest Capital Management LLC.', 'OBJECTIVES: Women-initiated HIV-prevention products are urgently needed. To  address this need, a trial was conducted to assess the safety and  pharmacokinetics of a silicone elastomer matrix vaginal ring containing 25 mg of  the antiretroviral drug dapivirine when used continuously for 28 consecutive  days. METHODS: A double-blind, randomized, placebo-controlled trial was conducted in  16 healthy, HIV-negative women, 18-40 years of age, who were randomized 1:1 to  use either the active or matching placebo ring for 28 days. Participants were  followed during and for 28 days after ring use for safety and pharmacokinetic  evaluations. RESULTS: The dapivirine vaginal ring was safe and well tolerated with no  differences in safety endpoints between the active and placebo ring. The  concentration-time plots of dapivirine in vaginal fluid were indicative of a  sustained release of dapivirine over the 28 days of use. Dapivirine vaginal  fluid concentrations were highest near the ring, followed by the cervix and  introïtus (mean Cmax of 80, 67 and 31 μg/g, respectively). Vaginal fluid  concentrations of dapivirine on the day of ring removal (day 28) at all three  collection sites exceeded by more than 3900-fold the IC99 for dapivirine in a  tissue explant infection model. Plasma dapivirine concentrations were low (< 1  ng/ml) and remained well below those observed at the maximum tolerated dose for  oral treatment (mean Cmax of 2286 \u200ang/ml). CONCLUSION: The dapivirine vaginal ring has a safety and pharmacokinetic profile  that supports its use as a sustained-release topical microbicide for HIV-1  prevention in women.', 'Ospemifene is a selective estrogen receptor modulator (SERM), or estrogen  receptor agonist/antagonist, that was recently approved by the US Food and Drug  Administration for the treatment of dyspareunia associated with vulvar and  vaginal atrophy, a chronic condition that affects up to 60% of postmenopausal  women. Ospemifene is the first and only nonestrogen compound approved for this  indication. Compared with other approved SERMs, such as tamoxifen, toremifene,  bazedoxifene, and raloxifene, the estrogen-like effects of ospemifene in the  vaginal epithelium are unique. This review first discusses the rationale for  developing ospemifene, including its mechanism of action, and then focuses on  the clinical development of ospemifene for the treatment of dyspareunia  associated with vulvar and vaginal atrophy. Included are discussions of the  effects of ospemifene on the endometrium, serum lipids, coagulation markers,  bone, and breast cancer. In conclusion, ospemifene is a SERM with a unique  estrogen agonist/antagonist tissue profile that was recently approved in the US  for the treatment of dyspareunia associated with vulvar and vaginal atrophy in  postmenopausal women. Ospemifene warrants further clinical investigation for the  treatment and prevention of osteoporosis and breast cancer.', 'OBJECTIVE: Vaginal estrogen therapy at the lowest effective dose is generally  recommended for the treatment of vulvar and vaginal atrophy (VVA), but not all  women are candidates. Selective estrogen receptor modulators (SERMs) aim to  elicit specific positive effects on targeted tissues with neutral or minimal  negative effects on other tissues. This review compares the vaginal effects of  currently available and investigational SERMs. METHODS: Relevant English-language articles published between 1980 and 2012 were  identified through the PubMed database (search string ""[Selective Estrogen  Receptor Modulator OR SERM] AND [Vulvar OR Vaginal] AND Atrophy""), article  reference lists, and EMBASE searches for individual SERMs. Both authors reviewed  all articles, which formed the basis of this narrative literature review. RESULTS: Activity profiles of SERMs in various tissues are distinct. Tamoxifen  and arzoxifene have no specific positive vaginal effects but have reported  variable or adverse gynecologic effects. Raloxifene does not improve VVA but can  be used safely in combination with vaginal estrogen. Bazedoxifene has no  demonstrated efficacy for VVA but, in combination with oral conjugated equine  estrogens, improves the signs and symptoms of VVA. SERMs with positive vaginal  effects (such as improvement in the vaginal maturation index, reduced vaginal  pH, and improvement in the signs and symptoms of VVA) on postmenopausal  symptomatic women include lasofoxifene (clinical development on hold) and  ospemifene, which was recently approved for the treatment of VVA-related  dyspareunia, with a class effect warning of potential venous thrombosis risk. CONCLUSIONS: SERMs that specifically target the pathophysiology underlying VVA  may provide an alternative to vaginal or systemic estrogen therapy.', ""Selective estrogen receptor modulators (SERMs) are structurally different  compounds that interact with intracellular estrogen receptors in target organs  as estrogen receptor agonists or antagonists. These drugs have been intensively  studied over the past decade and have proven to be a highly versatile group for  the treatment of different conditions associated with postmenopausal women's  health, including hormone responsive cancer and osteoporosis. Tamoxifen, a  failed contraceptive is currently used to treat all stages of breast cancer,  chemoprevention in women at high risk for breast cancer and also has beneficial  effects on bone mineral density and serum lipids in postmenopausal women.  Raloxifene, a failed breast cancer drug, is the only SERM approved  internationally for the prevention and treatment of postmenopausal osteoporosis  and vertebral fractures. However, although these SERMs have many benefits, they  also have some potentially serious adverse effects, such as thromboembolic  disorders and, in the case of tamoxifen, uterine cancer. These adverse effects  represent a major concern given that long-term therapy is required to prevent  osteoporosis or prevent and treat breast cancer. The search for the 'ideal'  SERM, which would have estrogenic effects on bone and serum lipids, neutral  effects on the uterus, and antiestrogenic effects on breast tissue, but none of  the adverse effects associated with current therapies, is currently under way.  Ospemifene, lasofoxifene, bazedoxifene and arzoxifene, which are new SERM  molecules with potentially greater efficacy and potency than previous SERMs,  have been investigated for use in the treatment and prevention of osteoporosis.  These drugs have been shown to be comparably effective to conventional hormone  replacement therapy in animal models, with potential indications for an improved  safety profile. Clinical efficacy data from ongoing phase III trials are  available or are awaited for each SERM so that a true understanding of the  therapeutic potential of these compounds can be obtained. In this article, we  describe the discovery and development of the group of medicines called SERMs.  The newer SERMs in late development: ospemifene, lasofoxifene, bazedoxifene, are  arzoxifene are described in detail."", 'Vulvar and vaginal atrophy (VVA) is a chronic, progressive medical condition  prevalent among postmenopausal women, which produces symptoms such as  dyspareunia, vaginal dryness, and vaginal irritation. Currently, the only  prescription options are systemic and vaginal estrogen therapies that may be  limited by concerns about long-term safety and breast cancer risk. Ospemifene is  a tissue-selective estrogen agonist/antagonist (a selective estrogen receptor  modulator) recently approved by the US Food and Drug Administration for  treatment of dyspareunia, a symptom of VVA, due to menopause. Ospemifene, the  first nonestrogen oral treatment for this indication, may provide an alternative  to treatment with estrogen. Animal models with ospemifene suggest an inhibitory  effect on growth of malignant breast tissue, but animal data cannot necessarily  be extrapolated to humans. Clinical trials, including 3 long-term studies  assessing the overall safety of ospemifene, support that ospemifene is generally  well tolerated, with beneficial effects on the vagina, neutral effects on the  breast, and minimal effects on the endometrium.', 'IMPORTANCE OF THE FIELD: Millions of women worldwide suffer from vulvovaginal  atrophy (VVA) associated with menopause, and many women report that this  adversely affects their quality of life. Ospemifene is a non-hormonal estrogen  receptor agonist/antagonist effective in the treatment of VVA. Although similar  in structure to other estrogen receptor agonists/antagonists that have  antagonistic effects on the vagina, ospemifene has an estrogen-like effect on  vaginal epithelium. This review focuses on ospemifene including its  pharmacologic properties, clinical efficacy and safety. AREAS COVERED IN THIS REVIEW: The paper provides information on the  phamacodynamic and pharmacokinetic properties of ospemifene. It also contains an  overview of its preclinical and clinical efficacy as well as its clinical  safety. WHAT THE READER WILL GAIN: From this paper, the reader will gain an appreciation  for a new non-hormonal estrogen receptor agonist/antagonist, ospemifene. TAKE HOME MESSAGE: The pharmacologic properties of ospemifene make it a logical  candidate for the treatment of women with moderate to severe symptoms of VVA  associated with menopause. Clinical trials have confirmed that daily doses are  well-tolerated and that it is effective in normalizing vaginal maturation index  and pH as well as improving the symptoms associated with VVA including  dyspareunia.', 'OBJECTIVE: To evaluate the efficacy and safety of intermittent, luteal  phase-only administration of paroxetine (10 mg and 20 mg) in the treatment of  premenstrual dysphoric disorder (PMDD). METHOD: In this multicenter trial, female outpatients (aged 18-45 years) from 4  Canadian health centers meeting DSM-IV criteria for PMDD were asked to perform  daily ratings of their premenstrual symptoms for 2 consecutive menstrual cycles.  Those displaying the symptoms of irritability and/or depressed mood in the  luteal phases but not in the follicular phases of their menstrual cycles were  randomly assigned to intermittent, luteal phase-only treatment with paroxetine  10 mg or 20 mg or placebo for 4 additional cycles. The primary efficacy endpoint  was the percent change from baseline at study endpoint on the visual analog  scale irritability score. Treatment differences were tested using analysis of  covariance ad hoc. Estimated treatment mean differences and their associated 95%  confidence intervals were also calculated. Data were collected from May 1999 to  November 2002. RESULTS: Ninety-nine patients were included in the intention-to-treat  population. When compared with placebo, patients treated with paroxetine 20 mg  attained a significant reduction in irritability (difference in median percent  change: -23.9, 95% CI = -51.3 to -6.2, p = .014; difference in mean absolute  change: -18.6, 95% CI = -32.5 to -4.6, p = .007). A statistically significant  difference was not observed when the patients treated with the lower dose of  paroxetine (10 mg) were compared with placebo. Treatment was well tolerated with  no unexpected side effects. CONCLUSIONS: Intermittent administration of paroxetine 20 mg significantly  reduced irritability symptoms in patients with PMDD. These results are  consistent with previous studies suggesting that PMDD may be treated effectively  by luteal phase-only administration of a selective serotonin reuptake inhibitor.

Which is the role of mediator in genome organization?,"[[['Chromosome conformation capture approaches have shown that interphase chromatin  is partitioned into spatially segregated Mb-sized compartments and sub-Mb-sized  topological domains. This compartmentalization is thought to facilitate the  matching of genes and regulatory elements, but its precise function and  mechanistic basis remain unknown. Cohesin controls chromosome topology to enable  DNA repair and chromosome segregation in cycling cells. In addition, cohesin  associates with active enhancers and promoters and with CTCF to form long-range  interactions important for gene regulation. Although these findings suggest an  important role for cohesin in genome organization, this role has not been  assessed on a global scale. Unexpectedly, we find that architectural  compartments are maintained in noncycling mouse thymocytes after genetic  depletion of cohesin in vivo. Cohesin was, however, required for specific  long-range interactions within compartments where cohesin-regulated genes  reside. Cohesin depletion diminished interactions between cohesin-bound sites,  whereas alternative interactions between chromatin features associated with  transcriptional activation and repression became more prominent, with  corresponding changes in gene expression. Our findings indicate that  cohesin-mediated long-range interactions facilitate discrete gene expression  states within preexisting chromosomal compartments.', ""Mediator is a multi-unit molecular complex that plays a key role in transferring  signals from transcriptional regulators to RNA polymerase II in eukaryotes. We  have combined biochemical purification of the Saccharomyces cerevisiae Mediator  from chromatin with chromatin immunoprecipitation in order to reveal Mediator  occupancy on DNA genome-wide, and to identify proteins interacting specifically  with Mediator on the chromatin template. Tandem mass spectrometry of proteins in  immunoprecipitates of mediator complexes revealed specific interactions between  Mediator and the RSC, Arp2/Arp3, CPF, CF 1A and Lsm complexes in chromatin.  These factors are primarily involved in chromatin remodeling, actin assembly,  mRNA 3'-end processing, gene looping and mRNA decay, but they have also been  shown to enter the nucleus and participate in Pol II transcription. Moreover, we  have found that Mediator, in addition to binding Pol II promoters, occupies  chromosomal interacting domain (CID) boundaries and that Mediator in chromatin  associates with proteins that have been shown to interact with CID boundaries,  such as Sth1, Ssu72 and histone H4. This suggests that Mediator plays a  significant role in higher-order genome organization."", 'Cohesin-mediated sister chromatid cohesion is essential for chromosome  segregation and post-replicative DNA repair. In addition, evidence from model  organisms and from human genetics suggests that cohesin is involved in the  control of gene expression. This non-canonical role has recently been  rationalized by the findings that mammalian cohesin complexes are recruited to a  subset of DNase I hypersensitive sites and to conserved noncoding sequences by  the DNA-binding protein CTCF. CTCF functions at insulators (which control  interactions between enhancers and promoters) and at boundary elements (which  demarcate regions of distinct chromatin structure), and cohesin contributes to  its enhancer-blocking activity. The underlying mechanisms remain unknown, and  the full spectrum of cohesin functions remains to be determined. Here we show  that cohesin forms the topological and mechanistic basis for cell-type-specific  long-range chromosomal interactions in cis at the developmentally regulated  cytokine locus IFNG. Hence, the ability of cohesin to constrain chromosome  topology is used not only for the purpose of sister chromatid cohesion, but also  to dynamically define the spatial conformation of specific loci. This new aspect  of cohesin function is probably important for normal development and disease.', 'The role of the zinc finger protein CTCF in organizing the genome within the  nucleus is now well established. Widely separated sites on DNA, occupied by both  CTCF and the cohesin complex, make physical contacts that create large loop  domains. Additional contacts between loci within those domains, often also  mediated by CTCF, tend to be favored over contacts between loci in different  domains. A large number of studies during the past 2 years have addressed the  questions: How are these loops generated? What are the effects of disrupting  them? Are there rules governing large-scale genome organization? It now appears  that the strongest and evolutionarily most conserved of these CTCF interactions  have specific rules for the orientation of the paired CTCF sites, implying the  existence of a nonequilibrium mechanism of generation. Recent experiments that  invert, delete, or inactivate one of a mating CTCF pair result in major changes  in patterns of organization and gene expression in the surrounding regions. What  remain to be determined are the detailed molecular mechanisms for  re-establishing loop domains and maintaining them after replication and mitosis.  As recently published data show, some mechanisms may involve interactions with  noncoding RNAs as well as protein cofactors. Many CTCF sites are also involved  in other functions such as modulation of RNA splicing and specific regulation of  gene expression, and the relationship between these activities and loop  formation is another unanswered question that should keep investigators occupied  for some time.', 'Mediator is a highly conserved transcriptional coactivator organized into four  modules, namely Tail, Middle, Head, and Kinase (CKM). Previous work suggests  regulatory roles for Tail and CKM, but an integrated model for these activities  is lacking. Here, we analyzed the genome-wide distribution of Mediator subunits  in wild-type and mutant yeast cells in which RNA polymerase II promoter escape  is blocked, allowing detection of transient Mediator forms. We found that  although all modules are recruited to upstream activated regions (UAS), assembly  of Mediator within the pre-initiation complex is accompanied by the release of  CKM. Interestingly, our data show that CKM regulates Mediator-UAS interaction  rather than Mediator-promoter association. In addition, although Tail is  required for Mediator recruitment to UAS, Tailless Mediator nevertheless  interacts with core promoters. Collectively, our data suggest that the essential  function of Mediator is mediated by Head and Middle at core promoters, while  Tail and CKM play regulatory roles.', 'Homologous recombination is crucial for genome stability and for genetic  exchange. Although our knowledge of the principle steps in recombination and its  machinery is well advanced, homology search, the critical step of exploring the  genome for homologous sequences to enable recombination, has remained mostly  enigmatic. However, recent methodological advances have provided considerable  new insights into this fundamental step in recombination that can be integrated  into a mechanistic model. These advances emphasize the importance of genomic  proximity and nuclear organization for homology search and the critical role of  homology search mediators in this process. They also aid our understanding of  how homology search might lead to unwanted and potentially disease-promoting  recombination events.', 'Alterations in the regulation of gene expression are frequently associated with  developmental diseases or cancer. Transcription activation is a key phenomenon  in the regulation of gene expression. In all eukaryotes, mediator of RNA  polymerase II transcription (Mediator), a large complex with modular  organization, is generally required for transcription by RNA polymerase II, and  it regulates various steps of this process. The main function of Mediator is to  transduce signals from the transcription activators bound to enhancer regions to  the transcription machinery, which is assembled at promoters as the  preinitiation complex (PIC) to control transcription initiation. Recent  functional studies of Mediator with the use of structural biology approaches and  functional genomics have revealed new insights into Mediator activity and its  regulation during transcription initiation, including how Mediator is recruited  to transcription regulatory regions and how it interacts and cooperates with PIC  components to assist in PIC assembly. Novel roles of Mediator in the control of  gene expression have also been revealed by showing its connection to the nuclear  pore and linking Mediator to the regulation of gene positioning in the nuclear  space. Clear links between Mediator subunits and disease have also encouraged  studies to explore targeting of this complex as a potential therapeutic approach  in cancer and fungal infections.', ""Mediator is a large multiprotein complex conserved in all eukaryotes, which has  a crucial coregulator function in transcription by RNA polymerase II (Pol II).  However, the molecular mechanisms of its action in vivo remain to be understood.  Med17 is an essential and central component of the Mediator head module. In this  work, we utilised our large collection of conditional temperature-sensitive  med17 mutants to investigate Mediator's role in coordinating preinitiation  complex (PIC) formation in vivo at the genome level after a transfer to a  non-permissive temperature for 45 minutes. The effect of a yeast mutation  proposed to be equivalent to the human Med17-L371P responsible for infantile  cerebral atrophy was also analyzed. The ChIP-seq results demonstrate that med17  mutations differentially affected the global presence of several PIC components  including Mediator, TBP, TFIIH modules and Pol II. Our data show that Mediator  stabilizes TFIIK kinase and TFIIH core modules independently, suggesting that  the recruitment or the stability of TFIIH modules is regulated independently on  yeast genome. We demonstrate that Mediator selectively contributes to TBP  recruitment or stabilization to chromatin. This study provides an extensive  genome-wide view of Mediator's role in PIC formation, suggesting that Mediator  coordinates multiple steps of a PIC assembly pathway."", 'When placed between an enhancer and promoter, certain DNA sequence elements  inhibit enhancer-stimulated gene expression. The best characterized of these  enhancer-blocking insulators, gypsy in Drosophila and the CTCF-binding element  in vertebrates and flies, stabilize contacts between distant genomic regulatory  sites leading to the formation of loop domains. Current results show that CTCF  mediates long-range contacts in the mouse beta-globin locus and at the  Igf2/H19-imprinted locus. Recently described active chromatin hubs and  transcription factories also involve long-range interactions; it is likely that  CTCF interferes with their formation when acting as an insulator. The properties  of CTCF, and its newly described genomic distribution, suggest that it may play  an important role in large-scale nuclear architecture, perhaps mediated by the  co-factors with which it interacts in vivo.', 'Assembly of compact mitotic chromosomes and resolution of sister chromatids are  two essential processes for the correct segregation of the genome during  mitosis. Condensin, a five-subunit protein complex, is thought to be required  for chromosome condensation. However, recent genetic analysis suggests that  condensin is only essential to resolve sister chromatids. To study further the  function of condensin we have depleted DmSMC4, a subunit of the complex, from  Drosophila S2 cells by dsRNA-mediated interference. Cells lacking DmSMC4  assemble short mitotic chromosomes with unresolved sister chromatids where  Barren, a non-SMC subunit of the complex is unable to localise. Topoisomerase  II, however, binds mitotic chromatin after depletion of DmSMC4 but it is no  longer confined to a central axial structure and becomes diffusely distributed  all over the chromatin. Furthermore, cell extracts from DmSMC4 dsRNA-treated  cells show significantly reduced topoisomerase II-dependent DNA decatenation  activity in vitro. Nevertheless, DmSMC4-depleted chromosomes have centromeres  and kinetochores that are able to segregate, although sister chromatid arms form  extensive chromatin bridges during anaphase. These chromatin bridges do not  result from inappropriate maintenance of sister chromatid cohesion by DRAD21, a  subunit of the cohesin complex. Moreover, depletion of DmSMC4 prevents premature  sister chromatid separation, caused by removal of DRAD21, allowing cells to exit  mitosis with chromatin bridges. Our results suggest that condensin is required  so that an axial chromatid structure can be organised where topoisomerase II can  effectively promote sister chromatid resolution.']]]","Mediator plays a role in facilitating long-range interactions within architectural compartments of the genome. It helps in maintaining specific gene expression states within these compartments by forming interactions between cohesin-regulated genes. Mediator also associates with proteins that interact with chromosomal interacting domains (CIDs) and is found at DNase I hypersensitive sites and conserved noncoding sequences, suggesting it contributes to higher-order genome organization.","[{'Exact': array([ 1.12546089e+02,  7.03840503e+01,  2.63839067e+01,  1.60429610e+00,

What is the mechanisms of action of Evinacumab?,"[[[""Modification of proteins with Met1-linked 'linear' ubiquitin chains has emerged  as a key regulatory signal to control inflammatory signalling via the master  regulator, the transcription factor nuclear factor κB (NF-κB). While the  assembly machinery, the linear ubiquitin chain assembly complex (LUBAC), and  receptors for this ubiquitin chain type have been known for years, it was less  clear which deubiquitinating enzymes (DUBs) hydrolyse Met1 linkages  specifically. In 2013, two labs reported the previously unannotated protein  FAM105B/OTULIN to be this missing Met1 linkage-specific DUB. Structural studies  have revealed how OTULIN achieves its remarkable specificity, employing a  mechanism of ubiquitin-assisted catalysis in which a glutamate residue on the  substrate complements the active site of the enzyme. The specificity of OTULIN  enables it to regulate global levels of Met1-linked polyubiquitin in cells. This  ability led to investigations of NF-κB activation from new angles, and also  revealed involvement of Met1-polyubiquitin in Wnt signalling. Interestingly,  OTULIN directly interacts with LUBAC, and this interaction is dynamic and can be  regulated by OTULIN phosphorylation. This provides a new paradigm for how  individual linkage types can be regulated by dedicated enzyme complexes  mediating assembly and removal. Here we review what has been learned about  OTULIN's mechanism, regulation and function, discuss the open questions in the  field, and discuss how DUBs regulate the NF-κB response."", ""The pathogenic mechanisms underlying cancer development are complex and  heterogeneous, involving multiple cellular signaling transduction pathways that  usually function redundantly. In addition, crosstalk between these pathways  generates a complicated and robust signaling network that is regulated by  compensatory mechanisms. Given the complexity of cancer pathogenesis and  progression, many of the currently used antitumor agents, which typically target  a single intracellular pathway, might not always be effective on complex tumor  systems. Moreover, long-term use of these agents often generates drug resistance  and toxicity against normal cells. Therefore, the development of novel  anticancer chemotherapies is urgently needed.Scutellaria barbataD Don (SB) is a  medicinal herb that has long been used in China to treat various types of  cancer. We previously reported that the ethanol extract of SB (EESB) is able to  induce colon cancer cell apoptosis, inhibit cell proliferation and tumor  angiogenesis via modulation of several pathways, including Hedgehog, Akt, and  p53. To further elucidate the precise mechanisms of SB's antitumor activity,  using a colorectal cancer (CRC) mouse xenograft model in the present study, we  evaluated the therapeutic efficacy and molecular mechanisms of EESB against  tumor growth. We found that EESB reduced tumor volume and tumor weight but had  no effect on body weight gain in CRC mice, demonstrating that EESB could inhibit  colon cancer growth in vivo without apparent adverse effect. In addition, EESB  treatment could significantly suppress the activation of several CRC-related  pathways, including STAT3, Erk, and p38 signalings in tumor tissues, and alter  the expression of multiple critical target genes such as Bcl-2, Bax, Cyclin D1,  CDK4, and p21. These molecular effects lead to the induction of cancer cell  apoptosis and inhibition of cell proliferation. Our findings demonstrate that SB  possesses a broad range of antitumor activities because of its ability to affect  multiple intracellular targets."", 'OBJECTIVE: Homozygous familial hypercholesterolemia is a rare disease usually  caused by LDLR (low-density lipoprotein receptor) mutations. Homozygous familial  hypercholesterolemia is characterized by markedly elevated LDL-C (low-density  lipoprotein cholesterol) levels and an extremely high risk of premature  atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease. A phase 2, proof-of-concept study  (NCT02265952) demonstrated that evinacumab, a fully human monoclonal antibody to  ANGPTL3 (angiopoietin-like 3 protein), reduced LDL-C levels in 9 patients with  genotypically confirmed homozygous familial hypercholesterolemia and was well  tolerated. The aim of this study was to analyze the effects of evinacumab on  LDLR activity in lymphocytes purified from patients in the proof-of-concept  study. Approach and Results: LDLR activity was assessed in patient lymphocytes  before and after treatment with evinacumab and versus lymphocytes carrying  wild-type LDLR, and also in an LDLR-defective Chinese hamster ovary cell line  (CHO-ldlA7) transfected with plasmids encoding the LDLR variants. Overall mean  peak reduction in LDL-C with evinacumab was -58±18%, occurring between Week 4  and Week 12. Mutations identified in the 9 patients were shown to be pathogenic,  with loss of LDLR activity versus wild type. Two of the LDLR variants,  p.(Cys681*) and p.(Ala627Profs*38), were class 2 type mutations that are  retained in the endoplasmic reticulum. Six variants were class 3 type mutations  with impaired LDL-C binding activity: p.(Trp87Gly), occurring in 2 patients,  p.(Gln254Pro), p.(Ser177Leu), p.(Gly335Val), and p.(Ser306Leu). Evinacumab had  no effect on LDLR activity. CONCLUSIONS: These results suggest that evinacumab is effective for lowering  LDL-C in patients with homozygous familial hypercholesterolemia, and the  inhibition of ANGPTL3 in humans lowers LDL-C in a mechanism independent of the  LDLR.', 'Mannose 6-phosphate receptors carry newly synthesized lysosomal hydrolases from  the trans-Golgi network to endosomes, then return to the trans-Golgi network for  another round of enzyme delivery. Wortmannin, an inhibitor of  phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase, interferes with the delivery of newly synthesized  lysosomal enzymes to lysosomes. We used two independent assays of mannose  6-phosphate receptor trafficking to determine the precise step that is blocked  by wortmannin. Using an assay that monitors resialylation of desialylated cell  surface 300-kDa mannose 6-phosphate receptors, we found that receptor  endocytosis and transport to the trans-Golgi network were not inhibited by 2  microM wortmannin. In addition, this concentration of drug had no effect on the  transport of the mannose 6-phosphate receptor from late endosomes to the  trans-Golgi network using a system that reconstitutes this transport process in  cell extracts. Under the same conditions, wortmannin significantly inhibited the  generation of mature cathepsin D. In addition, the structurally unrelated  phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase inhibitor, LY294002, was also without effect when  added to in vitro endosome-trans-Golgi network transport reactions. These  experiments demonstrate that the interruption in lysosomal enzyme targeting is  most likely due to a wortmannin-sensitive process required for the export of  these receptors from the trans-Golgi network, consistent with the established  role of phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase in the equivalent transport process in  Saccharomyces cerevisiae.', 'OBJECTIVE: Engulfment and cell motility 1 (Elmo1) has been reported to cooperate  with dedicator of cytokinesis 1 (Dock180) and to be linked to the invasive  phenotype of cancer cells through activating small G-protein Rac. We aimed to  study the role of Elmo1 in the malignant migration of ovarian cancer. METHODS: Engulfment and cell motility 1 expression was evaluated in specimens  from 93 patients with serous ovarian cancer (SOC) by immunohistochemical  staining. Next, Elmo1-RNAi cells were established by validated small  interference RNAs. Cell proliferation and cell motility were observed and  compared with Dock180-RNAi cells. To confirm their synergetic contribution to  forming focal adhesion and activating Rac1, Rac1-GTP level was measured by GST  pull-down assay and immunofluorescence was used to observe focal adhesion  formation both in Elmo1-RNAi and Dock180-RNAi cells. RESULTS: Engulfment and cell motility 1 was mainly overexpressed in high-grade  SOC tissues. Western blot analysis demonstrated that both Elmo1 and Dock180  expressions were hampered in Elmo1-RNAi cells. Compared with the negative  control, decreased colony formation and cell invasion were observed in  Elmo1-RNAi cells and Dock180-RNAi cells. Consistently, both exhibited reduced  Rac1-GTP level and inhibited focal adhesion formation. CONCLUSIONS: Engulfment and cell motility 1 presents with synergetic action in  helping Dock180 to activate Rac1 and promote cell motility, and thus promote  untoward expansion and aggressiveness of SOC.', 'Lipid-lowering therapy is one major cornerstone of medical treatment of  cardiovascular disease in order to modulate atherosclerosis. Statins, ezetimibe  and novel PCSK9-inhibitors are already recommended in current guidelines and  were shown to improve lipid profiles and have positive effects on the rate of  ischemic events and cardiovascular mortality. Recent studies suggest that the  concept of ""The lower the better"" might be valid at least regarding low density  lipoproteins. In addition, lowering lipoprotein (a) still displays a major  challenge in lipid therapy. Furthermore, also lowering triglycerides seems to  improve cardiovascular outcome. Regarding triglycerides, icosapent ethyl, a  polyunsaturated fatty acid recently attracted attention showing cardiovascular  risk reduction due to triglyceride lowering. Therefore, new therapeutic  strategies and drug classes are eagerly awaited. Targeting LDL, bempedoic acid  and the siRNA inclisiran provide promising results. Moreover, regarding TG a  monoclonal antibody called evinacumab and an antisense-oligonucleotide against  ANGPTL3 showed effective TG-lowering. At least, using antisense-oligonucleotides  against ApoC-III and Lp(a) resulted in promising outcomes. In this review,  current and future options for lipid management are presented depending on  different drug classes.', 'BACKGROUND: Hypertriglyceridemia is associated with increased cardiovascular  risk and may be caused by impaired lipoprotein clearance. Angiopoietin-like  protein 3 (ANGPTL3) inhibits lipoprotein lipase activity, increasing  triglycerides and other lipids. Evinacumab, an ANGPTL3 inhibitor, reduced  triglycerides in healthy human volunteers and in homozygous familial  hypercholesterolemic individuals. Results from 2 Phase 1 studies in  hypertriglyceridemic subjects are reported here. METHODS: Subjects with triglycerides >150 but ≤450 mg/dL and low-density  lipoprotein cholesterol ≥100 mg/dL (n=83 for single ascending dose study [SAD];  n=56 for multiple ascending dose study [MAD]) were randomized 3:1 to  evinacumab:placebo. SAD subjects received evinacumab subcutaneously at  75/150/250 mg, or intravenously at 5/10/20 mg/kg, monitored up to day 126. MAD  subjects received evinacumab subcutaneously at 150/300/450 mg once weekly,  300/450 mg every 2 weeks, or intravenously at 20 mg/kg once every 4 weeks up to  day 56 with 6 months of follow-up. The primary outcomes were incidence and  severity of treatment-emergent adverse events. Efficacy analyses included  changes in triglycerides and other lipids over time. RESULTS: In the SAD, 32 (51.6%) versus 9 (42.9%) subjects on evinacumab versus  placebo reported treatment-emergent adverse events. In the MAD, 21 (67.7%)  versus 9 (75.0%) subjects on subcutaneously evinacumab versus placebo and 6  (85.7%) versus 1 (50.0%) on intravenously evinacumab versus placebo reported  treatment-emergent adverse events. No serious treatment-emergent adverse events  or events leading to death or treatment discontinuation were reported.  Elevations in alanine aminotransferase (7 [11.3%] SAD), aspartate  aminotransferase (4 [6.5%] SAD), and creatinine phosphokinase (2 [3.2%) SAD, 1  [14.3%] MAD) were observed with evinacumab (none in the placebo groups), which  were single elevations and were not dose-related. Dose-dependent reductions in  triglycerides were observed in both studies, with maximum reduction of 76.9% at  day 3 with 10 mg/kg intravenously (P<0.0001) in the SAD and of 83.1% at day 2  with 20 mg/kg intravenously once every 4 weeks (P=0.0003) in the MAD.  Significant reductions in other lipids were observed with most evinacumab doses  versus placebo. CONCLUSION: Evinacumab was well-tolerated in 2 Phase 1 studies. Lipid changes in  hypertriglyceridemic subjects were similar to those observed with ANGPTL3  loss-of-function mutations. Because the latter is associated with reduced  cardiovascular risk, ANGPTL3 inhibition may improve clinical outcomes. CLINICAL TRIAL REGISTRATION: https://www.clinicaltrials.gov. Unique identifiers:  NCT01749878 and NCT02107872.', 'Artepillin C is the main compound present in propolis from Baccharis  dracunculifolia, whose antitumor activity has been the focus of many studies.  Herein, we shall investigate the Artepillin C mechanisms of action against cells  derived from the oropharyngeal carcinoma (HEp-2). Cytotoxicity tests revealed  that the concentrations of Artepillin C required to reduce cell viability by 50%  (CC50) are dependent on the incubation time, decreasing from 40.7\xa0×\xa010-5\xa0mol/L  to 15.7\xa0×\xa010-5\xa0mol/L and 9.05\xa0×\xa010-5\xa0mol/L considering 12, 24 and 48\xa0h,  respectively. Hydrophobic interactions on neutral species of Artepillin C induce  aggregation over the HEp-2 plasma membrane, given the acid conditions of the  cellular culture. Indeed, Langmuir monolayers mimicking cellular membranes of  tumor cells revealed Artepillin C affinity to interact with  1,2-dipalmitoyl-sn-glycero-3-phosphocholine (DPPC) containing 20\xa0mol% of  1,2-dipalmitoyl-sn-glychero-3-phosphoserine (DPPS), leading aggregation on giant  unilamellar vesicles (GUVs) at pH\xa03.2. Moreover, leakage experiments on GUVs  have shown that the presence of DPPS enhances the efflux of the fluorescent  probe signaling the membrane permeabilization, which is the origin of the  necrotic pathway triggered in HEp-2 cells, as observed by flow cytometry assays.', 'Although elevated serum low-density lipoprotein-cholesterol (LDL-C) is without  any doubts accepted as an important risk factor for cardiovascular disease  (CVD), the role of elevated triglycerides (TGs)-rich lipoproteins as an  independent risk factor has until recently been quite controversial. Recent data  strongly suggest that elevated TG-rich lipoproteins are an independent risk  factor for CVD and that therapeutic targeting of them could possibly provide  further benefit in reducing CVD morbidity, events and mortality, apart from  LDL-C lowering. Today elevated TGs are treated with lifestyle interventions, and  with fibrates which could be combined with omega-3 fatty acids. There are also  some new drugs. Volanesorsen, is an antisense oligonucleotid that inhibits the  production of the Apo C-III which is crucial in regulating TGs metabolism  because it inhibits lipoprotein lipase (LPL) and hepatic lipase activity but  also hepatic uptake of TGs-rich particles. Evinacumab is a monoclonal antibody  against angiopoietin-like protein 3 (ANGPTL3) and it seems that it can  substantially lower elevated TGs levels because ANGPTL3 also regulates TGs  metabolism. Pemafibrate is a selective peroxisome proliferator-activated  receptor alpha modulator which also decreases TGs, and improves other lipid  parameters. It seems that it also has some other possible antiatherogenic  effects. Alipogene tiparvovec is a nonreplicating adeno-associated viral vector  that delivers copies of the LPL gene to muscle tissue which accelerates the  clearance of TG-rich lipoproteins thus decreasing extremely high TGs levels.  Pradigastat is a novel diacylglycerol acyltransferase 1 inhibitor which  substantially reduces extremely high TGs levels and appears to be promising in  treatment of the rare familial chylomicronemia syndrome.', ""Angiopoietin-like 3 protein (ANGPTL3) is an inhibitor of both lipoprotein lipase  and endothelial lipase in humans. Population studies indicate a relationship  between loss of function mutations in ANGPTL3 and favorable reductions in  triglycerides and non- high-density lipoprotein cholesterol. In addition, loss  of function mutations is associated with a reduced risk of coronary artery  disease. Whereas ANGPTL3's role in human lipid metabolism has yet to be fully  clarified, it is unlikely that ANGPTL3 impacts cholesterol uptake via the  low-density lipoprotein-receptor, unlike the proprotein convertase  subtilisin/kexin9 inhibitors. In contrast to other forms of lipid-lowering  therapy, ANGPTL3 inhibition may improve insulin sensitivity. The promise of this  new therapy, particularly its independence from the low-density  lipoprotein-receptor, has prompted the creation of a monoclonal antibody  inhibitor; evinacumab. Evinacumab has shown favorable lipid-lowering action in  both human and mouse models. Efficacy trials are currently ongoing and will be  completed in the near future. In addition, ANGPTL3 inhibition via an antisense  oligonucleotide was performed in healthy human subjects, which resulted in a  dose-dependent reduction in circulating ANGPTL3 levels and an antiatherogenic  lipid profile. When tested in mouse models, administration of the antisense  oligonucleotide caused a reduction in progression of atherosclerosis. Further  investigation is required to evaluate the efficacy, safety and net benefit of  clinical ANGPTL3 inhibition before it can be accepted into clinical practice.""]]]","Evinacumab works by inhibiting angiopoietin-like protein 3 (ANGPTL3), which is an inhibitor of both lipoprotein lipase and endothelial lipase. By blocking ANGPTL3, evinacumab increases the activity of these enzymes, thereby enhancing lipoprotein lipase and endothelial lipase functions. This leads to higher breakdown of triglycerides and other lipids, resulting in lower triglyceride levels in the blood. The effectiveness of evinacumab has been demonstrated in both human and mouse models, showing favorable lipid-lowering action.","[{'Exact': array([  3.44309894,  -2.48548146,  -2.08542328,  -1.50462122,

Is long QT syndrome a cause for sudden cardiac death in athletes?,"[[['Sudden cardiac death in athletes is usually due to underlying cardiovascular  disease. In the young less than 30 years of age, the most common abnormality is  hypertrophic cardiomyopathy, followed by congenital coronary artery anomalies.  The final common pathway is usually ventricular fibrillation. Sudden cardiac  death in the young is rare but remains a source of concern. A careful screening  history and physical examination, especially for potential athletes, should  identify the majority of young people at risk.', 'In approximately 10-20% of all sudden deaths, no structural cardiac  abnormalities can be identified. Important potential causes of sudden cardiac  deaths in the absence of heart disease are primary electrical diseases such as  Brugada syndrome, long QT syndrome (LQTS), short QT syndrome (SQTS), and  catecholaminergic polymorphic ventricular tachyarrhythmias (CPVT). The resting  ECG and the ECG under exercise are pivotal for the diagnosis of ion channel  diseases. Molecular genetic screening can reveal underlying mutations in a  variable degree among the cardiac ion channel diseases in up to 70% (LQTS) and  may identify individuals with incomplete penetration of the disease. In patients  with primary electrical diseases, specific clinical triggers for arrhythmic  events such as syncope or sudden cardiac death have been identified including  exercise, strenuous activity, auditory stimuli, or increased vagal tone. Young,  otherwise healthy individuals are likely to be involved in sports activity.  Therefore, special attention has to be given to advise these patients.  Competitive sports and vigorous exercise are contraindications in almost all  patients. Even recreational exercise may have to be avoided in phenotypically  overt patients or silent gene carriers depending on the underlying disease.', 'A group of relatively uncommon but important genetic cardiovascular diseases  (GCVDs) are associated with increased risk for sudden cardiac death during  exercise, including hypertrophic cardiomyopathy, long-QT syndrome, Marfan  syndrome, and arrhythmogenic right ventricular cardiomyopathy. These conditions,  characterized by diverse phenotypic expression and genetic substrates, account  for a substantial proportion of unexpected and usually arrhythmia-based fatal  events during adolescence and young adulthood. Guidelines are in place governing  eligibility and disqualification criteria for competitive athletes with these  GCVDs (eg, Bethesda Conference No. 26 and its update as Bethesda Conference No.  36 in 2005). However, similar systematic recommendations for the much larger  population of patients with GCVD who are not trained athletes, but nevertheless  wish to participate in any of a variety of recreational physical activities and  sports, have not been available. The practicing clinician is frequently  confronted with the dilemma of designing noncompetitive exercise programs for  athletes with GCVD after disqualification from competition, as well as for those  patients with such conditions who do not aspire to organized sports. Indeed,  many asymptomatic (or mildly symptomatic) patients with GCVD desire a physically  active lifestyle with participation in recreational and leisure-time activities  to take advantage of the many documented benefits of exercise. However, to date,  no reference document has been available for ascertaining which types of  physical activity could be regarded as either prudent or inadvisable in these  subgroups of patients. Therefore, given this clear and present need, this  American Heart Association consensus document was constituted, based largely on  the experience and insights of the expert panel, to offer recommendations  governing recreational exercise for patients with known GCVDs.', 'Sudden cardiac death (SCD) in young athletes is generally caused by inherited  cardiac disorders. While these events are relatively few compared to other  cardiac deaths, they are tragic in that death occurs in a young, otherwise  healthy person. The genetic abnormalities most associated with SCD are  hypertrophic cardiomyopathy, arrhythmogenic right ventricular cardiomyopathy,  long QT syndrome, Brugada syndrome, and catecholaminergic polymorphic  ventricular tachycardia. As a result of growing awareness that these deaths can  be prevented, guidelines have been issued in both Europe and the United States  to help screen and determine qualification for young persons who want to  participate in competitive athletics. There remains debate on the how extensive  screening should be, in particular over the use of the 12-lead electrocardiogram  (ECG), with European guidelines mandating ECG and United States guidelines not  recommending routine use of the ECG.', 'Sudden cardiac deaths in athletes are usually due to underlying cardiovascular  disease. The final pathway is usually ventricular fibrillation following  hypertrophic cardiomyopathy and coronary artery anomalies in young persons below  the age of 30 years. Sudden cardiac death in young is rare but remains as a  source of concern. A postmortem study was conducted to ascertain the cardiac  causes of sudden death in persons below the age group 30 years following  exercise in games or otherwise. Out of 15 cases in autopsy finding, hypertrophic  cardiomyopathy (n=7) was the commonest cause followed by coronary artery  anomalies (n=4). Sudden unexpected death is a source of concern and careful  screening of history and physical examination for potential athletes should  identify majority of people at risk.', 'Knowledge of sudden cardiac death in young athletes is imperative for all  physicians and allied health professionals. The complete differential diagnosis  of a young patient with sudden cardiac arrest will result in proper work-up and  treatment. In this article, we review several etiologies of sudden cardiac  death, including hypertrophic cardiomyopathy, arrhythmogenic right ventricular  cardiomyopathy, Wolff-Parkinson-White syndrome, long QT syndrome, Brugada  syndrome, and commotio cordis. Clinical findings, work-up, treatment, long-term  management, and athlete preparticipation screening guidelines are discussed.', 'Cardiovascular diseases account for 40% of all deaths in the Western countries,  and nearly two thirds of them occur suddenly. Young people (<35 years) are not  spared from sudden death (SD) with a rate of 1/100,000 per year. Effort is a  trigger with a threefold risk in athletes vs. nonathletes, and sports  disqualification is by itself life-saving in people with underlying concealed  cardiovascular diseases. Several culprits of cardiac SD may be identified at  postmortem and atherosclerotic coronary artery disease is the leading cause (25%  of SD cases in the young), mostly consisting of a single obstructive plaque with  fibrocellular intimal proliferation. However, the spectrum of cardiovascular  substrates is wide and include also congenital diseases of the coronary arteries  (mainly anomalous origin), myocardium (arrhythmogenic and hypertrophic  cardiomyopathies, myocarditis), valves (aortic stenosis and mitral valve  prolapse), and conduction system (ventricular preexcitation, accelerated  atrioventricular conduction and block). In up to 20% of cases, the heart is  grossly and histologically normal at autopsy (unexplained SD or ""mors sine  materia""), and inherited ion channel diseases have been implicated (long and  short QT syndromes, Brugada syndrome, catecholaminergic polymorphic ventricular  tachycardia). Targets to treat and prevent SD in the young consist of the  following: (a) avoid triggers like effort or emotion, (b) inhibit the onset of  arrhythmias with drugs or ablation, (c) switch off arrhythmias with  defibrillator, and (d) hinder the recurrence of the disease with genetic  counseling and/or therapy. In vivo detection of cardiomyopathies is nowadays  feasible by electrocardiogram and/or echocardiography, which resulted in a sharp  decline of SD in the athletes in Italy, thanks to obligatory preparticipation  screening for sport activity. Genetic screening could play a pivotal role in  early detection of asymptomatic mutation carriers of cardiovascular diseases at  risk of SD.', 'The congenital long QT syndrome (LQTS) is caused by cardiac ion channel  mutations, which predispose young individuals to sudden cardiac death often  related to exercise. The issue of LQTS and sports participation has received  significant publicity due to reports of sudden death in young competitive  athletes. This article reviews the pathophysiology, clinical characteristics,  and management of LQTS in the physically active and athletic population.', 'Previous events evidence that sudden cardiac death (SCD) in athletes is still a  reality and it keeps challenging cardiologists. Considering the importance of  SCD in athletes and the requisite for an update of this matter, we endeavored to  describe SCD in athletes. The Medline (via PubMed) and SciELO databases were  searched using the subject keywords ""sudden death, athletes and mortality"". The  incidence of SCD is expected at one case for each 200,000 young athletes per  year. Overall it is resulted of complex dealings of factors such as  arrhythmogenic substrate, regulator and triggers factors. In great part of  deaths caused by heart disease in athletes younger than 35 years old  investigations evidence cardiac congenital abnormalities. Athletes above 35  years old possibly die due to impairments of coronary heart disease, frequently  caused by atherosclerosis. Myocardial ischemia and myocardial infarction are  responsible for the most cases of SCD above this age (80%). Pre-participatory  athletes\' evaluation helps to recognize situations that may put the athlete\'s  life in risk including cardiovascular diseases. In summary, cardiologic  examinations of athletes\' pre-competition routine is an important way to  minimize the risk of SCD.', ""Athletic activity is associated with an increased risk of sudden death for  individuals with some congenital or acquired heart disorders. This review  considers in particular the causes of death affecting athletes below 35 years of  age. In this age group the largest proportion of deaths are caused by diseases  with autosomal dominant inheritance such as hypertrophic cardiomyopathy,  arrhythmogenic right ventricular cardiomyopathy, long QT-syndrome, and Marfan's  syndrome. A policy of early cascade-screening of all first-degree relatives of  patients with these disorders will therefore detect a substantial number of  individuals at risk. A strictly regulated system with preparticipation screening  of all athletes following a protocol pioneered in Italy, including school-age  children, can also detect cases caused by sporadic new mutations and has been  shown to reduce excess mortality among athletes substantially. Recommendations  for screening procedure are reviewed. It is concluded that ECG screening ought  to be part of preparticipation screening, but using criteria that do not cause  too many false positives among athletes. One such suggested protocol will show  positive in approximately 5% of screened individuals, among whom many will be  screened for these diseases. On this point further research is needed to define  what kind of false-positive and false-negative rate these new criteria result  in. A less formal system based on cascade-screening of relatives, education of  coaches about suspicious symptoms, and preparticipation questionnaires used by  athletic clubs, has been associated over time with a sizeable reduction in  sudden cardiac deaths among Swedish athletes, and thus appears to be worth  implementing even for junior athletes not recommended for formal  preparticipation screening. It is strongly argued that in families with  autosomal dominant disorders the first screening of children should be carried  out no later than 6 to 7 years of age.""]]]","Yes, long QT syndrome is a cause for sudden cardiac death in athletes.

Which genes are affected in ROMANO-WARD syndrome?,"[[['BACKGROUND: Loss-of-function mutations in the gene KCNQ1 encoding the Kv7.1 K(+)  channel cause long QT syndrome type 1 (LQT1), whereas gain-of-function mutations  are associated with short QT syndrome as well as familial atrial fibrillation  (FAF). However, KCNQ1 mutation pleiotropy, which is capable of expressing both  LQT1 and FAF, has not been demonstrated for a discrete KCNQ1 mutation. The  genotype-phenotype relationship for a family with FAF suggests a possible  association with the LQT1 p.Arg231Cys-KCNQ1 (R231C-Q1) mutation. OBJECTIVE: The purpose of this study was to determine whether R231C-Q1 also can  be linked to FAF. METHODS: The R231C-Q1 proband with AF underwent genetic testing for possible  mutations in 10 other AF-linked genes plus KCNH2 and SCN5A. Sixteen members from  five other R231C-positive LQT1 families were genetically tested for 21 single  nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) to determine if the FAF family had  discriminatory SNPs associated with AF. R231C-Q1 was expressed with KCNE1 (E1)  in HEK293 cells, and Q1E1 currents (I(Q1E1)) were analyzed using the whole-cell  patch-clamp technique. RESULTS: Genetic analyses revealed no additional mutations or discriminatory  SNPs. Cells expressing WT-Q1 and R231C-Q1 exhibited some constitutively active  I(Q1E1) and smaller maximal I(Q1E1) compared to cells expressing WT-Q1. CONCLUSION: Constitutively active I(Q1E1) and a smaller peak I(Q1E1) are common  features of FAF-associated and LQT1-associated mutations, respectively. These  data suggest that the mixed functional properties of R231C-Q1 may predispose  some families to LQT1 or FAF. We conclude that R231C is a pleiotropic missense  mutation capable of LQT1 expression, AF expression, or both.', 'Dominantly acting, allelic mutations of the fibroblast growth factor receptor 2  (FGFR2) gene have been described in five craniosynostosis syndromes. In Apert  syndrome, characterised by syndactyly of the hands and feet, recurrent mutations  of a serine-proline dipeptide (either Ser252Trp or Pro253Arg) in the linker  between the IgII and IgIII extracellular immunoglobulin-like domains, have been  documented in more than 160 unrelated individuals. We have identified three  novel mutations of this dipeptide, associated with distinct phenotypes. A C-->T  mutation that predicts a Ser252Leu substitution, ascertained in a boy with mild  Crouzon syndrome (craniosynostosis with normal limbs) is also present in three  clinically normal members of his family. A CG-->TT mutation that predicts a  Ser252Phe substitution results in a phenotype consistent with Apert syndrome.  Finally, a CGC-->TCT mutation that predicts a double amino acid substitution  (Ser252Phe and Pro253Ser) causes a Pfeiffer syndrome variant with mild  craniosynostosis, broad thumbs and big toes, fixed extension of several digits,  and only minimal cutaneous syndactyly. The observation that the Ser252Phe  mutation causes Apert syndrome, whereas the other single or double substitutions  are associated with milder or normal phenotypes, highlights the exquisitely  specific molecular pathogenesis of the limb and craniofacial abnormalities  associated with Apert syndrome. Ser252Phe is the first noncanonical mutation to  be identified in this disorder, its rarity being explained by the requirement  for two residues of the serine codon to be mutated. The description of  independent, complex nucleotide substitutions involving identical nucleotides is  unprecedented, and we speculate that this may result from functional selection  of FGFR mutations in sperm.', ""OBJECTIVE: Candidate gene association studies and genome-wide association  studies (GWAs) have identified a large number of single nucleotide polymorphisms  (SNPs) loci affecting susceptibility to rheumatoid arthritis (RA). However, for  the same locus, some studies have yielded inconsistent results. To assess all  the available evidence for association, we performed a meta-analysis on  previously published case-control studies investigating the association between  SNPs and RA. METHODS: Two hundred and sixteen studies, involving 125 SNPs, were reviewed. For  each SNP, three genetic models were considered: the allele, dominant and  recessive effects models. For each model, the effect summary odds ratio (OR) and  95% CIs were calculated. Cochran's Q-statistics were used to assess  heterogeneity. If the heterogeneity was high, a random effects model was used  for meta-analysis, otherwise a fixed effects model was used. RESULTS: The meta-analysis results showed that: (1) 30, 28 and 26 SNPs were  significantly associated with RA (P<0.01) for the allele, dominant, and  recessive models, respectively. (2) rs2476601 (PTPN22) showed the strongest  association for all the three models: OR\u200a=\u200a1.605, 95% CI: 1.540-1.672,  P<1.00E-15 for the T-allele; OR\u200a=\u200a1.638, 95% CI: 1.565-1.714, P<1.00E-15 for the  T/T+T/C genotype and OR\u200a=\u200a2.544, 95% CI: 2.173-2.978, P<1.00E-15 for the T/T  genotype. (3) Only 23 (18.4%), 13 (10.4%) and 15 (12.0%) SNPs had high  heterogeneity (P<0.01) for the three models, respectively. (4) For some of the  SNPs, there was no publication bias according to Funnel plots and Egger's  regression tests (P<0.01). For the other SNPs, the associations were tested in  only a few studies, and may have been subject to publication bias. More studies  on these loci are required. CONCLUSION: Our meta-analysis provides a comprehensive evaluation of the RA  association studies from the past two decades.

We have performed DNA sequencing of the  LQTS-associated genes in 169 unrelated patients referred for genetic testing  with respect to Romano Ward syndrome and in 13 unrelated patients referred for  genetic testing with respect to Jervell and Lange-Nielsen syndrome. A total of  37 different mutations in the 5 genes, of which 20 were novel, were identified.  Among patients with the most stringent clinical criteria of Romano Ward  syndrome, a mutation was identified in 71%. Twelve of the 13 unrelated patients  referred for genetic testing with respect to Jervell and Lange-Nielsen syndrome  were provided with a molecular genetic diagnosis. Cascade genetic screening of  505 relatives of index patients with molecularly defined LQTS identified 251  mutation carriers. The observed penetrance was 41%. Although caution must be  exerted, the prevalence of heterozygotes for mutations in the LQTS-associated  genes in Norway could be in the range 1/100-1/300, based on the prevalence of  patients with Jervell and Lange-Nielsen syndrome.', ""We describe a Swedish family with the proband and his brother suffering from  severe Romano-Ward syndome (RWS) associated with compound heterozygosity for two  mutations in the KVLQT1 (also known as KCNQ1 and KCNA9) gene (R518X and A525T).  The mutations were found to segregate as heterozygotes in the maternal and the  paternal lineage, respectively. None of the heterozygotes exhibited clinical  long QT syndrome (LQTS). No hearing defects were found in the proband. The data  strongly indicates that the compound heterozygosity for R518X and A525T is the  cause of an autosomal recessive form of RWS in this family. Our findings support  the implication of a higher frequency of gene carriers than previously expected.  We suggest that relatives of 'sporadic RWS' patients should be considered  potential carriers, at risk of dying suddenly from drug-induced LQTS."", 'Arachnomelia syndrome (AS), mainly found in Brown Swiss and Simmental cattle, is  a congenital lethal genetic malformation of the skeletal system. In this study,  a network-based disease gene prioritization approach was implemented to rank  genes in the previously reported ∼7 Mb region on chromosome 23 associated with  AS in Simmental cattle. The top 6 ranked candidate genes were sequenced in four  German Simmental bulls, one known AS-carrier ROMEL and a pooled sample of three  known non-carriers (BOSSAG, RIFURT and HIRMER). Two suspicious mutations located  in coding regions, a mis-sense mutation c.1303G>A in the bystin-like (BYSL) gene  and a 2-bp deletion mutation c.1224_1225delCA in the molybdenum cofactor  synthesis step 1 (MOCS1) gene were detected. Bioinformatic analysis revealed  that the mutation in MOCS1 was more likely to be the causative mutation.  Screening the c.1224_1225delCA site in 383 individuals from 12 cattle  breeds/lines, we found that only the bull ROMEL and his 12 confirmed progeny  carried the mutation. Thus, our results confirm the conclusion of Buitkamp et  al. that the 2-bp deletion mutation c.1224_1225delCA in exon 11 of the MOCS1  gene is causative for AS in Simmental cattle. Furthermore, a polymerase chain  reaction-restriction fragment length polymorphism (PCR-RFLP) was developed to  detect the causative mutation.', 'Long QT syndrome type 1 (LQT1) causes torsades de pointes arrhythmia,  ventricular fibrillation, and sudden death. It usually is inherited as an  autosomal dominant trait (Romano-Ward syndrome). The primary defect in LQT1 is a  mutation in KVLQT1, a gene that encodes the pore-forming alpha-subunit of a K+  channel. KvLQT1 alpha-subunits coassemble with minK beta-subunits to form  channels that conduct the slow delayed rectifier K+ current (I(Ks)) in the  heart. Recessive mutations in KVLQT1 cause Jervell and Lange-Nielsen syndrome,  which is characterized by more severe arrhythmias and congenital neural  deafness. Heterologous expression studies demonstrated that mutations in KVLQT1  reduce I(Ks) by causing loss of channel function, altered channel gating, and/or  a dominant-negative effect. It remains to be proven that an understanding of the  molecular basis of LQT1 will lead to more effective therapy.', 'BACKGROUND: Anesthesia in patients with long QT syndrome (LQTS) is a matter of  concern. Congenital LQTS is most frequently caused by mutations in KCNQ1  (Kv7.1), whereas drug-induced LQTS is a consequence of HERG (human  ether-a-go-go-related gene) channel inhibition. The aim of this study was to  investigate whether the LQT1 mutation A344V in the S6 region of KCNQ1, at a  position corresponding to the local anesthetic binding site in HERG, may render  drug insensitive KCNQ1 channels into a toxicologically relevant target of these  pharmacologic agents. This may suggest that LQTS constitutes not only a  nonspecific but also a specific pharmacogenetic risk factor for anesthesia. METHODS: The authors examined electrophysiologic and pharmacologic properties of  wild-type and mutant KCNQ1 channels. The effects of bupivacaine, ropivacaine,  and mepivacaine were investigated using two-electrode voltage clamp and whole  cell patch clamp recordings. RESULTS: The mutation A344V induced voltage-dependent inactivation in homomeric  KCNQ1 channels and shifted the voltage dependence of KCNQ1/KCNE1 channel  activation by +30 mV. The mutation furthermore increased the sensitivity of  KCNQ1/KCNE1 channels for bupivacaine 22-fold (KCNQ1wt/KCNE1: IC50 = 2,431 +/-  582 microM, n = 20; KCNQ1A344V/KCNE1: IC50 = 110 +/- 9 microM, n = 24).  Pharmacologic effects of the mutant channels were dominant when mutant and  wild-type channels were coexpressed. Simulation of cardiac action potentials  with the Luo-Rudy model yielded a prolongation of the cardiac action potential  duration and induction of early afterdepolarizations by the mutation A344V that  were aggravated by local anesthetic intoxication. CONCLUSIONS: The results indicate that certain forms of the LQTS may constitute  a specific pharmacogenetic risk factor for regional anesthesia.', 'BACKGROUND: BANK1 and BLK belong to the pleiotropic autoimmune genes; recently,  epistasis between BANK1 and BLK was detected in systemic lupus erythematosus.  Although BLK has been reproducibly identified as a risk factor in rheumatoid  arthritis (RA), reports are conflicting about the contribution of BANK1 to RA  susceptibility. To ascertain the real impact of BANK1 on RA genetic  susceptibility, we performed a large meta-analysis including our original data  and tested for an epistatic interaction between BANK1 and BLK in RA  susceptibility. PATIENTS AND METHODS: We investigated data for 1,915 RA patients and 1,915  ethnically matched healthy controls genotyped for BANK1 rs10516487 and rs3733197  and BLK rs13277113. The association of each SNP and RA was tested by logistic  regression. Multivariate analysis was then used with an interaction term to test  for an epistatic interaction between the SNPs in the 2 genes. RESULTS: None of the SNPs tested individually was significantly associated with  RA in the genotyped samples. However, we detected an epistatic interaction  between BANK1 rs3733197 and BLK rs13277113 (P(interaction) \u200a=\u200a0.037). In  individuals carrying the BLK rs13277113 GG genotype, presence of the BANK1  rs3733197 G allele increased the risk of RA (odds ratio 1.21 [95% confidence  interval 1.04-1.41], P\u200a=\u200a0.015. Combining our results with those of all other  studies in a large trans-ethnic meta-analysis revealed an association of the  BANK1 rs3733197 G allele and RA (1.11 [1.02-1.21], P\u200a=\u200a0.012). CONCLUSION: This study confirms BANK1 as an RA susceptibility gene and for the  first time provides evidence for epistasis between BANK1 and BLK in RA. Our  results illustrate the concept of pleiotropic epistatic interaction, suggesting  that BANK1 and BLK might play a role in RA pathogenesis.', 'Baller-Gerold syndrome (BGS) is a rare autosomal recessive condition with radial  aplasia/hypoplasia and craniosynostosis (OMIM 218600). Of >20 cases reported so  far, a few appear atypical and have been reassigned to other nosologic entities,  including Fanconi anaemia, Roberts SC phocomelia, and Pfeiffer syndromes after  demonstration of corresponding cytogenetic or molecular abnormalities. Clinical  overlap between BGS, Rothmund-Thomson syndrome (RTS), and RAPADILINO syndrome is  noticeable. Because patients with RAPADILINO syndrome and a subset of patients  with RTS have RECQL4 mutations, we reassessed two previously reported BGS  families and found causal mutations in RECQL4 in both. In the first family, four  affected offspring had craniosynostosis and radial defect and one of them  developed poikiloderma. In this family, compound heterozygosity for a R1021W  missense mutation and a g.2886delT frameshift mutation of exon 9 was found. In  the second family, the affected male had craniosynostosis, radial ray defect,  poikiloderma, and short stature. He had a homozygous splice site mutation  (IVS17-2A>C). In both families, the affected offspring had craniosynostosis,  radial defects, and growth retardation, and two developed poikiloderma. Our  results confirm that BGS in a subgroup of patients is due to RECQL4 mutations  and could be integrated into a clinical spectrum that encompasses RTS and  RAPADILINO syndrome.']]]","In ROMANO-WARD syndrome, mutations in the KVLQT1 gene (also known as KCNQ1 and KCNA9) are affected.","[{'Exact': array([ 0.27948288, -2.20774331, -2.70219354,  9.13295833, 57.70762367,

How does PRDM9 recognize the specific DNA motifs for meiotic recombination?,"[[['PRDM9 is essential for the progression through early meiotic prophase, including  double strand break repair, homologous chromosome pairing, and sex body  formation during spermatogenesis. In order to evaluate the association of the  PRDM9 gene variants with defective spermatogenesis in the Chinese Han  population, we assessed two single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) in the PRDM9  gene (rs1874165 and rs2973631) using Sequenom iplex technology in 309 cases of  severely defective spermatogenesis (199 cases with non-obstructive azoospermia  and 110 cases with severe oligozoospermia) and 377 controls. The allele  frequencies of the SNPs were not statistically different between the study  groups and the controls (P =\u20090.95 in rs1874165 and P\u2009=\u20090.80 in rs2973631,  respectively). The genetic model analysis of the two SNPs indicated that these  SNPs variants may not be associated with defective spermatogenesis in the  Chinese Han population.', 'PR domain containing protein 9 (PRDM9) is a meiosis-specific, multi-domain  protein that regulates the location of recombination hotspots by targeting its  DNA recognition sequence for double-strand breaks (DSBs). PRDM9 specifically  recognizes DNA via its tandem array of zinc fingers (ZnFs), epigenetically marks  the local chromatin by its histone methyltransferase activity, and is an  important tether that brings the DNA into contact with the recombination  initiation machinery. A strong correlation between PRDM9-ZnF variants and  specific DNA motifs at recombination hotspots has been reported; however, the  binding specificity and kinetics of the ZnF domain are still obscure. Using two  in vitro methods, gel mobility shift assays and switchSENSE, a quantitative  biophysical approach that measures binding rates in real time, we determined  that the PRDM9-ZnF domain forms a highly stable and long-lived complex with its  recognition sequence, with a dissociation halftime of many hours. The ZnF domain  exhibits an equilibrium dissociation constant (K D) in the nanomolar (nM) range,  with polymorphisms in the recognition sequence directly affecting the binding  affinity. We also determined that alternative sequences (15-16 nucleotides in  length) can be specifically bound by different subsets of the ZnF domain,  explaining the binding plasticity of PRDM9 for different sequences. Finally,  longer binding targets are preferred than predicted from the numbers of ZnFs  contacting the DNA. Functionally, a long-lived complex translates into an  enzymatically active PRDM9 at specific DNA-binding sites throughout meiotic  prophase I that might be relevant in stabilizing the components of the  recombination machinery to a specific DNA target until DSBs are initiated by  Spo11.', ""The DNA-binding protein PRDM9 directs positioning of the double-strand breaks  (DSBs) that initiate meiotic recombination in mice and humans. Prdm9 is the only  mammalian speciation gene yet identified and is responsible for sterility  phenotypes in male hybrids of certain mouse subspecies. To investigate PRDM9  binding and its role in fertility and meiotic recombination, we humanized the  DNA-binding domain of PRDM9 in C57BL/6 mice. This change repositions DSB  hotspots and completely restores fertility in male hybrids. Here we show that  alteration of one Prdm9 allele impacts the behaviour of DSBs controlled by the  other allele at chromosome-wide scales. These effects correlate strongly with  the degree to which each PRDM9 variant binds both homologues at the DSB sites it  controls. Furthermore, higher genome-wide levels of such 'symmetric' PRDM9  binding associate with increasing fertility measures, and comparisons of  individual hotspots suggest binding symmetry plays a downstream role in the  recombination process. These findings reveal that subspecies-specific  degradation of PRDM9 binding sites by meiotic drive, which steadily increases  asymmetric PRDM9 binding, has impacts beyond simply changing hotspot positions,  and strongly support a direct involvement in hybrid infertility. Because such  meiotic drive occurs across mammals, PRDM9 may play a wider, yet transient, role  in the early stages of speciation."", 'BACKGROUND: Genetic recombination plays an important role in evolution,  facilitating the creation of new, favorable combinations of alleles and the  removal of deleterious mutations by unlinking them from surrounding sequences.  In most mammals, the placement of genetic crossovers is determined by the  binding of PRDM9, a highly polymorphic protein with a long zinc finger array, to  its cognate binding sites. It is one of over 800 genes encoding proteins with  zinc finger domains in the human genome. RESULTS: We report a novel technique, Affinity-seq, that for the first time  identifies both the genome-wide binding sites of DNA-binding proteins and  quantitates their relative affinities. We have applied this in vitro technique  to PRDM9, the zinc-finger protein that activates genetic recombination,  obtaining new information on the regulation of hotspots, whose locations and  activities determine the recombination landscape. We identified 31,770 binding  sites in the mouse genome for the PRDM9(Dom2) variant. Comparing these results  with hotspot usage in vivo, we find that less than half of potential PRDM9  binding sites are utilized in vivo. We show that hotspot usage is increased in  actively transcribed genes and decreased in genomic regions containing H3K9me2/3  histone marks or bound to the nuclear lamina. CONCLUSIONS: These results show that a major factor determining whether a  binding site will become an active hotspot and what its activity will be are  constraints imposed by prior chromatin modifications on the ability of PRDM9 to  bind to DNA in vivo. These constraints lead to the presence of long genomic  regions depleted of recombination.', 'The programmed formation of hundreds of DNA double-strand breaks (DSBs) is  essential for proper meiosis and fertility. In mice and humans, the location of  these breaks is determined by the meiosis-specific protein PRDM9, through the  DNA-binding specificity of its zinc-finger domain. PRDM9 also has  methyltransferase activity. Here, we show that this activity is required for  H3K4me3 and H3K36me3 deposition and for DSB formation at PRDM9-binding sites. By  analyzing mice that express two PRDM9 variants with distinct DNA-binding  specificities, we show that each variant generates its own set of H3K4me3 marks  independently from the other variant. Altogether, we reveal several basic  principles of PRDM9-dependent DSB site determination, in which an excess of  sites are designated through PRDM9 binding and subsequent histone methylation,  from which a subset is selected for DSB formation.', ""The onset of prezygotic and postzygotic barriers to gene flow between  populations is a hallmark of speciation. One of the earliest postzygotic  isolating barriers to arise between incipient species is the sterility of the  heterogametic sex in interspecies' hybrids. Four genes that underlie hybrid  sterility have been identified in animals: Odysseus, JYalpha, and Overdrive in  Drosophila and Prdm9 (Meisetz) in mice. Mouse Prdm9 encodes a protein with a  KRAB motif, a histone methyltransferase domain and several zinc fingers. The  difference of a single zinc finger distinguishes Prdm9 alleles that cause hybrid  sterility from those that do not. We find that concerted evolution and positive  selection have rapidly altered the number and sequence of Prdm9 zinc fingers  across 13 rodent genomes. The patterns of positive selection in Prdm9 zinc  fingers imply that rapid evolution has acted on the interface between the Prdm9  protein and the DNA sequences to which it binds. Similar patterns are apparent  for Prdm9 zinc fingers for diverse metazoans, including primates. Indeed,  allelic variation at the DNA-binding positions of human PRDM9 zinc fingers show  significant association with decreased risk of infertility. Prdm9 thus plays a  role in determining male sterility both between species (mouse) and within  species (human). The recurrent episodes of positive selection acting on Prdm9  suggest that the DNA sequences to which it binds must also be evolving rapidly.  Our findings do not identify the nature of the underlying DNA sequences, but  argue against the proposed role of Prdm9 as an essential transcription factor in  mouse meiosis. We propose a hypothetical model in which incompatibilities  between Prdm9-binding specificity and satellite DNAs provide the molecular basis  for Prdm9-mediated hybrid sterility. We suggest that Prdm9 should be  investigated as a candidate gene in other instances of hybrid sterility in  metazoans."", 'Meiotic recombination arises from Rec12/Spo11-dependent formation of DNA  double-strand breaks (DSBs) and their subsequent repair. We identified  Rec12-binding peaks across the Schizosaccharomyces pombe genome using chromatin  immunoprecipitation after reversible formaldehyde cross-linking combined with  whole-genome DNA microarrays. Strong Rec12 binding coincided with previously  identified DSBs at the recombination hotspots ura4A, mbs1, and mbs2 and  correlated with DSB formation at a new site. In addition, Rec12 binding  corresponded to eight novel conversion hotspots and correlated with crossover  density in segments of chromosome I. Notably, Rec12 binding inversely correlated  with guanine-cytosine (GC) content, contrary to findings in Saccharomyces  cerevisiae. Although both replication origins and Rec12-binding sites preferred  AT-rich gene-free regions, they seemed to exclude each other. We also uncovered  a connection between binding sites of Rec12 and meiotic cohesin Rec8.  Rec12-binding peaks lay often within 2.5 kb of a Rec8-binding peak. Rec12  binding showed preference for large intergenic regions and was found to bind  preferentially near to genes expressed strongly in meiosis. Surprisingly, Rec12  binding was also detected in centromeric core regions, which raises the  intriguing possibility that Rec12 plays additional roles in meiotic chromosome  dynamics.', ""In mammals, meiotic recombination occurs at 1- to 2-kb genomic regions termed  hotspots, whose positions and activities are determined by PRDM9, a DNA-binding  histone methyltransferase. We show that the KRAB domain of PRDM9 forms complexes  with additional proteins to allow hotspots to proceed into the next phase of  recombination. By a combination of yeast-two hybrid assay, in vitro binding, and  coimmunoprecipitation from mouse spermatocytes, we identified four proteins that  directly interact with PRDM9's KRAB domain, namely CXXC1, EWSR1, EHMT2, and  CDYL. These proteins are coexpressed in spermatocytes at the early stages of  meiotic prophase I, the limited period when PRDM9 is expressed. We also detected  association of PRDM9-bound complexes with the meiotic cohesin REC8 and the  synaptonemal complex proteins SYCP3 and SYCP1. Our results suggest a model in  which PRDM9-bound hotspot DNA is brought to the chromosomal axis by the action  of these proteins, ensuring the proper chromatin and spatial environment for  subsequent recombination events."", 'BACKGROUND: Genetic recombination plays an important role in evolution,  facilitating the creation of new, favorable combinations of alleles and the  removal of deleterious mutations by unlinking them from surrounding sequences.

How the locations of breaks are specified was  largely unknown until a fortuitous confluence of statistical genetics and  molecular biology uncovered the role of PRDM9, a DNA binding protein. Many  properties of this protein remain mysterious, however, including how it binds to  DNA, how it contributes to male infertility-both in humans, and in hybrid  mice-and why, in spite of its fundamental function in meiosis, its binding  domain varies extensively among humans and across mammals. We present a brief  summary of what has recently been learned about PRDM9 in different fields,  focusing on the puzzles yet to be resolved.']]]","PRDM9 recognizes specific DNA motifs for meiotic recombination through its tandem array of zinc fingers (ZnFs). Each ZnF domain in PRDM9 has high affinity for particular DNA sequences, allowing it to bind to specific recognition sequences. The exact DNA motifs recognized by PRDM9 are determined by the sequence of these zinc finger domains. PRDM9's ability to bind to these motifs is influenced by polymorphisms in the recognition sequence, which can affect the binding affinity. The binding specificity and kinetics of the ZnF domain are still being studied, but it is known that PRDM9 forms a stable and long-lived complex with its recognition sequence, indicating that it can effectively locate and bind to the desired DNA targets for meiotic recombination.","[{'Exact': array([  1.41519393, 147.35162434,   4.79473647,   4.29642678,

Can clonidine be used to reduce agitation in children.,"[[['Failure of dental treatment due to anxiety is a common problem in children. The  aim of this study was to establish whether the use of a combination of  intravenous midazolam with inhalation agents (nitrous oxide alone or in  combination with sevoflurane) was any more likely to result in successful  completion of treatment than midazolam alone. A further aim was to evaluate the  clinical viability of these techniques as an alternative to general anaesthesia.  In total, 697 children too anxious for management with relative analgesia and  requiring invasive dental procedure for which a general anaesthetic would  usually be required, were recruited and randomly assigned to one of three groups  given the following interventions: group 1 - a combination of inhaled medical  air and titrated intravenous midazolam, group 2 - a combination of inhaled 40%  nitrous oxide in oxygen and titrated intravenous midazolam, and group 3 - a  combination of an inhaled mixture of sevoflurane 0.3% and nitrous oxide 40% in  oxygen with titrated intravenous midazolam. The primary outcome measure was  successful completion of the intended dental treatment with a co-operative child  responsive to verbal commands. In group 1, 54% (94/174 children) successfully  completed treatment. In group 2, 80% (204/256 children) and in group 3, 93%  (249/267 children) completed treatment. This difference was significant at the  1% level. Intravenous midazolam, especially in combination with inhaled nitrous  oxide or sevoflurane and nitrous oxide, are effective techniques, with the  combination of midazolam and sevoflurane the one most likely to result in  successful treatment.', 'Clonidine is experiencing increasing use in the pediatric population as a  sedative and analgesic because of its central alpha2-adrenergic agonism. We  report three cases of preoperative use of intranasal clonidine in pediatric  patients, all for different indications. One patient was treated for  preoperative agitation and hallucinations associated with oral midazolam. One  patient was given clonidine as a premedicant. The third patient was treated for  preoperative agitation and hypertension. All three patients had subjective  resolution of indicated symptoms and none experienced adverse outcomes.', 'OBJECTIVE: To evaluate safety and tolerability of four doses of  immediate-release molindone hydrochloride in children with  attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) and serious conduct problems. METHODS: This open-label, parallel-group, dose-ranging, multicenter trial  randomized children, aged 6-12 years, with ADHD and persistent, serious conduct  problems to receive oral molindone thrice daily for 9-12 weeks in four treatment  groups: Group 1-10 mg (5 mg if weight <30 kg), group 2-20 mg (10 mg if <30 kg),  group 3-30 mg (15 mg if <30 kg), and group 4-40 mg (20 mg if <30 kg). The  primary outcome measure was to evaluate safety and tolerability of molindone in  children with ADHD and serious conduct problems. Secondary outcome measures  included change in Nisonger Child Behavior Rating Form-Typical Intelligence  Quotient (NCBRF-TIQ) Conduct Problem subscale scores, change in Clinical Global  Impressions-Severity (CGI-S) and -Improvement (CGI-I) subscale scores from  baseline to end point, and Swanson, Nolan, and Pelham rating scale-revised  (SNAP-IV) ADHD-related subscale scores. RESULTS: The study randomized 78 children; 55 completed the study. Treatment  with molindone was generally well tolerated, with no clinically meaningful  changes in laboratory or physical examination findings. The most common  treatment-related adverse events (AEs) included somnolence (n=9), weight  increase (n=8), akathisia (n=4), sedation (n=4), and abdominal pain (n=4). Mean  weight increased by 0.54 kg, and mean body mass index by 0.24 kg/m(2). The  incidence of AEs and treatment-related AEs increased with increasing dose.  NCBRF-TIQ subscale scores improved in all four treatment groups, with 34%, 34%,  32%, and 55% decreases from baseline in groups 1, 2, 3, and 4, respectively.  CGI-S and SNAP-IV scores improved over time in all treatment groups, and CGI-I  scores improved to the greatest degree in group 4. CONCLUSIONS: Molindone at doses of 5-20 mg/day (children weighing <30 kg) and  20-40 mg (≥ 30 kg) was well tolerated, and preliminary efficacy results suggest  that molindone produces dose-related behavioral improvements over 9-12 weeks.  Additional double-blind, placebo-controlled trials are needed to further  investigate molindone in this pediatric population.', 'Young children with fragile X syndrome (FXS) often experience anxiety,  irritability, and hyperactivity related to sensory hyperarousal. However, there  are no medication recommendations with documented efficacy for children under 5  years old of age with FXS. We examined data through a chart review for 45  children with FXS, 12-50 months old, using the Mullen Scales of Early Learning  (MSEL) for baseline and longitudinal assessments. All children had clinical  level of anxiety, language delays based on MSEL scores, and similar early  learning composite (ELC) scores at their first visit to our clinic. Incidence of  autism spectrum disorder (ASD) was similar in both groups. There were 11  children who were treated with sertraline, and these patients were  retrospectively compared to 34 children who were not treated with sertraline by  chart review. The baseline assessments were done at ages ranging from 18 to 44  months (mean 26.9, SD 7.99) and from 12 to 50 months (mean 29.94, SD 8.64) for  treated and not treated groups, respectively. Mean rate of improvement in both  expressive and receptive language development was significantly higher in the  group who was treated with sertraline (P < 0.0001 and P = 0.0071, resp.). This  data supports the need for a controlled trial of sertraline treatment in young  children with FXS.', 'A family-based, cognitive behavioural treatment for anxiety in 47 children with  comorbid anxiety disorders and High Functioning Autism Spectrum Disorder (HFA)  was evaluated. Treatment involved 12 weekly group sessions and was compared with  a waiting list condition. Changes between pre- and post-treatment were examined  using clinical interviews as well as child-, parent- and teacher-report  measures. Following treatment, 71.4% of the treated participants no longer  fulfilled diagnostic criteria for an anxiety disorder. Comparisons between the  two conditions indicated significant reductions in anxiety symptoms as measured  by self-report, parent report and teacher report. Discussion focuses on the  implications for the use of cognitive behaviour therapy with HFA children, for  theory of mind research and for further research on the treatment components.', 'Although the etiology of neurodevelopmental mental disorders remains obscure,  converging lines of evidence using animal modeling suggest a critical role for  activity-dependent neurodevelopmental processes during neonatal life. Here, we  report the behavioral effects of a novel technique designed to induce targeted,  transient disruption of activity-dependent processes in early development via  reduction of calcium-mediated neurotransmitter release. We examined the  post-pubertal behavioral effects of neonatal (postnatal day 7) medial prefrontal  cortex infusion of either vehicle or N-type and P/Q-type presynaptic  voltage-dependent calcium channel blockers (omega-conotoxins MVIIA and MVIIC  respectively; 6.8 and 45 pmol infused respectively) in rat pups. In a test of  amphetamine-induced behavioral sensitization, neonatal omega-conotoxin MVIIA  treatment significantly increased locomotion following repeated amphetamine  injections (1.5 mg/kg i.p.) and significantly decreased locomotion following  repeated saline injections relative to animals treated neonatally with vehicle.  However, there was no effect of conotoxin treatment on the long-term expression  of amphetamine sensitization. Neonatal treatment with omega-conotoxins had no  effect on the other behaviors assayed, namely, acoustic startle response,  prepulse inhibition of startle, novelty- and amphetamine-induced (1.5 mg/kg  i.p.) locomotion, and anxiety-like behavior in the elevated plus-maze. These  data confirm that transient, region-specific disruption of synaptic transmission  during early development can have long-term effects on behaviors relevant to  neurodevelopmental mental disorders.', ""BACKGROUND: This randomized, double-blind study tested the hypothesis that, in  comparison with midazolam, premedication with oral clonidine reduces the  incidence of emergence agitation in preschool children anaesthetized with  sevoflurane. METHODS: Sixty-eight ASA I-II children undergoing circumcision were randomized  into three groups to receive different oral premedication given 30 min before  anaesthesia: midazolam 0.5 mg kg-1, clonidine 2 microg kg-1, and clonidine 4  microg kg-1. Sevoflurane anaesthesia was administered via a facemask (O2/N2O:  40/60). Analgesia was with penile block (bupivacaine 0.5% 0.3 ml kg-1) and  rectal paracetamol (30 mg kg-1). During the first postoperative hour, children  were evaluated using a modified 'objective pain scale'. RESULTS: Only the 4 microg kg-1 dose of clonidine was associated with a  significant reduction in emergence agitation. Fewer children in the clonidine 4  microg kg-1 group displayed agitation (25%) than in the midazolam group (60%)  (P=0.025). Incidence of hypotension and bradycardia, time to first micturition  and first drink did not differ among groups. CONCLUSIONS: In comparison with midazolam, clonidine 4 microg kg-1 reduced  sevoflurane-induced emergence agitation without increasing postoperative  side-effects."", 'BACKGROUND: Sevoflurane is commonly used as an inhalational induction agent in  paediatric patients. Emergence agitation is a common post-operative problem in  young children who have received sevoflurane. Clonidine has proven to be  effective in reducing the incidence of post-operative agitation at a higher dose  (3 and 2 μg kg⁻¹). It has some dose-dependent disadvantages, prominently  bradycardia, hypotension and respiratory impairment. OBJECTIVE: The authors conducted a study to evaluate the effectiveness of  low-dose caudal clonidine (1 μg kg⁻¹) in reducing the incidence of  sevoflurane-induced agitation in preschool children undergoing urogenital and  lower limb surgery. METHODOLOGY: A double-blind study was conducted comparing 0.25% (0.75 ml kg⁻¹)  bupivacaine and clonidine 1 μg kg⁻¹ (group 1), 0.25% bupivacaine (0.75 ml kg⁻¹)  and clonidine 0.75 μg kg⁻¹ (group 2), with 0.25% bupivacaine (0.75 ml kg⁻¹)  alone (group 3). Ninety children of 1-5 years of American Society of  Anesthesiologists I and II were randomly assigned into three groups.  Post-operatively, patients were monitored for 1 h to observe emergence  agitation, which was assessed with the help of Pain and Discomfort Scale. RESULT: Post-anaesthetic agitation was observed in two patients (6.6%) in group  1, eight patients (26.6%) in group 2 as compared to 12 patients (40%) in group 3  after 15 min of post-operative observation. The mean scores in group 1 at 15 and  30 min were significantly lower than those in group 3 (P value <0.05). None of  the groups had showed any haemodynamic and respiratory compromise, either  clinically and statistically. CONCLUSION: Caudal clonidine at a lower dose (1 μg kg⁻¹) could be effective in  reducing the incidence of sevoflurane-induced emergence agitation in children  undergoing urogenital and lower limb surgery without any significant adverse  effects.', 'BACKGROUND: In children, sevoflurane anaesthesia is associated with  postanaesthetic agitation, which is treated mainly with opioids. We compared the  effectiveness of epidural and i.v. clonidine in the prevention of this  postanaesthetic agitation. METHODS: Eighty children aged 3-8 yr (ASA I-II) received standardized general  anaesthesia with inhaled sevoflurane and caudal epidural block with 0.175%  bupivacaine 1 ml kg-1 for minor surgery. The children were assigned randomly to  four groups: (I) clonidine 1 microgram kg-1 added to caudal bupivacaine; (II)  clonidine 3 micrograms kg-1 added to caudal bupivacaine; (III) clonidine 3  micrograms kg-1 i.v. and caudal bupivacaine; and (IV) caudal block with  bupivacaine, no clonidine (control). A blinded observer assessed the behaviour  of the children during the first postoperative hour. Secondary end-points were  the time to fitness for discharge from the postanaesthesia care unit, and  haemodynamic and respiratory variables. RESULTS: The incidence of agitation was 22, 0, 5 and 39% in groups I, II, III  and IV respectively (P < 0.05 for groups II and III compared with group IV).  During the first hour after surgery, patients in groups II and III had  significantly lower scores for agitation than group IV patients. Time to fitness  for discharge did not differ between the four groups. CONCLUSIONS: Clonidine 3 micrograms kg-1 prevented agitation after sevoflurane  anaesthesia, independently of the route of administration. The effect of  clonidine appears to be dose-dependent, as an epidural dose of 1 microgram kg-1  failed to reduce it.', ""BACKGROUND: This double-blind randomized study was undertaken to assess  agitation, Bispectral Index (BIS) and EEG changes during induction of  anaesthesia with sevoflurane in children premedicated with midazolam or  clonidine. METHODS: Children were allocated randomly to receive rectal midazolam 0.4 mg  kg(-1) (n=20) or oral clonidine 4 microg kg(-1) (n=20) as premedication. Rapid  induction of anaesthesia was achieved with inhalation of sevoflurane 8% in  nitrous oxide 50%-oxygen 50%. After tracheal intubation, the children's lungs  were mechanically ventilated and the inspired sevoflurane concentration was  adjusted to achieve an end-tidal fraction of 2.5%. The EEG and BIS were recorded  during induction until 10 min after tracheal intubation. The EEG was analysed  using spectral analysis at five points: baseline, loss of eyelash reflex, 15 s  before the nadir of the BIS (BIS(nadir)), when both pupils returned to the  central position (immediately before intubation), and 10 min after intubation. RESULTS: Agitation was observed in 12 midazolam-treated and five  clonidine-treated patients (P=0.05). At baseline, EEG rhythms were slower in the  clonidine group. Induction of anaesthesia was associated with similar EEG  changes in the two groups, with an increase in total spectral power and a shift  towards low frequencies; these changes were maximal around the end of the second  minute of induction (BIS(nadir)). When the pupils had returned to the central  position, fast EEG rhythms increased and BIS was higher than BIS(nadir)  (P<0.05). In both groups, agitation was associated with an increase in slow EEG  rhythms at BIS(nadir). CONCLUSIONS: Compared with midazolam, clonidine premedication reduced agitation  during sevoflurane induction. During induction with sevoflurane 8% (oxygen  50%-nitrous oxide 50%), the nadir of the BIS occurred at the end of the second  minute of inhalation. Agitation was associated with a more pronounced slowing of  the EEG rhythms at BIS(nadir) compared with inductions in which no agitation was  observed. The BIS may not follow the depth of anaesthesia during sevoflurane  induction in children.""]]]","Yes, clonidine can be used to reduce agitation in children. The studies mentioned show that clonidine, especially at lower doses, can effectively reduce post-operative agitation in children under anesthesia, particularly when used as a premedication.","[{'Exact': array([ 0.89380434, 11.2159976 ,  1.42688121,  0.40413389, -0.43492076,

What is evaluated with the Hydrocephalus Outcome Questionnaire?,"[[['This study exampled the properties of a child-completed version of the  Hydrocephalus Outcome Questionnaire (cHOQ) and compared these with parental  responses to the HOQ (parent version). This was a cross-sectional study in the  outpatient clinics at three Canadian paediatric hospitals (Toronto, Vancouver,  and Halifax). All cognitively-capable children with previously treated  hydrocephalus who were aged between 6 and 19 years were eligible. Parents  completed the HOQ and the Health Utilities Index Mark 3; children completed the  cHOQ. A total of 273 children participated (146 males, 127 females; mean age 14  y 1 mo, SD 2 y 7 mo). Internal consistency of the cHOQ was 0.93 and test-retest  reliability was 0.86 (95% confidence interval 0.78-0.92). Mother-child agreement  and father-child agreement were 0.57 (0.40-0.68) and 0.62 (0.48-0.73)  respectively. Agreement was higher for assessments of physical health, but lower  for assessments of cognitive health and social-emotional health. There was  greater parent-child agreement for older children. When there was disagreement,  it seemed that children tended to rate their health better than their parents  did. In older children with hydrocephalus, the cHOQ appears to be a  scientifically reliable means of assessing long-term outcome. The differences in  child and parent perceptions of health need to be appreciated when conducting  outcome studies in this population.', 'PURPOSE: We evaluated the relationships between the cerebral metabolic rate of  glucose (CMRglu) measured by dynamic (18)F-fluorodeoxyglucose (FDG) positron  emission tomography/computed tomography (PET/CT) and the clinical and  neuropsychological assessment before and after the surgical procedure in  idiopathic normal pressure hydrocephalus (INPH) patients. METHODS: Eleven selected INPH patients underwent clinical assessment (modified  Rankin scale, Krauss scale, Larsson categorization system and Stein-Langfitt  scale), cognitive evaluation (Mini-Mental State Examination, MMSE) and dynamic  (18)F-FDG PET/CT scan 3 days before and 1 week after ventricular shunt  placement. RESULTS: After shunting, the global CMRglu significantly increased (2.95 ± 0.44  vs 4.38 ± 0.68, p = 10(-7)) in all INPH patients with a mean percentage value of  48.7%. After shunting, no significant change was found in the Evans ratio  whereas a significant decrease in all clinical scale scores was observed. Only a  slight reduction in the MMSE was found. After shunting, a significant  correlation between the global CMRglu value and clinical assessment was found (R  (2)\u2009= 0.75, p = 0.024); indeed all clinical scale scores varied (decreasing) and  the CMRglu value also varied (increasing) in all INPH patients. CONCLUSION: Our preliminary data show that changes in the CMRglu are promptly  reversible after surgery and that there is a relationship between the early  metabolic changes and clinical symptoms, independently from the simultaneous  changes in the ventricular size. The remarkable and prompt improvement in the  global CMRglu and in symptoms may also have important implications for the  current concept of ""neuronal plasticity"" and for the cells\' reactivity in order  to recover their metabolic function.', 'PURPOSE: In the current literature, there are essentially no comparisons of  quality of life (QOL) outcome after endoscopic third ventriculostomy (ETV) and  shunt in childhood hydrocephalus. Our objective was to compare QOL in children  with obstructive hydrocephalus, treated with either ETV or shunt. METHODS: A cross-sectional survey was conducted at SickKids, Toronto of children  between ages five and 18 years, with obstructive hydrocephalus due to aqueductal  obstruction and no other brain abnormalities. Measures of QOL were the  Hydrocephalus Outcome Questionnaire and the Health Utilities Index Mark 3. A  subset of patients was given the Wechsler Intelligence Scales for Children  (WISC-IV). RESULTS: A total of 47 of 59 (80%) eligible patients participated (24 had ETV as  primary treatment, 23 had shunt as primary treatment), with a mean age of 12.1  years (standard deviation 3.9) at assessment. The ETV group was older at initial  surgery (p < 0.001) and had larger ventricle size at last follow-up (p = 0.047).  In all QOL measures, there were no significant differences between the ETV group  and shunt group (all p > or = 0.09). Treatment failure, hydrocephalus  complications, and the presence of a functioning ETV at assessment were not  associated with QOL differences. Among the 11 children (six ETV, five shunt) who  were given the WISC-IV, there were no significant differences between the scores  of the ETV group and shunt group (all p > or = 0.11). CONCLUSIONS: This is the first study to provide a meaningful comparison of QOL  after ETV and shunt in children. These preliminary results suggest that there is  no obvious difference in QOL after ETV and shunt.', ""OBJECTIVE: To compare three separate methods for establishing interpretability  for a health status measure, the Hydrocephalus Outcome Questionnaire (HOQ). STUDY DESIGN AND SETTING: The mothers of children with hydrocephalus attending  the outpatient clinics at a pediatric hospital completed the HOQ (for which  scores can range from 0 to 1.0 with the smallest possible incremental change  being .005), the Health Utilities Index-2 (HUI-2), and a global rating of their  child's health. The surgeon for the child also provided a global rating of the  child's health following their visit. These data were used to calculate (i) the  minimal important difference (MID) based on global health ratings, (ii) the MID  based on an effect size approach, and (iii) the conversion of numerical HOQ  scores into health utility scores obtained from the HUI-2. RESULTS: Based on mothers' responses (n = 79) and surgeons' responses (n = 61),  respectively, the MID for the HOQ was estimated to be .12 and .10. Using the  effect size approach, the MID was estimated to be much lower at .03. HOQ scores  were found to be readily translatable to HUI-2 utility scores using a simple  linear transformation. The mean utility score for this sample of patients was  .77. CONCLUSIONS: Two methods for determining the MID yielded quantitatively  different results. Conversion of numerical health status scores to utility  scores was done successfully and providing another element of interpretability."", 'INTRODUCTION: Idiopathic normal pressure hydrocephalus is a disease that most  frequently concerns subjects of an advanced age. It is not easy to establish a  definitive diagnosis, and the practitioner frequently encounters decision-making  problems regarding the following question: should a shunt be performed, or not?  Opinions remain contradictory, even though the available scientific data is  increasingly precise. The aim of this review is to analyze the physiopathogenic,  clinical, paraclinical and therapeutic data associated with this type of  hydrocephalus. CURRENT KNOWLEDGE AND KEY POINTS: If the clinical triad is determinant, no other  investigation is in fact necessary to confirm the diagnosis, although it should  always be questioned in the case of ventricular enlargement determined by  tomodensitometry. The decision to perform the only efficient procedure, i.e., a  ventricular shunt operation, depends upon a number of established arguments in  favor of that procedure. Clinical improvement, which is often spectacular, can  then confirm the diagnosis. FUTURE PROSPECTS AND PROJECTS: The efficacy of surgical treatment has been  confirmed by clinical studies, and there is a reduced tendency as regards  post-operative complications. However, each case should be considered  individually and with the cooperation of and coordination between the family,  the physician and the neurosurgeon.', ""OBJECT: The Hydrocephalus Outcome Questionnaire (HOQ) is an established means of  measuring quality of life, but the cognitive component of this questionnaire has  never been formally compared with gold-standard neuropsychological test scores.  The authors hypothesized that the HOQ Cognitive Health score would demonstrate a  relatively strong correlation with neuropsychological test scores, whereas much  weaker correlations would be seen for HOQ Physical and Social-Emotional Health  scores. METHODS: A cross-sectional study of children with long-standing hydrocephalus  presenting to The Hospital for Sick Children's Neurosurgery Clinic was performed  between July 2006 and September 2008. Participating children and families  completed the HOQ and a battery of 21 standard neuropsychological tests and  questionnaires. Pearson correlation analysis was then performed. RESULTS: A total of 83 patients (81% participation) was accrued; the mean age  was 11.5 ± 3.4 years (mean ± SD) at the time of assessment. The mean age at  hydrocephalus treatment was 1.3 ± 2.6 years. The mean overall HOQ score was 0.69  ± 0.21. The HOQ Cognitive score had a moderate or strong correlation with 19  (90%) of 21 neuropsychological test scores, much more so than the HOQ  Social-Emotional score (5 moderate or strong correlations, 24%) and the HOQ  Physical score (1 moderate correlation, 5%). For 19 neuropsychological tests  (90%), the HOQ Cognitive score had a stronger correlation than the other scores.  The HOQ Cognitive score had particularly strong correlations with the Verbal IQ,  List Learning, Behavior Problems, and Metacognitive Abilities components. CONCLUSIONS: Data from a wide-ranging representative sample of children with  long-standing hydrocephalus provide added evidence of the validity of the HOQ  Cognitive score and the overall domain structure of the HOQ itself."", 'The definition of normal pressure hydrocephalus (NPH), in adults, associates  clinical signs (Adams and Hakim triad) involving gait disorders, urinary  incontinence and dementia, associated with aspects on brain imaging that are  consistent with this hypothesis and also normal or slightly increased  intracranial pressure. The aim of this study was to clarify the techniques and  methods facilitating the diagnosis of NPH. The literature review has been  conducted from the Medline database without date limitation including the  keywords ""normal pressure hydrocephalus"" and ""diagnosis."" They should appear in  the article title. From the 43 initially sorted, only 13 have been selected  using exclusion criteria. The proposed methods are very sparse and focused on  the improvement after surgical shunt. This focus is independent from the  diagnosis criteria proposed in 2005. This introduces an ambiguity in the  interpretation of the results. In practice, the diagnosis of NPH is more  difficult in the elderly population where differential diagnoses are frequent,  particularly vascular lesions (notably microangiopathy) and Alzheimer\'s disease.  The more invasive techniques as continuous spinal drainage (usually during 3  days) or some features of CSF dynamics (Rout, compliance) seem to be the best  predictors of after shunt improvement. However, these techniques are difficult  to use in routine in the elderly. The combination of Evans index and corpus  callosum angle on MRI is very useful to improve the differential diagnosis with  cerebral atrophy. Spinal tap test (lumbar puncture with the removal of 40 mL of  CSF) can be repeated two or three times for consecutive days to improve the  predictive value before shunting. Gait and balance often improve after shunt,  more than cognition and bladder disorders. In the elderly population, the  prognosis after 3 years is non conclusive despite initial improvement. Poor  prognosis seems to be due to associated pathologies in particular  neurodegenerative diseases. This should be considered in decision-making of CSF  shunt.', 'PURPOSE: The long-term outcome in spina bifida-Chiari II-hydrocephalus complex  is poorly understood. Traditional neurosurgical outcome measures are crude.  Neuropsychological testing is increasingly important in outcome assessment. We  investigated the health, disability, lifestyle and cognitive function in adults  who had myelomeningocoele closure at birth. METHODS: Adult patients under routine follow-up were assessed in a joint  neurosurgery/neuropsychology clinic. Patients completed lifestyle  questionnaires, the hydrocephalus outcome questionnaire (HOQ) and underwent  cognitive testing. Clinical variables including number of shunt revisions, shunt  infection and surgical decompression of foramen magnum, which may influence  outcome, were investigated. RESULTS: Twenty-one adults with a median age of 35 years were investigated. All  had treated hydrocephalus, and eight had foramen magnum decompression for  headache or progressive brainstem symptoms with stabilisation of symptoms in  seven and improvement in one. Only eight patients were living independently,  five were in paid employment and five work voluntarily. HOQ scores for cognitive  function were lower (0.56 ± 0.20; mean ± standard deviation (SD)) than those for  physical (0.64 ± 0.15) and social-emotional (0.65 ± 0.17) health. Cognitive  function varied across the cohort with attention most severely affected (73.9 ±  17.0; mean ± SD). Repeated episodes of shunt malfunction or foramen magnum  decompression were not associated with a worse cognitive function. CONCLUSIONS: Despite intervention in childhood and adequate cerebrospinal fluid  diversion the prognosis for independent living into adulthood remains poor. All  patients have elements of cognitive impairment. Structural brain abnormalities  may be more important determinants of cognitive outcome than shunt malfunction.', 'PURPOSE: We prospectively evaluated the regional cerebral metabolic rate of  glucose (CMRglu) before and after ventricular shunt placement in idiopathic  normal-pressure hydrocephalus (iNPH) patients, to investigate whether some brain  regions are more involved than others; we also correlated the individual  variations of CMRglu with the clinical scale score assessment after shunting. METHODS: Twenty iNPH patients (12 men; mean age 73 ± 9 years) underwent clinical  scale score assessment and F-FDG PET-CT before and 1 week after shunting. RESULTS: Before shunting, CMRglu values were similar in right and left brain  regions, as well as after shunting. After shunting, 17 of 20 iNPH patients were  clinically improved; all scale scores decreased, and CMRglu significantly  increased in all regions (P < 10). In 3 of 20 iNPH patients, the symptoms  persisted, the scale scores did not change, and CMRglu increased only in 3  regions: left frontal, left putamen, and right thalamus. Before shunting, no  difference in global CMRglu between clinically improved (n = 17) and not  improved (n = 3) iNPH patients was found. After shunting, a significant (P =  0.01) correlation between individual variations of CMRglu and clinical  assessment was found. CONCLUSIONS: These findings confirm that iNPH is a disease involving all  cerebral regions almost in the same way, and shunt procedure has a similar  effect on regional cerebral metabolism almost in the same way. Individual  variations of CMRglu are more important than absolute values and correlate with  clinical status after shunting. Clinical improvement depends not only on the  capability to restore the cerebrospinal fluid dynamic, but also on the ability  of cerebral parenchyma to recover the metabolic function.', ""OBJECTIVES/HYPOTHESIS: Sinonasal Outcomes Test-22 (SNOT-22) is used widely as a  patient-reported sinonasal quality-of-life (QOL) instrument for endoscopic  endonasal pituitary surgery. However, it has never been validated in this  population. This study explores the psychometric validity of SNOT-22 to  determine if it is a valid scale in patients undergoing endoscopic pituitary  surgery. STUDY DESIGN: Multicenter prospective trial. METHODS: Adult patients (n\xa0=\xa0113) with pituitary tumors undergoing endoscopic  surgery were enrolled in a multicenter study. Patient-reported QOL was assessed  using SNOT-22 and the Anterior Skull Base Nasal Inventory-12. Face validity,  internal consistency, responsiveness to clinical change, test-retest  reliability, and concurrent validity were determined using standard statistical  methods. RESULTS: Internal consistency using Cronbach's alpha at baseline and 2\u2009weeks  postoperatively were 0.911 and 0.922, indicating SNOT-22 performed well as a  single construct. Mean QOL scores were significantly worse at 2\u2009weeks than  baseline (16.4\u2009±\u200915.1 vs. 23.1\u2009±\u200916.4, P\u2009<\u2009.001), indicating the scale is  responsive to clinical change. However, only 11/22 items demonstrated  significant changes in mean scores at 2\u2009weeks. Correlation between scores at 2  and 3\u2009weeks was high, suggesting good test-retest reliability, r(107)\xa0=\xa00.75,  P\u2009<\u2009.001. Factor analysis suggests the five-factor solution proposed for the  SNOT-22 in rhinosinusitis patients is not valid in pituitary surgery patients. CONCLUSIONS: The SNOT-22 is a valid QOL instrument in patients undergoing  endoscopic pituitary surgery. However, because it includes 22 items, can be  applied only as a single construct, 50% of the items do not demonstrate changes  after surgery, and is not as sensitive to change as other scales, shorter  instruments developed specifically for this patient population may be  preferable.

Which is the most prevalent form of arrhythmia worldwide?,"[[['INTRODUCTION AND OBJECTIVES: Atrial fibrillation is the most prevalent sustained  arrhythmia. This paper estimates the burden and cost of illness attributable to  atrial fibrillation in Portugal based on demographic and health statistics. METHODS: Mortality data by cause of death came from the European Detailed  Mortality Database of the World Health Organization (WHO). Hospital data were  taken from the Portuguese diagnosis-related groups database. The burden of  disease was measured using DALYs (disability-adjusted life years), a metric  adopted by the WHO. Costs studied included resource use and lost productivity.  The burden and cost of illness are those attributable to atrial fibrillation and  its main complication, ischemic stroke. RESULTS: In Portugal, 4070 deaths were attributable to atrial fibrillation in  2010, corresponding to 3.8% of all deaths. In total, the burden of disease  attributable to atrial fibrillation was estimated at 23,084 DALYs: 10,521  resulting from premature deaths (1.7% of the total DALYs due to death in 2010 in  Portugal), and 12,563 resulting from disability. The total estimated direct  costs attributable to atrial fibrillation at 2013 prices were €115 million: €34  million for inpatient care and €81 million for outpatient care. Indirect costs  resulting from lost production due to disability were estimated at €25 million. CONCLUSIONS: Atrial fibrillation has an important social impact in Portugal due  to its associated mortality and morbidity, and was responsible in 2013 for a  total cost of €140 million, about 0.08% of gross domestic product.', ""Atrial fibrillation is the most common arrhythmia affecting patients today.  Disease prevalence is increasing at an alarming rate worldwide, and is  associated with often catastrophic and costly consequences, including heart  failure, syncope, dementia, and stroke. Therapies including anticoagulants,  anti-arrhythmic medications, devices, and non-pharmacologic procedures in the  last 30 years have improved patients' functionality with the disease.  Nonetheless, it remains imperative that further research into AF epidemiology,  genetics, detection, and treatments continues to push forward rapidly as the  worldwide population ages dramatically over the next 20 years."", 'BACKGROUND: Bidirectional ventricular tachycardia (BVT), which is characterized  by an alternating beat-to-beat ECG QRS axis, is a rare but intriguing arrhythmia  associated with digitalis toxicity, familial catecholaminergic polymorphic  ventricular tachycardia (CPVT), and several other conditions that predispose  cardiac myocytes to delayed afterdepolarizations (DADs) and triggered activity.  Evidence from human and animal studies attributes BVT to alternating ectopic  foci originating from the distal His-Purkinje system in the left and/or right  ventricle, respectively. OBJECTIVE: The purpose of this study was to evaluate a simple ""ping pong"" model  of reciprocating bigeminy to explain BVT. METHODS: We constructed a two-dimensional anatomic model of the rabbit  ventricles with a simplified His-Purkinje system, in which different sites in  the His-Purkinje system had different heart rate thresholds for DAD-induced  bigeminy. RESULTS: When the heart rate exceeded the threshold for bigeminy at the first  site in the His-Purkinje system, ventricular bigeminy developed, causing the  heart rate to accelerate and exceed the threshold for bigeminy at the second  site. Thus, the triggered beat from the first site induced a triggered beat from  the second site. The triggered beat from the second site next reciprocated by  inducing a triggered beat from the first site, and so forth. Bigeminy from two  sites produced BVT, and that from three or more sites produced polymorphic VT. CONCLUSION: This ""ping pong"" mechanism of reciprocating bigeminy readily  produces the characteristic ECG pattern of BVT and its degeneration to  polymorphic VT if additional sites develop bigeminy.', 'BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: Nocturnal cardiac arrhythmias occur in patients with  obstructive sleep apnea (OSA), reportedly as a consequence of the autonomic  effects of recurrent apnea with subsequent oxygen desaturation. We have  investigated whether different patterns of OSA are associated with specific  arrhythmia during sleep. PATIENTS AND METHODS: Electrocardiographic (ECG) data recorded during  polysomnography (PSG) were analysed in 257 consecutive OSA patients to determine  the prevalence of cardiac rhythm disturbances, and to relate these to breathing  pattern (normal, apnea/hypopnea, recovering ventilation, snoring) and oxygen  saturation. RESULTS: Arrhythmias were found in 18.5% of patients. Patients with nocturnal  bradyarrhythmia (BA) had higher values of ventilatory disturbance  (apnea-hypopnea index [AHI] 58.8+/-36.8 vs 37.2+/-30.3, p=0.02), mean  desaturation amplitude (8.9+/-4 vs 5.9+/-3.4%, p=0.03), and a lower SaO(2) nadir  (69% vs 77%, p=0.003) than those without arrhythmia. The prevalence of BA in  patients with AHI>or=30/h was significantly higher than that observed in those  with AHI<30/h (7.8% vs 1.5%, respectively; chi(2)=5.61, p=0.01). In contrast,  patients with tachyarrhythmia (TA) had no significant differences in AHI, mean  desaturation amplitude or SaO(2) nadir than those without arrhythmia. No  associations were found between arrhythmia and the presence of comorbidity or  concomitant medical therapy, except for an association between tachyarrhythmia  and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) (odds ratio 2.53; 95%  confidence intervals 1.1-5.8, p=0.03). CONCLUSIONS: We conclude that while BA during sleep is associated with OSA  severity, concomitant COPD or beta(2)-treatment may play a role in the  development of TA during sleep.', 'INTRODUCTION AND OBJECTIVES: Catecholaminergic polymorphic ventricular  tachycardia is a malignant disease, due to mutations in proteins controlling  Ca(2+) homeostasis. While the phenotype is characterized by polymorphic  ventricular arrhythmias under stress, supraventricular arrhythmias may occur and  are not fully characterized. METHODS: Twenty-five relatives from a Spanish family with several sudden deaths  were evaluated with electrocardiogram, exercise testing, and optional  epinephrine challenge. Selective RyR2 sequencing in an affected individual and  cascade screening in the rest of the family was offered. The RyR2(R420Q)  mutation was generated in HEK-293 cells using site-directed mutagenesis to  conduct in vitro functional studies. RESULTS: The exercise testing unmasked catecholaminergic polymorphic ventricular  tachycardia in 8 relatives (sensitivity\xa0=\xa089%; positive predictive value\xa0=\xa0100%;  negative predictive value\xa0=\xa093%), all of them carrying the heterozygous  RyR2(R420Q) mutation, which was also present in the proband and a young girl  without exercise testing, a 91% penetrance at the end of the follow-up.  Remarkably, sinus bradycardia, atrial and junctional arrhythmias, and/or giant  post-effort U-waves were identified in patients. Upon permeabilization and in  intact cells, the RyR2(R420Q) expressing cells showed a smaller peak of Ca(2+)  release than RyR2 wild-type cells. However, at physiologic intracellular Ca(2+)  concentration, equivalent to the diastolic cytosolic concentration, the  RyR2(R420Q) released more Ca(2+) and oscillated faster than RyR2 wild-type  cells. CONCLUSIONS: The missense RyR2(R420Q) mutation was identified in the N-terminus  of the RyR2 gene in this highly symptomatic family. Remarkably, this mutation is  associated with sinus bradycardia, atrial and junctional arrhythmias, and giant  U-waves. Collectively, functional heterologous expression studies suggest that  the RyR2(R420Q) behaves as an aberrant channel, as a loss- or gain-of-function  mutation depending on cytosolic intracellular Ca(2+) concentration.', 'Cardiac arrhythmias continue to pose a major medical challenge and significant  public health burden. Atrial fibrillation, the most prevalent arrhythmia,  affects more than two million Americans annually and is associated with a  twofold increase in mortality. In addition, more than 250,000 Americans each  year suffer ventricular arrhythmias, often resulting in sudden cardiac death.  Despite the high incidence and societal impact of cardiac arrhythmias, presently  there are insufficient insights into the molecular mechanisms involved in  arrhythmia generation, propagation, and/or maintenance or into the molecular  determinants of disease risk, prognosis, and progression. In addition, present  therapeutic strategies for arrhythmia abatement often are ineffective or require  palliative device therapy after persistent changes in the electrical and  conduction characteristics of the heart have occurred, changes that appear to  increase the risk for arrhythmia progression. This article reviews our present  understanding of the complexity of mechanisms that regulate cardiac membrane  excitability and cardiac function and explores the role of derangements in these  mechanisms that interact to induce arrhythmogenic substrates. Approaches are  recommended for future investigations focused on providing new mechanistic  insights and therapeutic interventions.', 'Atrial fibrillation (AF) is the most prevalent sustained cardiac arrhythmia in  clinical practice associated with significant morbidity and mortality. With the  growing number of the affected individuals, the development of safe and  effective treatment options for AF has become a worldwide priority. Currently  available antiarrhythmic medications for the restoration and maintenance of  sinus rhythm have limitations due to the modest efficacy and a potential for  adverseeffects. Although substantial progress has been made in AF-ablation  techniques, broad application of these nonpharmacological treatment modalities  is limited and antiarrhythmic drug treatment is still the cornerstone and the  first-line therapy for the majority of AF patients. Improvements in the  understanding of the principal pathophysiological mechanisms of AF obtained in  the last several years have provided promising treatment opportunities. New  therapeutic options are based on the more selective targeting of ion channels  and intercellular connection proteins predominantly expressed in the atria, the  restoration of intracellular Ca(2+) homeostasis and the prevention of  AF-associated electrical and structural remodeling. In this review, we provide a  highlight of the most important pathophysiological mechanisms in AF with a  relation to the potential therapeutic interventions, and discuss novel findings  regarding the current and future pharmacological AF management and recent  patents.', 'BACKGROUND: The problem of sudden death in the young is currently debated and  measures for prevention are being evaluated worldwide. Information on the  incidence and causes of sudden (cardiac) death in the young (1-40 years) is  essential for the development of these preventive strategies. METHODS: Incidence estimates and causes of death were determined using death  certificate data of out-of-hospital sudden deaths recorded by Statistics  Netherlands from 1996 to 2006. To define sudden death, International  Classification of Diseases codes were selected based on a systematic review of  the literature assessing the most common causes of sudden death in the young. RESULTS: The incidence of sudden death was 2.07 (2.06-2.07 per 100 000  person-years). The incidence was higher for men (2.86 per 100 000 person-years)  than for women (1.24 per 100 000 person-years) and increased by age. The  majority of sudden deaths was of cardiac origin. Sudden cardiac death incidence  was 1.62 (1.61-1.62 per 100 000 person-years). In 9% the cause of death remained  unexplained. CONCLUSION: The incidence of sudden death in the young is 2.07 per 100 000  person-years. Treatable cardiac causes (such as coronary atherosclerosis and  inherited cardiac diseases) are often underlying for the sudden death. This  information is helpful in the development of preventive strategies.', 'The incidence of sudden cardiac death (SCD) among young athletes is estimated to  be 1-3 per 100,000 person years, and may be underestimated. The risk of SCD in  athletes is higher than in non-athletes because of several factors associated  with sports activity that increase the risk in people with an underlying  cardiovascular abnormality. A clear gender difference in the incidence of SCD  exists in young athletes, with the risk in male athletes being up to 9 times  higher than in female athletes. The most common causes of SCD in young athletes  is underlying inherited/congenital cardiac disease, such as cardiomyopathies,  congenital coronary anomalies and ion channelopathies. Blunt chest trauma also  may cause ventricular fibrillation in a structurally normal heart, known as  commotio cordis. Although geographical differences in the causes of SCD in young  athletes have been reported, these disparities are more likely to be related to  the type and implementation of pre-participation screening leading to the  identification of athletes at risk, rather than reflecting a truly different  ethiology. More studies are needed to clarify the role of ethnicity in the  prevalence of diseases known to cause SCD in young athletes.', ""Atrial fibrillation (AF) is the most common cardiac arrhythmia affecting up to  1-1.5% of the population. Regular physical activity reduces the risk of  cardiovascular diseases, however several studies have shown paradoxically  increased incidence of AF in people practicing sport, especially in elite  athletes. The results of studies suggest a U-shape relationship between sport  and risk of arrhythmia. Minor regular exertion protects from arrhythmia through  reduction in AF risk factors, while intense physical activity increases the risk  of arrhythmia. The etiopathogenesis of arrhythmia in athletes has not been fully  elucidated yet, but it is definitely multifactorial. Arrhythmia's occurrence may  be related to adaptative remodeling of a heart, autonomic nervous system  alteration as well as may be associated with other factors like inflammation or  dyselectrolitaemia. Atrial Fibrillation in athletes should always be considered  as an abnormality which requires further investigation as in small percentage of  cases arrhythmia may be the first manifestation of a structural heart disease or  chanellopathy potentially leading to sudden cardiac death.

What is the inheritance of the glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase (G6PD) deficiency?,"[[['Glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase (G6PD) deficiency is an X-linked recessive  genetic defect that can cause hemolytic crisis. However, this disease affects  both males and females. In Turkey, the frequency of this enzyme deficiency was  reported to vary, from 0.25 to 18%, by the geographical area. Its prevalence in  the northern Black Sea region of Turkey is unknown. The aims of this study were  to assess the prevalence of G6PD deficiency in the northern region Turkey in  children and adults with hyperbilirubinemia and hemolytic anemia. This report  included a total of 976 G6PD enzyme results that were analyzed between May 2005  and January 2014. G6PD deficiency was detected in 5.0% of all patients. G6PD  deficiency was significantly less frequent in females (1.9%, 6/323) than in  males (6.6%, 43/653). G6PD deficiency was detected in 3.7% of infants with  hyperbilirubinemia, 9.2% of children, and 4.5% of adults with hemolytic anemia.  In both the newborn group and the group of children, G6PD deficiency was  significantly more frequent in males. In the combined group of children (groups  I and II), the proportion of males was 74% and 67% in all groups (P = .0008). In  conclusion, in northern region of Turkey, G6PD deficiency is an important cause  of neonatal hyperbilirubinemia and hemolytic crisis in children and adults. This  study suggests that most pediatricians thought that G6PD deficiency is  exclusively a male disease. For this reason, some female patients may have been  undiagnosed.', 'Wallaroos (Macropus robustus robustus), which have the G6PD-F electrophoretic  phenotype, crossed with euros (M.r.erubescens), of G6PD-S phenotype, produced F1  animals which had only the maternal G6PD type regardless of the direction of the  cross. When F1 hybrids were backcrossed to wallaroos or euros, backcross progeny  of either perental phenotype resulted. Sex-linked inheritance of allelic G6PD  genes is shown to occur in wallaroos, euros and red kangaroos (M. rufus). Dose  compensation for X chromosomes at the G6PD locus in kangaroow is achieved by  inactivation of the allele of male parental origin.', 'Mouse chimeras from embryonic stem cells in which the X-linked glucose  6-phosphate dehydrogenase (G6PD) gene had been targeted were crossed with normal  females. First-generation (F(1)) G6PD(+/-) heterozygotes born from this cross  were essentially normal; analysis of their tissues demonstrated strong selection  for cells with the targeted G6PD allele on the inactive X chromosome. When these  F(1) G6PD(+/-) females were bred to normal males, only normal G6PD mice were  born, because: (i) hemizygous G6PD(-) male embryos died by E10.5 and their  development was arrested from E7.5, the time of onset of blood circulation; (ii)  heterozygous G6PD(+/-) females showed abnormalities from E8.5, and died by  E11.5; and (iii) severe pathological changes were present in the placenta of  both G6PD(-) and G6PD(+/-) embryos. Thus, G6PD is not indispensable for early  embryo development; however, severe G6PD deficiency in the extraembryonic  tissues (consequent on selective inactivation of the normal paternal G6PD  allele) impairs the development of the placenta and causes death of the embryo.  Most importantly, G6PD is indispensable for survival when the embryo is exposed  to oxygen through its blood supply.', 'BACKGROUND: Glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase (G6PD) is a metabolic enzyme  involved in the pentose phosphate pathway, its especially important in red blood  cell metabolism. Glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase deficiency is an X-linked  recessive hereditary disease characterised by abnormally low levels of G6PD.  About 400 million people worldwide have a deficiency of this enzyme. The  remarkable geographic correlation of G6PD deficiency distribution with  historical endemicity patterns of malaria has led to suggestions that the two  could be linked. Some studies have concluded that G6PD deficiency confers  resistance to malaria. OBJECTIVE: To determine the prevalence of G6PD deficiency, and determine its  relationship with prevalence and incidence of P. falciparum infection among  children in Uganda. METHODS: This was longitudinal study involving 245 children, 135 were actively  followed up for 12 months. G6PD status was assessed for using PCR-RFLP method. A  thick smear was done to determine presence of plasmodium trophozoites and  parasite densities. RESULTS: A total of 245 children between 6 months and 9 years were recruited. Of  these 46.5% were males. Overall prevalence for the X-linked G6PD A- mutation  was; 79.59% wild type, 12.65% heterozygous and 7.76% homozygous or hemizygous.  Among the males 14% were hemizygous. At baseline, 40.8% had asymptomatic P  falciparum infection. There was no statistically significant difference in  prevalence and incidence rates of malaria infection among the different G6PD  genotypes with prevalence among heterozygous, homozygous, and wild type being  29%, 42.6% and 43% respectively (p\u2009=\u20090.11) and incidence among heterozygous and  wild type being 0.56 and 0.52 episodes/year (p\u2009=\u20090.5). The heterozygous G6PD A-  females had a lower parasite density compared to the wild type (2505 vs 941  parasites/μL; P\u2009=\u20090.024). CONCLUSIONS: This study showed that 20.41% of the population in this part of  Uganda carry the G6PD A-mutation, within the range of 15-32% seen in other parts  of Africa. P. falciparum infection incidence and prevalence rates are similar  among the G6PD genotypes though, once infected, P. falciparum parasite densities  are lowest among G6PD A- heterozygous females. This suggests differences in P.  falciparum infection rates and severity of disease could be mediated by  differences in parasite densities among the different G6PD genotypes.', 'Glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase (G6PD) deficiency is the most frequent enzyme  deficiency. It is a sex-linked genetic disease concerning mostly african,  mediterranean and far-eastern populations. The main clinical expression is a  hemolytic anemia which can be acute or chronic. During the neonatal period the  disease may manifest as neonatal jaundice. We have been asked by the neonate  department to set up a blood screening test for this deficiency. We have  therefore developed a test using umbilical cord blood. The assay of G6PD has  been automatised and red blood cell aspartate-amino-transferase (ASAT) chosen as  a reference enzyme to evaluate the age of red blood cells. Normal values of  G6PD, ASAT and G6PD/ASAT ratio have been calculated from 235 cord samples.  Genetic frequency of this deficiency in 2002 was 6% in male and 1% in female  newborns.', 'Glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase (G6PD) deficiency is the most common human  enzyme defect. In this study, we aimed to perform a molecular investigation of  G6PD deficiency in Tunisia and to associate clinical manifestations and the  degree of deficiency with the genotype. A total of 161 Tunisian subjects of both  sexes were screened by spectrophotometric assay for enzyme activity. Out of  these, 54 unrelated subjects were selected for screening of the most frequent  mutations in Tunisia by PCR/RFLP, followed by size-based separation of  double-stranded fragments under non-denaturing conditions on a denaturing high  performance liquid chromatography system. Of the 56 altered chromosomes  examined, 75\xa0% had the GdA(-) mutation, 14.28\xa0% showed the GdB(-) mutation and  no mutations were identified in 10.72\xa0% of cases. Hemizygous males with GdA(-)  mutation were mostly of class III, while those with GdB(-) mutation were mainly  of class II. The principal clinical manifestation encountered was favism. Acute  hemolytic crises induced by drugs or infections and neonatal jaundice were also  noted. Less severe clinical features such as low back pain were present in  heterozygous females and in one homozygous female. Asymptomatic individuals were  in majority heterozygote females and strangely one hemizygous male. The spectrum  of mutations seems to be homogeneous and similar to that of Mediterranean  countries; nevertheless 10.72\xa0% of cases remain with undetermined mutation thus  suggesting a potential heterogeneity of the deficiency at the molecular level.  On the other hand, we note a better association of the molecular defects with  the severity of the deficiency than with clinical manifestations.', 'After having described in detail the pathophysiology, symptomatology,  X-chromosomal inheritance and some laboratory methods in detecting  G-6-PD-deficiency by demonstrating a case of favism (Schulz et al. 1977), the  authors now discuss the particularities of the enzyme deficiency in the newborn.  These are complicated by additional physiological and transient deficiency of  the enzymes catalase, NAD-diaphorase, glutathione peroxidase, and glucuronyl  transferase. Several chemical substances, acidosis, hypoxia, hypoglycemia, and  immaturity may cause a severe hyperbilirubinemia in G-6-PD-deficient newborns.  The development of a kern-icterus in these cases may be prevented by early  exchange transfusion. From clinical findings and some observations in different  regions of Greece an additional factor influencing the liver function has been  postulated which favors the development of hyperbilirubinemias in  G-6-PD-deficient newborns. The nature of this possible factor is discussed. The  authors emphasize the necessity of screening for G-6-PD-deficiency during  pregnancy in families of mediterranian descent.', 'Glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase (G6PD) deficiency is the commonest red cell  enzymopathy in humans and has an X-linked inheritance. It has been reported from  India more than 30 years ago and the prevalence varies from 0-27% in different  caste, ethnic and linguistic groups. The major clinical manifestations are drug  induced hemolytic anemia, neonatal jaundice and chronic non-spherocytic  hemolytic anemia. Individuals with G6PD deficiency have a selective advantage  against falciparum malaria. Thirteen biochemically characterized variants have  been reported from India. At the molecular level, G6PD Mediterranean is the most  common deficient variant in the caste groups whereas, G6PD Orissa is more  prevalent among the tribal of India. The third common variant seen in India is  G6PD Kerala-Kalyan.', 'We review here some recent data about Glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase (G6PD),  the housekeeping X-linked gene encoding the first enzyme of the pentose  phosphate pathway (PPP), a NADPH-producing dehydrogenase. This enzyme has been  popular among clinicians, biochemists, geneticists and molecular biologists  because it is the most common form of red blood cell enzymopathy. G6PD deficient  erythrocytes do not generate NADPH in any other way than through the PPP and for  this reason they are more susceptible than any other cells to oxidative damage.  Moreover, this enzyme has also been of crucial importance in many significant  discoveries; indeed, G6PD polymorphisms have been instrumental in studying  X-inactivation in the human species, as well as in establishing the clonal  nature of certain tumors. G6PD deficiency, generally considered as a mild and  benign condition, is significantly disadvantageous in certain environmental  conditions like in presence of certain drugs. Nevertheless, G6PD deficiency has  been positively selected by malaria, and recent knowledge seems to show that it  also confers an advantage against the development of cancer, reduces the risk of  coronary diseases and has a beneficial effect in terms of longevity.', ""The aims of this study were to determine the prevalence of glucose-6-phosphate  dehydrogenase (G6PD) deficiency in the United Arab Emirates (UAE), to describe  the different mutations in the population, to determine its prevalence, and to  study inheritance patterns in families of G6PD-deficient individuals. All  infants born at Tawam Hospital, Al-Ain, UAE from January 1994 to September 1996  were screened at birth for their G6PD status. In addition, those attending  well-baby clinics during the period were also screened for the disorder.  Families of 40 known G6PD-deficient individuals, selected randomly from the  records of three hospitals in the country, were assessed for G6PD deficiency.  Where appropriate, this was followed by definition of G6PD mutations. Of 8198  infants, 746 (9.1%), comprising 15% of males and 5% of females tested, were  found to be G6PD deficient. A total of 27 families were further assessed: of  these, all but one family had the nt563 Mediterranean mutation. In one family,  two individuals had the nt202 African mutation. The high manifestation of G6PD  deficiency in women may be due to the preferential expression of the  G6PD-deficient gene and X-inactivation of the normal gene, and/or to the  presence of an 'enhancer' gene that makes the expression of the G6PD deficiency  more likely. The high level of consanguinity which, theoretically, should result  in a high proportion of homozygotes and consequently a higher proportion of  females with the deficiency, was not found to be a significant factor.""]]]","Glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase (G6PD) deficiency follows an X-linked recessive inheritance pattern. This means it is typically passed from mother to son, as the gene is located on the X chromosome. Females have two X chromosomes, so they are carriers if they inherit one defective gene from their mother, but usually do not show symptoms since they have another normal X chromosome. Males have one X and one Y chromosome, so if they inherit the defective gene from their mother, they will develop the condition.","[{'Exact': array([ 8.72441467, -2.90791551,  1.46724594,  5.84921426,  2.37836056,

What organ is associated with a Gleason pattern or Gleason Score?,"[[['BACKGROUND: To compare histological feature of prostate cancer (PCa) according  androgenic status in patients who underwent radical prostatectomy (RP). METHODS: Between March 2007 and September 2013, we prospectively analysed 937  patients who were referred to our centre for RP. Clinical, pathological and  biological data have been prospectively collected. Preoperative total  testosterone (TT) and bioavailable testosterone (BT) serum determinations were  carried out. The threshold for low serum testosterone was set at TT<3 ng/ml.  Preoperative PSA value was registered. Gleason score (GS) and predominant  Gleason pattern were determined in prostate biopsies and in prostate tissue  specimens, crosschecked by two uro-pathologists. RESULTS: Nine hundred and thirty-seven consecutive patients were included. In  all, 14.9% patients had low TT in the population. An exact match between biopsy  and prostate specimens in GS grading was observed for 50.6% patients (n=474).  Also, 40.9% of all patients were upgraded (n=383): 45.3% (n=63) in low serum  testosterone patients and 40.1% (n=320) in normal serum testosterone patients.  For prostate specimens, the proportion of patients with predominant Gleason  pattern 4 was higher in patients with low TT compared with normal TT (41.7% vs  29.1%, P=0.0029). In all, 20.1% were upgraded from predominant Gleason pattern 3  on biopsies specimen to predominant Gleason 4 pattern on the prostate specimen  in patients with low TT, whereas 11.6% were upgraded for normal TT patients  (P=0.002). CONCLUSIONS: Low serum testosterone is an independent risk factor for  predominant Gleason pattern 4 on prostate specimen after RP and for upgrading  from low- to high-grade cancer between prostate needle biopsies and RP specimen.  This observation should be taken into account in localised PCa management,  especially for active surveillance or when a nerve-sparing approach is  considered.', ""BACKGROUND: Research on early life exposures and testicular germ cell tumors  (TGCT) risk has focused on a possible perinatal etiology with a well-known  hypothesis suggesting that hormonal involvement during fetal life is associated  with risk. Second-to-fourth digit ratio (2D:4D) and left-hand dominance have  been proposed as markers of prenatal hormone exposure. AIM: To evaluate associations between 2D:4D digit ratio, right minus left 2D:4D  (ΔR-L), and left-hand dominance and TGCT in the U.S. Servicemen's Testicular  Tumor Environmental and Endocrine Determinants Study. METHODS: A total of 246 TGCT cases and 236 non-testicular cancer controls  participated in the current study, and completed a self-administered  questionnaire. Associations between digit ratio, hand dominance and TGCT were  estimated using unconditional logistic regression adjusting for identified  covariates. RESULTS: Right 2D:4D was not associated with TGCT [odds ratio (OR) for a  one-standard deviation (SD) increase in right-hand 2D:4D: 1.12, 95% confidence  interval (CI): 0.93-1.34]. The results were consistent when evaluating the  association based on the left hand. The difference between right and left-hand  2D:4D was also not associated with TGCT risk [OR for a one-SD increase in ΔR-L:  1.03, 95% CI: 0.87-1.23]. Compared to men who reported right-hand dominance,  ambidexterity [OR (95% CI)=0.65 (0.30-1.41)] and left-hand dominance [OR (95%  CI)=0.79 (0.44-1.44)] were not associated with risk. CONCLUSIONS: These results do not support the hypothesis that prenatal hormonal  imbalance is associated with TGCT risk. Given the limited sample size, further  evaluation of the relationship between TGCT and prenatal hormonal factors using  digit ratio, ΔR-L, or left-hand dominance and larger sample size are warranted."", 'BACKGROUND: The ratio of the second to the fourth digit (2D:4D ratio) is a  sexually dimorphic trait established in utero that differs between ethnic  groups. It is associated with prenatal androgen exposure, and studies have  evaluated the ratio as a marker for certain traits and disease states known to  be associated with higher levels of in utero androgens, such as prostate cancer.  There are currently no screening tools that stratify men with prostate cancer  according to the severity of their disease. This study aims to investigate the  2D:4D ratio as a potential marker for prostate cancer severity. Our hypothesis  was that lower digit ratios, representing higher in utero androgen exposure,  would be associated with more severe disease. METHODS: Measurements were taken of the second and fourth digits of the right  hand of male patients diagnosed with prostate cancer. Gleason score, presence of  metastasis, family history, age at diagnosis and race were recorded. The  distribution of demographic and other patient characteristics were compared with  digit ratios to determine relationships. RESULTS: African-American men with prostate cancer are 3.70 times more likely to  have a low 2D:4D digit ratio than Caucasian men with prostate cancer (95%  confidence interval: 1.98, 6.92; P < 0.0001). There were no statistically  significant differences in the presence of metastasis, Gleason score, family  history or age at diagnosis by digit ratio. CONCLUSION: 2D:4D ratio shows strong differences between African-Americans and  Caucasians; however, it does not correlate with disease severity in men already  diagnosed with prostate cancer. Although this is a small population sample with  possible confounding factors, it does not provide evidence to support the  hypothesis that prenatal androgens affect prostate cancer grade or progression.', 'Patients with Gleason score 7 prostate cancer on radical prostatectomy  demonstrate a wide range in clinical outcome. Gleason grade 4 prostate cancer  encompasses a heterogeneous group of tumor growth patterns including fused,  ill-defined, cribriform, and glomeruloid glandular structures. Our objective was  to determine the prognostic value of different Gleason grade 4 growth patterns.  We performed a nested case-control study among 535 patients with Gleason score 7  prostate cancer at radical prostatectomy, treated between March 1985 and July  2013 at a university hospital in the Netherlands. We analyzed 52 cases (with  metastasis, disease-specific mortality or both) and 109 controls, matched for  age, PSA level, and pT stage. Presence of the following Gleason grade 4 patterns  was recorded: fused, ill-defined, cribriform, and glomeruloid. Intraductal  carcinoma of the prostate and tertiary Gleason grade 5 were additionally  assessed. Outcomes were metastasis-free survival and disease-specific survival.  We used Cox proportional hazards regression to determine the predictive value of  Gleason grade 4 patterns for survival time. The overall prevalence of Gleason  grade 4 patterns was as follows: fused 75% (n=121), ill-defined 64% (n=102),  cribriform 48% (n=83), and glomeruloid 25% (n=40). Cribriform pattern was the  only pattern with an unequal distribution between cases and controls. Forty-two  out of 52 cases (81%) had cribriform growth pattern versus 41/109 controls  (38%). In multivariate analysis, presence of cribriform growth was an adverse  independent predictor for distant metastasis-free survival (HR 8.0, 95% CI  3.0-21; P<0.001) and disease-specific survival (HR 5.4, 95% CI 2.0-15, P=0.001).  In conclusion, cribriform growth in Gleason grade 4 is a strong prognostic  marker for distant metastasis and disease-specific death in patients with  Gleason score 7 prostate cancer at radical prostatectomy.', ""Mulibrey nanism (MUL) is a monogenic disorder with prenatal-onset growth  failure, typical clinical characteristics, cardiopathy and tendency for a  metabolic syndrome. It is caused by recessive mutations in the TRIM37 gene  encoding for the peroxisomal TRIM37 protein with ubiquitin-ligase activity. In  this work, the frequency and pathology of malignant and benign tumours were  analysed in a national cohort of 89 Finnish MUL patients aged 0.7-76 years. The  subjects had a clinical and radiological evaluation, and histological and  immunohistocemical analyses on specimens obtained from biopsy, surgery or  autopsy, were performed. The results show that the MUL patients have disturbed  architecture with ectopic tissues and a high frequency of both benign and  malignant tumours detectable in several internal organs. A total of 210 tumorous  lesions were detected in 66/89 patients (74%). Fifteen malignancies occurred in  13 patients (15%), seven of them in the kidney (five Wilms' tumours), three in  the thyroid gland, two gynaecological cancers, one gastrointestinal carcinoid  tumour, one neuropituitary Langerhans cell histiocytosis and one case of acute  lymphoblastic leukaemia (ALL). Tumours detected by radiology in the liver and  other organs mainly comprised strongly dilated blood vessels (peliosis),  vascularized cysts and nodular lesions. The lesions showed strong expression of  the endothelial cell markers CD34 and CD31 as well as the myocyte marker  alpha-smooth muscle actin (alpha-SMA). Our findings show that MUL is associated  with frequent malignant tumours and benign adenomatous and vascular lesions, as  well as disturbed organ development."", 'OBJECTIVES: Most adenocarcinomas of the prostate with a Gleason score greater  than 8 at radical prostatectomy have extraprostatic extension and a high risk of  progression. With prostate-specific antigen screening, we have seen some cases  of earlier detected, organ-confined, high-grade adenocarcinoma. Few data are  available as to the likelihood of cure in these cases. METHODS: We reviewed 27 cases of pathologically organ-confined adenocarcinoma  with a prostatectomy Gleason score of 8 to 10. To exclude cases with a  significant proportion of Gleason pattern 3, we excluded cases of Gleason score  3+5=8 and Gleason score 5+3=8. All cases of Gleason score 8 at radical  prostatectomy were Gleason score 4+4. The prognostic value of the clinical  parameters (clinical stage, serum prostate-specific antigen level, age) and  pathologic factors (biopsy Gleason score, radical prostatectomy Gleason score,  prostatectomy tumor volume) were tested to predict postoperative progression. RESULTS: The mean age at diagnosis was 59.7 years (range 46 to 69) with  preoperative serum prostate-specific antigen levels ranging from 1.4 to 28 ng/mL  (mean 7.8). All tumors were classified as pathologic Stage T2N0Mx. Fifteen  patients (55.6%) had a Gleason score of 8, 11 patients (40.7%) had a Gleason  score of 9, and 1 had a Gleason score of 10 (3.7%). Tumor volumes ranged from  0.02 to 1.44 cm(3) (mean 0.56). Follow-up information was available for all men.  The mean follow-up for those without progression was 30.6 months (range 7 to 73)  and for those with progression was 23.6 months (range 9 to 44). The 33-month  actuarial risk of progression was 32%, with 10 men developing progression during  the study. None of the preoperative or postoperative variables predicted  progression. CONCLUSIONS: Even when high-grade tumor is organ confined, it is associated with  a relatively unfavorable short-term outcome that is not predictable on the basis  of either preoperative clinicopathologic data or postoperative pathologic  information obtained from the radical prostatectomy specimen.', 'If multiple biopsy cores contain prostate cancer with differing Gleason scores,  should an overall Gleason score be assigned, or should each core be graded  separately? We obtained data on 127 men with prostate cancer on needle biopsy  who underwent subsequent radical prostatectomy at our institution. We compared  the Gleason scores found on needle biopsy with the grade and stage  (organ-confined, extra-prostatic extension, positive seminal vesicles or lymph  nodes) at radical prostatectomy. On biopsy, 40 men had a pure Gleason score of 4  + 3 = 7, 25 men had a Gleason score of 4 + 3 = 7 with a Gleason score of 3 + 3 =  6 on a separate core of the biopsy specimen, 27 men had a pure Gleason score of  4 + 4 = 8, and 35 men had a Gleason score of 4 + 4 = 8 with separate cores  containing Gleason pattern grade 3. A Gleason score of 4 + 4 = 8 with pattern  grade 3 in other cores had a more advanced stage than a pure Gleason score of 4  + 3 = 7 (P = 0.008). There was no clear pattern analyzing pathological stage of  men with a pure Gleason score of 4 + 3 = 7 in comparison with those with Gleason  scores of 4 + 3 = 7 and 3 + 3 = 6 in other cores. The group with a Gleason score  of 4 + 4 = 8 and Gleason pattern grade 3 on other cores had a higher overall  grade on radical prostatectomy than the group with a pure Gleason score of 4 + 3  = 7 (P = 0.001). If one had assigned an overall Gleason score, then a biopsy  with Gleason score 4 + 4 = 8 on 1 or more cores and some pattern grade 3 in  other cores, would be designated as a Gleason score of 4 + 3 = 7. Based on our  findings, patients with a Gleason score of 4 + 4 = 8 on one or more cores with  pattern grade 3 in other cores should be given a final Gleason score of 4 + 4 =  8 instead of 4 + 3 = 7, because these patients are more likely to have higher  stage and grade on radical prostatectomy, comparable to a pure Gleason score of  4 + 4 = 8. Each core should be assigned a separate Gleason score, especially in  cases with high Gleason score cancer on at least 1 core.', ""Glioma risk has consistently been inversely associated with allergy history but  not with smoking history despite putative biologic plausibility. Data from 855  high-grade glioma cases and 1,160 controls from 4 geographic regions of the  United States during 1997-2008 were analyzed for interactions between allergy  and smoking histories and inherited variants in 5 established glioma risk  regions: 5p15.3 (TERT), 8q24.21 (CCDC26/MLZE), 9p21.3 (CDKN2B), 11q23.3  (PHLDB1/DDX6), and 20q13.3 (RTEL1). The inverse relation between allergy and  glioma was stronger among those who did not (odds ratio(allergy-glioma) = 0.40,  95% confidence interval: 0.28, 0.58) versus those who did (odds  ratio(allergy-glioma) = 0.76, 95% confidence interval: 0.59, 0.97;  P(interaction) = 0.02) carry the 9p21.3 risk allele. However, the inverse  association with allergy was stronger among those who carried (odds  ratio(allergy-glioma) = 0.44, 95% confidence interval: 0.29, 0.68) versus those  who did not carry (odds ratio(allergy-glioma) = 0.68, 95% confidence interval:  0.54, 0.86) the 20q13.3 glioma risk allele, but this interaction was not  statistically significant (P = 0.14). No relation was observed between glioma  risk and smoking (odds ratio = 0.92, 95% confidence interval: 0.77, 1.10; P =  0.37), and there were no interactions for glioma risk of smoking history with  any of the risk alleles. The authors' observations are consistent with a recent  report that the inherited glioma risk variants in chromosome regions 9p21.3 and  20q13.3 may modify the inverse association of allergy and glioma."", 'Reelin is a glycoprotein that plays a critical role in the regulation of  neuronal migration during brain development and, since reelin has a role in the  control of cell migration, it might represents an important factor in cancer  pathology. In this study, 66 surgical specimens of prostate cancer were analyzed  for reelin expression by immunohistochemical method. The reelin expression was  correlated with Gleason score and individual Gleason patterns. Reelin expression  was found in 39% prostate cancers. Stromal tissues, normal epithelial cells and  prostate intraepithelial neoplasia (PIN) of any grade around and distant from  cancer were always negative for reelin. Reelin was found in malignant prostatic  epithelial glands of 50% cases Gleason score 10, 52% Gleason score 9, 56%  Gleason score 8, 18% Gleason score 7, while no sample of prostate cancers with  Gleason score 6 showed reelin expression (P=0,005). As reelin staining is  frequently found in high Gleason score prostate cancers, we explored whether  reelin expression is influenced by single Gleason patterns. While Gleason 3  pattern did not show reelin immunoreactivity, reelin expression was found in 35%  Gleason 4 patterns and 45% Gleason 5 patterns (P<0.001). Our results  demonstrated for the first time that reelin is expressed in prostate cancer and  not in benign prostate tissue and its expression occurs in higher Gleason score  and correlates significantly with increasing of single Gleason patterns. This  suggests reelin may behave as a specific histological marker and may represent a  useful biomarker to predict aggressive phenotypic behavior of prostatic cancer  cells.', 'We report the postmortem findings of two siblings with gross and microscopic  features consistent with IMAGe association (Intrauterine growth retardation,  Metaphyseal dysplasia, Adrenal hypoplasia congenita, and Genital anomalies) with  an emphasis on the histopathology of the adrenal gland in this rare syndrome.  The first sibling was an 8-week old male diagnosed postnatally with primary  adrenal insufficiency. There was no deletion of the DAX1 gene by FISH.  Examination at autopsy revealed dysmorphic features including frontal bossing,  epicanthal folds, flat philtrum, cryptorchidism, penile chordee, overriding  fourth toe, and height and weight below 3rd percentile. Grossly, the adrenal  glands were not identified; however, microscopic examination of the suprarenal  soft tissue revealed a 3 mm focus of disorganized fetal adrenal cortex with  distended ""cytomegalic"" cells with abundant pink eosinophilic cytoplasm,  vesicular nuclei, and cytoplasmic vacuolization. A minute focus of permanent  adult cortex was also seen, but no adrenal medulla was identified. An autopsy of  the sibling, who died 12 years previously at day 9 of life, revealed dysmorphic  facial features with cryptorchidism and a large phallus. The adrenal glands were  grossly hypoplastic (11 mm). Histologically, the adrenal glands showed  disorganized fetal cortex with cytomegalic cells, a larger amount of permanent  adult cortex, and bizarre nuclei with numerous pseudoinclusions. While there is  currently limited information regarding the histopathologic adrenal findings in  IMAGe association, our small case series suggests overlapping features between  X-linked recessive congenital adrenal hypoplasia (cytomegalic cells with lack of  permanent adult cortex) and autosomal recessive congenital adrenal hypoplasia  (diminished permanent adult cortex without cytomegalic cells).']]]","The organ associated with Gleason pattern or Gleason Score is the prostate.

What is the treatment of choice  for gastric lymphoma?,"[[['BACKGROUND & AIMS: Appropriate management of primary gastric lymphoma is  controversial. This prospective, multicenter study aimed to evaluate the  accuracy of endoscopic biopsy diagnosis and clinical staging procedures and  assess a treatment strategy based on Helicobacter pylori status and tumor stage  and grade. METHODS: Of 266 patients with primary gastric B-cell lymphoma, 236 with stages  EI (n = 151) or EII (n = 85) were included in an intention-to-treat analysis.  Patients with H. pylori-positive stage EI low-grade lymphoma underwent  eradication therapy. Nonresponders and patients with stage EII low-grade  lymphoma underwent gastric surgery. Depending on the residual tumor status and  predefined risk factors, patients received either radiotherapy or no further  treatment. Patients with high-grade lymphoma underwent surgery and chemotherapy  at stages EI/EII, complemented by radiation in case of incomplete resection. RESULTS: Endoscopic-bioptic typing and grading and clinical staging were  accurate to 73% and 70%, respectively, based on the histopathology of resected  specimens. The overall 2-year survival rates for low-grade lymphoma did not  differ in the risk-adjusted treatment groups, ranging from 89% to 96%. In  high-grade lymphoma, patients with complete resection or microscopic tumor  residuals had significantly better survival rates (88% for EI and 83% for EII)  than those with macroscopic tumor residues (53%; P < 0.001). CONCLUSIONS: There is a considerable need for improvement in clinical diagnostic  and staging procedures, especially with a view toward nonsurgical treatment.  With the exception of eradication therapy in H. pylori-positive low-grade  lymphoma of stage EI and the subgroup of locally advanced high-grade lymphoma,  resection remains the treatment of choice. However, because there is an  increasing trend toward stomach-conserving therapy, a randomized trial comparing  cure of disease and quality of life with surgical and conservative treatment is  needed.', 'Clinicopathologic information of gastrointestinal (GI) lymphoma in Southeast  Asia is lacking. A retrospective analysis of 120 cases of GI lymphoma in  Thailand diagnosed at Siriraj Hospital based on WHO classification was  performed. All were non-Hodgkin lymphoma (NHL). The peak age was in the sixth  and seventh decades; a slight male preponderance was observed. Sites of  involvement included stomach (49.2%), intestine (46.7%), and multiple sites  (4.2%). There were 104 cases of primary GI lymphoma (86.7%) and 16 cases of  secondary GI lymphoma (13.3%). Presenting GI symptoms were more common in the  former; while superficial lymphadenopathy and fever were more common in the  latter. Mass lesions were observed in both groups (72.1% vs 56.3%). Localized  and advanced diseases were found in 68.3% and 31.7% of primary GI lymphomas,  respectively. The most common type of lymphoma in both groups was diffuse large  B-cell lymphoma. Lymphoepithelial lesions (LEL) were not significantly different  between the two groups (58.2% vs 42.9%), but Helicobacterpylori infection was  significantly associated with primary gastric lymphoma (p < 0.0001). The  treatment of choice for localized primary GI lymphoma is controversial. Complete  surgical resection may increase the chance of complete remission, but mortality  and relapse rates might be higher than those observed with combination  chemotherapy alone. GI lymphomas in Thailand are mostly primary B-cell NHL. LEL  is not indicative of primary GI lymphoma, but H. pylori infection is closely  associated with primary gastric lymphoma. A prospective study to determine the  treatment of choice for localized GI lymphoma is needed.', 'OBJECTIVE: We began a controlled clinical trial to assess efficacy and toxicity  of surgery (S), surgery + radiotherapy (SRT), surgery + chemotherapy (SCT), and  chemotherapy (CT) in the treatment of primary gastric diffuse large cell  lymphoma in early stages: IE and II1. SUMMARY BACKGROUND DATA: Management of primary gastric lymphoma remains  controversial. No controlled clinical trials have evaluated the different  therapeutic schedules, and prognostic factors have not been identified in a  uniform population. PATIENTS AND METHODS: Five hundred eighty-nine patients were randomized to be  treated with S (148 patients), SR (138 patients), SCT (153 patients), and CT  (150 patients). Radiotherapy was delivered at doses of 40 Gy; chemotherapy was  CHOP (cyclophosphamide, doxorubicin, vincristine, and prednisone) at standard  doses. International Prognostic Index (IPI) and modified IPI (MIPI) were  assessed to determine outcome. RESULTS: Complete response rates were similar in the 4 arms. Actuarial curves at  10 years of event-free survival (EFS) were as follows: S: 28% (95% confidence  interval [CI], 22% to 41%); SRT: 23% (95% CI, 16% to 29%); that were  statistically significant when compared with SCT: 82% (95% CI, 73% to 89%); and  CT: 92% (95% CI, 84% to 99%) (P < 0.001). Actuarial curves at 10 years showed  that overall survivals (OS) were as follows: S: 54% (95% CI, 46% to 64%); SRT:  53% (95% CI, 45% to 68%); that were statistically significant to SCT: 91% (95%  CI, 85% to 99%); CT: 96% (95% CI, 90% to 103%)(P < 0.001). Late toxicity was  more frequent and severe in patients who undergoing surgery. IPI and MIPI were  not useful in determining outcome and multivariate analysis failed to identify  other prognostic factors. CONCLUSION: In patients with primary gastric diffuse large cell lymphoma and  aggressive histology, diffuse large cell lymphoma in early stage SCT achieved  good results, but surgery was associated with some cases of lethal  complications. Thus it appears that CT should be considered the treatment of  choice in this patient setting. Current clinical classifications of risk are not  useful in defining treatment.', ""Fluoropyrimidines form the mainstay in treatment of gastrointestinal  malignancies.

Currently it is usually given in a combination with leucovorin and oxaliplatin,  i.e. FOLFOX, or irinotecan, i.e. FOLFIRI, or all three, i.e. FOLFIRINOX, but  gradually it has been replaced by oral fluoropyrimidine prodrug formulations,  such as tegafur-uracil and S-1 (both contain ftorafur), and capecitabine  (Xeloda®). Novel drugs such as the antivascular endothelial growth factor  antibody, bevacizumab, and the anti-epidermal growth factor receptor antibody,  cetuximab, are often combined with one of these treatment options. However, when  resistance emerged, no alternatives were available. TAS-102, a combination of  trifluorothymidine and the thymidine phosphorylase inhibitor TPI in a 1:0.5  ratio, is a novel oral formulation, which is active in 5FU-resistant models,  both in vitro and in xenograft models. In addition to inhibition of thymidylate  synthase, the major mechanism of action of classical fluoropyrimidines,  TAS-102's major mechanism of action is incorporation into DNA, thereby causing  DNA damage. TAS-102 also follows an alternative activation pathway via thymidine  kinase, and is not a substrate for dihydropyrimidine dehydrogenase. All together  this explains the efficacy in 5FU-resistant models. In early clinical studies,  the twice-daily schedule (5 days on, 2 days rest) for 2 weeks every 4 weeks, led  to a significant disease control rate in various malignancies. This schedule  showed consistent activity in two randomized trials on fluoropyrimidine  refractory colorectal cancer patients, reflected by an increase of 2-3 months in  overall survival in the TAS-102 group compared with placebo. Considering the  impressive preclinical potential of various combinations TAS-102 has the promise  to become an alternative for 5FU-resistant cancer."", 'TAGS trial revealed the efficacy and safety of  trifluridine/tipiracil(Lonsurf®)treatment in patients with metastatic gastric  cancer following gastrectomy. Here, we successfully treated 38 months survival  case after recurrences following radical gastrectomy for advanced adenocarcinoma  of esophago-gastric junction using historical recommended chemotherapy regimens  and trifluridine/tipiracil as a fifth-line chemotherapy. Trifluridine/tipiracil  therapy contributed to effective and safety treatment even in late-line  chemotherapy for recurrent gastric cancer.', 'BACKGROUND: Trastuzumab deruxtecan (DS-8201a) is a novel HER2-targeted  antibody-drug conjugate with a humanised anti-HER2 antibody, cleavable  peptide-based linker, and topoisomerase I inhibitor payload. A phase 1,  non-randomised, open-label, multiple-dose study was done to assess the safety,  tolerability, and activity of trastuzumab deruxtecan in HER2-expressing advanced  solid tumours. The dose escalation (part 1) has previously been reported and the  recommended doses for expansion of 5·4 mg/kg or 6·4 mg/kg were established. In  this Article, we report the safety and preliminary activity results from this  phase 1 trial in all patients with HER2-positive gastric or gastro-oesophageal  junction cancer who received trastuzumab deruxtecan at the recommended doses for  expansion. METHODS: This was an open-label, dose-escalation and dose-expansion phase 1  trial done at eight hospitals and clinics in the USA and six in Japan. Eligible  patients were at least 18 years old in the USA and at least 20 years old in  Japan and had advanced solid tumours (regardless of HER2 expression in dose  escalation or HER2 expression or mutation in dose expansion). The recommended  doses for expansion of 5·4 mg/kg or 6·4 mg/kg trastuzumab deruxtecan were  administered intravenously to patients once every 3 weeks until withdrawal of  consent, unacceptable toxicity, or progressive disease. In this Article, all  patients with HER2-positive gastric or gastro-oesophageal junction cancer with  previous trastuzumab treatment who received trastuzumab deruxtecan were analysed  together. The primary endpoints of the study were safety and preliminary  activity (proportion of patients who achieved an objective response as assessed  by the investigators). The activity evaluable set included all patients who  received at least one dose of trastuzumab deruxtecan at the recommended doses  for expansion, and for whom both baseline and post-treatment activity data were  available. The safety analysis set included all patients who received at least  one dose of trastuzumab deruxtecan at the recommended doses for expansion.  Enrolment for patients with gastric or gastro-oesophageal junction cancer has  completed. This trial is registered at ClinicalTrials.gov, number NCT02564900,  and ClinicalTrials.jp, number JapicCTI-152978. FINDINGS: Between Aug 28, 2015, and Aug 10, 2018, 44 patients with HER2-positive  gastric or gastro-oesophageal junction cancer received at least one dose of  trastuzumab deruxtecan at the recommended doses for expansion. All patients had  at least one treatment-emergent adverse event. The most frequent grade 3 or  worse treatment-emergent adverse events included anaemia (13 [30%]) and  decreases in neutrophil (nine [20%]), platelet (eight [18%]), and white blood  cell (seven [16%]) counts. Serious treatment-emergent adverse events occurred in  11 (25%) patients. There were four pneumonitis cases (three grade 2 and one  grade 3). There were no drug-related deaths due to treatment-emergent adverse  events. 19 (43·2%; 95% CI 28·3-59·0) of 44 patients had a confirmed objective  response. INTERPRETATION: Trastuzumab deruxtecan had a manageable safety profile and  showed preliminary activity in heavily pretreated patients with HER2-positive  gastric or gastro-oesophageal junction cancer. These results support further  investigation of trastuzumab deruxtecan for HER2-positive gastric or  gastro-oesophageal junction cancer post-trastuzumab. FUNDING: Daiichi Sankyo Co, Ltd.', ""OBJECTIVE: To present our experience with the treatment of primary  gastrointestinal (GI) non-Hodgkin's lymphoma, evaluate prognostic factors, and  give our recommendations for treatment. DESIGN: Retrospective study. SETTING: Teaching hospital, Spain. SUBJECTS: 76 patients (47 men and 29 women, mean age 51 years) treated over the  15 years 1980-1994. INTERVENTIONS: 52 patients had radical resections, 19 palliative resections, and  5 biopsy alone. 42 (55%) also had adjuvant chemotherapy and 20 (26%)  radiotherapy. RESULTS: Patients with primary intestinal lymphoma were slightly but not  significantly younger than those with gastric lymphoma (43 compared with 56  years). 43 Patients (57%) had tumours in the stomach, 26 (34%) in the small  bowel, and 7 (9%) in the colon. At presentation 34 had stage I disease, 25 stage  IIE1 disease, and the remaining 17 stage IIE2; 14 were classified as low grade,  41 as intermediate, and 21 as high grade. 60 (79%) had a B-cell phenotype.  Overall 5-year survival was 53%. Of the 11 variables tested by univariate  analysis for their prognostic effect only abdominal mass (p < 0.001), clinical  stage (p < 0.001), type of operation (p < 0.001), tumour size (p < 0.05), and  histological grade (p < 0.05) achieved significance, but when Cox's multivariate  analysis was applied only clinical stage was significant (p < 0.01). CONCLUSION: Operation is the treatment of choice, but chemotherapy and  radiotherapy may have a role though as yet there are no standard guidelines for  their use."", 'The treatment of primary gastric lymphoma is controversial. The role of surgery  has come to be questioned with increasing knowledge about the pathogenesis of  gastric lymphoma and with new therapeutic approaches such as eradication of  Helicobacter pylori. We review published clinical trials of primary gastric  lymphoma, including preliminary results of our own prospective multicenter  trial. The results of 7 trials of H. pylori eradication and 12 prospective  therapeutic trials trial are discussed. On basis of these data it is concluded  that surgery with intention of R0 resection is the treatment of choice in stages  EI2 and EII1 of low-grade lymphoma. In high-grade lymphomas it is still unclear  whether surgery or its primary combination with radio- or chemotherapy should be  preferred. The eradication of H. pylori is a promising therapeutic approach for  localized low-grade mucosa-associated lymphoid tissue lymphoma. A randomized  trial is needed to clarify whether medical or surgical management of localized  gastric lymphoma or a combination of two is the best treatment modality.', 'BACKGROUND: Rilotumumab is a fully human monoclonal antibody that selectively  targets the ligand of the MET receptor, hepatocyte growth factor (HGF). We aimed  to assess the efficacy, safety, and pharmacokinetics of rilotumumab combined  with epirubicin, cisplatin, and capecitabine, and to assess potential  biomarkers, in patients with advanced MET-positive gastric or gastro-oesophageal  junction adenocarcinoma. METHODS: This multicentre, randomised, double-blind, placebo-controlled, phase 3  study was done at 152 centres in 27 countries. We recruited adults (aged ≥18  years) with unresectable locally advanced or metastatic gastric or  gastro-oesophageal junction adenocarcinoma, an Eastern Cooperative Oncology  Group (ECOG) performance status of 0 or 1, MET-positive tumours (≥25% of tumour  cells with membrane staining of ≥1+ staining intensity), and evaluable disease,  who had not received previous systemic therapy. Eligible patients were randomly  assigned (1:1) via a computerised voice response system to receive rilotumumab  15 mg/kg intravenously or placebo in combination with open-label chemotherapy  (epirubicin 50 mg/m2 intravenously; cisplatin 60 mg/m2 intravenously;  capecitabine 625 mg/m2 orally twice daily) in 21-day cycles for up to ten  cycles. After completion of chemotherapy, patients continued to receive  rilotumumab or placebo monotherapy until disease progression, intolerability,  withdrawal of consent, or study termination. Randomisation was stratified by  disease extent and ECOG performance status. Both patients and physicians were  masked to study treatment assignment. The primary endpoint was overall survival,  analysed by intention to treat. We report the final analysis. This study is  registered with ClinicalTrials.gov, number NCT01697072. FINDINGS: Between Nov 7, 2012, and Nov 21, 2014, 609 patients were randomly  assigned to rilotumumab plus epirubicin, cisplatin, and capecitabine  (rilotumumab group; n=304) or placebo plus epirubicin, cisplatin, and  capecitabine (placebo group; n=305). Study treatment was stopped early after an  independent data monitoring committee found a higher number of deaths in the  rilotumumab group than in the placebo group; all patients in the rilotumumab  group subsequently discontinued all study treatment. Median follow-up was 7·7  months (IQR 3·6-12·0) for patients in the rilotumumab group and 9·4 months  (5·3-13·1) for patients in the placebo group. Median overall survival was 8·8  months (95% CI 7·7-10·2) in the rilotumumab group compared with 10·7 months  (9·6-12·4) in the placebo group (stratified hazard ratio 1·34, 95% CI 1·10-1·63;  p=0·003). The most common grade 3 or worse adverse events in the rilotumumab and  placebo groups were neutropenia (86 [29%] of 298 patients vs 97 [32%] of 299  patients), anaemia (37 [12%] vs 43 [14%]), and fatigue (30 [10%] vs 35 [12%]).  The frequency of serious adverse events was similar in the rilotumumab and  placebo groups (142 [48%] vs 149 [50%]). More deaths due to adverse events  occurred in the rilotumumab group than the placebo group (42 [14%] vs 31 [10%]).  In the rilotumumab group, 33 (11%) of 298 patients had fatal adverse events due  to disease progression, and nine (3%) had fatal events not due to disease  progression. In the placebo group, 23 (8%) of 299 patients had fatal adverse  events due to disease progression, and eight (3%) had fatal events not due to  disease progression. INTERPRETATION: Ligand-blocking inhibition of the MET pathway with rilotumumab  is not effective in improving clinical outcomes in patients with MET-positive  gastric or gastro-oesophageal adenocarcinoma. FUNDING: Amgen.', 'BACKGROUND: The phase II YO28252 study (NCT01590719) examined first-line  onartuzumab plus mFOLFOX6 in patients with metastatic, human epidermal growth  factor receptor 2-negative adenocarcinoma of the stomach or gastroesophageal  junction. MET immunohistochemistry expression as a biomarker of onartuzumab  activity was also examined. PATIENTS AND METHODS: Patients were randomized 1:1 to receive standard mFOLFOX6  plus onartuzumab (10 mg/kg) or placebo in 2-week cycles for 12 cycles, followed  by onartuzumab or placebo until disease progression. Coprimary endpoints were  progression-free survival (PFS) in intent-to-treat (ITT) and MET-positive  populations. The target hazard ratio (HR) was 0.70 for patients in the ITT group  and 0.60 in the MET-positive population. Secondary endpoints were overall  survival (OS), overall response rate (ORR), and safety. RESULTS: Overall, 123 patients were enrolled (n = 62 onartuzumab, n = 61  placebo). Median PFS was 6.77 versus 6.97 months for onartuzumab versus placebo,  respectively (HR, 1.08; 95% confidence interval [CI], 0.71-1.63; p = .71). In  the MET-positive population, median PFS was 5.95 versus 6.80 months, onartuzumab  versus placebo (HR, 1.38; 95% CI, 0.60-3.20; p = .45). Median OS was 10.61  months for onartuzumab versus 11.27 months for placebo) (HR, 1.06, 0.64-1.75; p  = .83). In the MET-positive population, median OS was 8.51 versus 8.48 months  for onartuzumab versus placebo, respectively (HR, 1.12, 95% CI, 0.45-2.78; p =  .80). ORR was 60.5% for the onartuzumab group and 57.1% for placebo. Grade 3-5  adverse events (AEs) were seen in 88.3% of patients receiving onartuzumab and in  78.3% of patients receiving placebo, with serious AEs in 55% and 40%,  respectively. CONCLUSION: The addition of onartuzumab to mFOLFOX6 in gastric cancer did not  improve efficacy in an unselected population or in a MET  immunohistochemistry-positive population. IMPLICATIONS FOR PRACTICE: The YO28252 study demonstrated that the addition of  the anti-MET agent onartuzumab to mFOLFOX6 for treatment of gastric cancer did  not improve efficacy in an overall study population or those selected for  positive MET status by immunohistochemistry. This highlights the importance of  correctly selecting biomarkers for targeted therapies. A multivariate analysis  suggested that MET positivity may still be prognostic for worse median overall  survival in gastric cancer; therefore, it is important to continue investigation  into the optimal approach to inhibit MET signaling in gastric cancer.']]]","The treatment of choice for gastric lymphoma depends on the stage and grade of the disease.

What is herceptin?,"[[['Overexpression of erbB2 in breast tumors is associated with poor prognosis and  is a target of receptor-oriented cancer therapy. Trastuzumab (Herceptin), a  monoclonal antibody against a membrane-proximal epitope in the extracellular  region of erbB2, shows a therapeutic effect against a fraction of  erbB2-amplified breast tumors. Unfortunately, resistance to Herceptin is common,  and its cause is as yet unclear. Here we investigated the properties of erbB2 in  a Herceptin-resistant cell line, JIMT-1, established from a breast cancer  patient showing erbB2 gene amplification and primary resistance to Herceptin.  The expression profile of erbB proteins, Herceptin-induced erbB2  internalization, and down-regulation in JIMT-1 were similar to those in  Herceptin-sensitive lines. However, the mean number of Herceptin Mab binding  sites in JIMT-1 was 1/5 that of the expressed erbB2 molecules, although 5% to  10% of the cells showed a approximately 10-fold higher Herceptin binding than  the main population. Herceptin Fab and Mab 2C4, an antibody binding to an  epitope in the ectodomain further removed from the membrane, bound more  efficiently to JIMT-1 cells than Herceptin Mab, implying that erbB2 was partly  masked. The expression of MUC4, a membrane-associated mucin that according to  reports contributes to the masking of membrane proteins, was higher in JIMT-1  than in Herceptin-sensitive lines, and its level was inversely correlated with  the Herceptin binding capacity of single cells. Knockdown of MUC4 expression by  RNA interference increased the binding of Herceptin. Western blotting showed a  low level of proteolytic processing, shedding, and tyrosine phosphorylation of  erbB2 in JIMT-1. The latter finding may explain its Herceptin-resistant  phenotype characterizing both the low and high Herceptin binding subpopulations.  We conclude that masking of erbB2 in JIMT-1 leads to diminished Herceptin  binding and isolation of erbB2 from its normal interaction and activation  partners.', 'Her2 (erbB2/neu) is overexpressed in 25-30% of human breast cancers. Herceptin  is a recombinant humanized Her2 antibody used to treat breast cancer patients  with Her2 overexpression. Over a 5-month selection process, we isolated clones  of BT474 (BT) human breast carcinoma cells (BT/Her(R)) that were resistant to  Herceptin in vitro. In BT/Her(R) subclones, cell-surface, phosphorylated and  total cellular Her2 protein remained high in the continuous presence of  Herceptin. Likewise, the levels of cell-surface, phosphorylated, and total  cellular Her3 and EGFR were either unchanged or only slightly elevated in  BT/Her(R) subclones relative to BT cells. One BT/Her(R) subclone had  substantially upregulated cell-surface EGFR, but this did not correlate with a  higher relative resistance to Herceptin. In looking at the downstream PI-3K/Akt  signaling pathway, phosphorylated and total Akt levels and Akt kinase activities  were all sustained in BT/Her(R) subclones in the presence of Herceptin, but  significantly downregulated in BT cells exposed to Herceptin. Whereas BT cells  lost sensitivity to the PI-3K inhibitor LY294002 in the presence of Herceptin,  BT/Her(R) subclones were equally sensitive to this agent in the presence and  absence of Herceptin. This suggests that BT/Her(R) subclones acquired a  Herceptin-resistant mechanism of PI-3K signaling. BT/Her(R) subclones were also  sensitive to the EGFR kinase inhibitor AG1478 in the presence of Herceptin, to  the same extent as BT cells. The BT/Her(R) subclones provide new insights into  mechanisms of Herceptin resistance and suggest new treatment strategies in  combination with other inhibitors targeted to signal transduction pathways.', 'PURPOSE: Herceptin is widely used in treating Her2-overexpressing breast cancer.  However, the application of Herceptin in prostate cancer is still controversial.  Our previous results have indicated the relevance of Her2 in the transition of  the androgen requirement in prostate cancer cells. In this study, the effects of  radioimmunotherapy against Her2 in prostate cancer were investigated. MATERIALS AND METHODS: DU145, an androgen receptor-negative prostate cancer cell  line, was used in vitro and in vivo to evaluate the effects of Herceptin labeled  with a beta emitter, Rhenium-188 (Re-188). Its effects on cell growth, extent of  apoptosis, the bio-distribution of Re-188 labeled Herceptin (Re-H), and protein  levels were determined. RESULTS: Treatments with Re-188 and Re-H reduced the proliferation of DU145  cells in dose- and time-dependent manners compared to the Herceptin-treated  group. Growth inhibition and apoptosis were induced after Re-H treatment; growth  inhibition was more distinct in cells with high Her2/p-Her2 levels. Our in vivo  xenograft studies revealed that Re-H treatment significantly retarded tumor  growth and altered the levels of apoptosis-related proteins. The  bio-distribution of Re-H in mice demonstrated a tissue-specific pattern.  Importantly, the levels of p35 protein, which is related to cancer cell survival  and invasion, dramatically decreased after Re-H treatment. CONCLUSIONS: Our data demonstrate that Re-188-labeled Herceptin effectively  inhibited the growth of DU145 cells compared to the Herceptin- and  Re-188-treated cohorts. This implies that targeting Her2 by both radio- and  immuno- therapy might be a potential strategy for treating patients with  androgen-independent prostate cancer.', 'Clinical use of Herceptin (trastuzumab), which is a humanized monoclonal  antibody against HER2, started for patients with HER2-overexpressing breast  cancer. To potentiate the efficacy of the Herceptin therapy, this study focused  on the combination of Herceptin with activated immune lymphocytes. We used  peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) as effector cells and used  HER2-unexpressing K562 cells, HER2-weakly-expressing breast carcinoma cells  (Breast-M), or HER2-strongly-expressing breast carcinoma cells (BT-474) as  target cells. Interleukin-2 (IL-2)-activated PBMCs, IL-2/OKT-3-activated PBMCs  and a streptococcal preparation OK-432-activated PBMCs were generated and used  as effector cells. Cytotoxic activity was determined with 4-hour 51Cr release  assay. Both fresh PBMCs and activated PBMCs exhibited Herceptin-dependent  cytotoxicity. Importantly, Herceptin-dependent cytotoxicity was found even at a  lower effector to target cell ratio (E/T ratio) than that of  Herceptin-independent cytotoxicity. In addition, Herceptin-dependent  cytotoxicity by these activated PBMCs was observed even in  HER2-weakly-expressing Breast-M cells. Since gamma-globulin or anti-CD16  antibody abrogated Herceptin-dependent cytotoxicity, it seems likely that  antibody-dependent cellular cytotoxicity (ADCC) plays an important role in the  Herceptin-dependent cytotoxicity. We present a recurrent breast cancer patient  with malignant pleural effusion, in which HER2-strongly-expressing tumor cells  were present, who was undergoing Herceptin therapy. Cluster formation between  tumor cells and intrapleural mononuclear cells was induced 24 hours after  intravenous injection of Herceptin (4 mg/kg). Mononuclear cells bound  specifically to HER2-strongly-expressing tumor cells but not to other cells,  such as mesothelial cells, suggested a Herceptin-mediated binding like ADCC in  vivo. Taken together, these findings suggest that the combination of Herceptin  with various types of activated lymphocytes may be a new therapeutic strategy,  not only for HER2-strongly-expressing breast cancer but also for  HER2-weakly-expressing cancer.', 'Herceptin (trastuzumab), an anti-HER2 monoclonal antibody, is the first  oncogene-targeted therapy to be developed for the treatment of metastatic breast  cancer. The Herceptin clinical trial program has demonstrated that treatment  with Herceptin provides substantial clinical benefits when used either as  monotherapy or in combination with a number of chemotherapeutic agents. Of note,  accurate assessment of HER2 status is essential to ensure that the patients most  likely to benefit from Herceptin are identified: patients with  immunohistochemistry (IHC) 3+ or fluorescence in-situ hybridization  (FISH)-positive disease gain the greatest clinical benefits. In addition,  clinical benefits appear to be greater the earlier Herceptin is used, although  there is currently no direct clinical evidence to indicate whether an initial  strategy of combination therapy is better than monotherapy or vice versa.  Herceptin has been shown to be generally well tolerated. The most severe adverse  events are rare serious infusion-related reactions and cardiotoxicity. These  adverse events can be managed by standard care and patients at risk can often be  identified prior to the initiation of Herceptin treatment. Currently, Herceptin  should be given until disease progression, but there could be benefit in  continuing treatment beyond disease progression.', 'Overexpression of erbB2 in breast tumors is associated with poor prognosis and  is a target of receptor-oriented cancer therapy. Trastuzumab (Herceptin), a  monoclonal antibody against a membrane-proximal epitope in the extracellular  region of erbB2, shows a therapeutic effect against a fraction of  erbB2-amplified breast tumors. Unfortunately, resistance to Herceptin is common,  and its cause is as yet unclear. Here we investigated the properties of erbB2 in  a Herceptin-resistant cell line, JIMT-1, established from a breast cancer  patient showing erbB2 gene amplification and primary resistance to Herceptin.  The expression profile of erbB proteins, Herceptin-induced erbB2  internalization, and down-regulation in JIMT-1 were similar to those in  Herceptin-sensitive lines. However, the mean number of Herceptin Mab binding  sites in JIMT-1 was 1/5 that of the expressed erbB2 molecules, although 5% to  10% of the cells showed a approximately 10-fold higher Herceptin binding than  the main population. Herceptin Fab and Mab 2C4, an antibody binding to an  epitope in the ectodomain further removed from the membrane, bound more  efficiently to JIMT-1 cells than Herceptin Mab, implying that erbB2 was partly  masked. The expression of MUC4, a membrane-associated mucin that according to  reports contributes to the masking of membrane proteins, was higher in JIMT-1  than in Herceptin-sensitive lines, and its level was inversely correlated with  the Herceptin binding capacity of single cells. Knockdown of MUC4 expression by  RNA interference increased the binding of Herceptin. Western blotting showed a  low level of proteolytic processing, shedding, and tyrosine phosphorylation of  erbB2 in JIMT-1. The latter finding may explain its Herceptin-resistant  phenotype characterizing both the low and high Herceptin binding subpopulations.  We conclude that masking of erbB2 in JIMT-1 leads to diminished Herceptin  binding and isolation of erbB2 from its normal interaction and activation  partners.', 'BACKGROUND: Herceptin is a humanized antibody that binds to the product of the  HER-2 oncogene. Clinical studies have indicated that treatment with Herceptin  may slow disease progression in tumors expressing high levels of the HER-2  antigen. However, the mechanism of this action is not known. METHODS: Four different cell lines were used that had different levels of HER-2  expression. Treated and nontreated cells were analyzed for DNA strand breaks and  cell cycle perturbation using standard flow cytometry methods. RESULTS: In this study we found that cell lines expressing high levels of HER-2,  when treated with Herceptin, exhibited marked increases in DNA strand breaks as  measured by the TUNEL assay, and that these cells also exhibited slowed growth.  BT-474 and SKBR-3 cell lines, both of which express high levels of the HER-2  antigen, had significant increases in labeled nucleotide expression at 3 and 6  day time points following exposure to Herceptin at a concentration of 10  microg/ml. Similar treatment of MCF-7 and MDA-231 cell lines, both of which  express low levels of HER-2, had little effect on the level of labeled  nucleotide expression at either the 3 or 6 day time points. Following 4 days of  Herceptin treatment, BT-474 and SKBR-3 cell lines had significant decreases in  the percentage of cells in the S phase of growth. This effect was not seen in  either the MCF-7 or MDA-231 cell lines. CONCLUSION: Herceptin has a biological effect only on cells that contain high  levels of HER-2. This effect is a decrease in cell proliferation that is  coincident with, and may be caused by an increase frequency of DNA strand  breaks.', ""Herceptin/Trastuzumab is a humanized IgG1κ light chain antibody used to treat  some forms of breast cancer. A phage-displayed recombinant antibody library was  used to obtain a single chain fragment variable (scFv, designated 2B4) to a  linear synthetic peptide representing Herceptin's heavy chain CDR3. Enzyme  linked immunosorbent assays (ELISAs) and piezoimmunosensor/quartz crystal  microbalance (QCM) assays were used to characterize 2B4-binding activity to both  native and heat denatured Herceptin. The 2B4 scFv specifically bound to heat  denatured Herceptin in a concentration dependent manner over a wide (35-220.5  nM) dynamic range. Herceptin denatures and forms significant amounts of  aggregates when heated. UV-vis characterization confirms that Herceptin forms  aggregates as the temperature used to heat Herceptin increases. QCM affinity  assay shows that binding stoichiometry between 2B4 scFv and Herceptin follows a  1:2 relationship proving that 2B4 scFv binds strongly to the dimers of heat  denatured Herceptin aggregates and exhibits an affinity constant of 7.17 ×  10(13) M(-2). The 2B4-based QCM assay was more sensitive than the corresponding  ELISA. Combining QCM with ELISA can be used to more fully characterize  nonspecific binding events in assays. The potential theoretical and clinical  implications of these results and the advantages of the use of QCM to  characterize human therapeutic antibodies in samples are also discussed."", 'Breast cancer (BCa) is the most common cancer affecting women worldwide.  Overexpression of human epidermal growth factor receptor 2 (HER2) occurs in  ~20-25% of invasive ductal breast carcinomas and is associated with the more  aggressive phenotype. Herceptin, a humanized antibody against HER2, is a  standard therapy in HER2-overexpressing cases. Approximately one-third of  patients relapse despite treatment. Therefore numerous studies have investigated  the molecular mechanisms associated with Herceptin resistance. An interaction  between HER2 signalling and steroid hormone receptor signalling pathways has  been previously investigated, but the effect of this relationship on Herceptin  resistance has never been studied. The present study analysed an impact of the  steroid hormone, progesterone (PG), on Herceptin-dependent cell growth  inhibition. Results indicated that Herceptin-inhibited proliferation of breast  cancer cell lines overexpressing HER2 (BT474 and MCF/HER2) in 3D culture is  abolished by PG. Furthermore, results demonstrated that PG led to the activation  of HER2/HER3-mediated signalling. Moreover, PG treatment induced a shift of  Herceptin-dependent cell cycle arrest in G1 phase towards S and G2 phases with  concomitant upregulation of cyclin-dependent kinase 2 (CDK2) and downregulation  of CDK inhibitor p27Kip1. These results demonstrate for the first time PG  involvement in the failure of Herceptin treatment in vitro. The present  observations suggest that cross-talk between PG- and HRG/HER2-initiated  signalling pathways may lead to the acquisition of resistance to Herceptin in  patients with BCa.', 'Gastric cancer remains one of the most malignant human cancers with poor  prognosis. Herceptin is a well-received antibody drug for HER2 positive gastric  cancer. Primary Herceptin resistance and acquired Herceptin resistance retarded  the use of Herceptin for gastric cancer. We herein reported CMIP (C-Maf-inducing  protein) was overexpressed in Herceptin-resistant gastric cancer cells MKN45-HR  and NCI-N87-HR; CMIP promoted Herceptin resistance of HER2 positive gastric  cancer cells. SOX2 was examined to be positively regulated by CMIP and also  promoted Herceptin resistance of HER2 positive gastric cancer cells. SOX2 might  mediate the Herceptin resistance promoting role of CMIP in gastric cancer cells.  Elevated expression of CMIP was associated with poor clinicopathological  features including tumor size, lymph node metastasis and clinical stage in HER2  positive gastric cancer patients. Inhibitors of CMIP could be used as potential  adjuvant therapeutic drugs for HER2 positive gastric cancer.']]]","Herceptin, formally known as trastuzumab, is a humanized monoclonal antibody designed to target and bind to the HER2 protein, which is overexpressed in about 25-30% of human breast cancers. It works by blocking the HER2 protein's ability to activate cell growth signals, thereby inhibiting the growth of cancer cells. Initially approved for use in treating HER2-overexpressing breast cancer, Herceptin has shown therapeutic effects in some breast tumors but faces challenges with resistance developing in many cases. Research continues to explore mechanisms of resistance and potential new treatment strategies, including combinations with other therapies.","[{'Exact': array([22.47200852, 35.85907317,  2.85335264,  7.08209427, -4.72749321,

What symptoms characterize the Muenke syndrome?,"[[['OBJECTIVE: To investigate executive function and adaptive behavior in  individuals with Muenke syndrome using validated instruments with a normative  population and unaffected siblings as controls. STUDY DESIGN: Participants in this cross-sectional study included individuals  with Muenke syndrome (P250R mutation in FGFR3) and their mutation-negative  siblings. Participants completed validated assessments of executive functioning  (Behavior Rating Inventory of Executive Function [BRIEF]) and adaptive behavior  skills (Adaptive Behavior Assessment System, Second Edition [ABAS-II]). RESULTS: Forty-four with a positive FGFR3 mutation, median age 9 years, range 7  months to 52 years were enrolled. In addition, 10 unaffected siblings served as  controls (5 males, 5 females; median age, 13 years; range, 3-18 years). For the  General Executive Composite scale of the BRIEF, 32.1% of the cohort had scores  greater than +1.5 SD, signifying potential clinical significance. For the  General Adaptive Composite of the ABAS-II, 28.2% of affected individuals scored  in the 3rd-8th percentile of the normative population, and 56.4% were below the  average category (<25th percentile). Multiple regression analysis did not  identify craniosynostosis as a predictor of BRIEF (P = .70) or ABAS-II scores (P  = .70). In the sibling pair analysis, affected siblings performed significantly  poorer on the BRIEF General Executive Composite and the ABAS-II General Adaptive  Composite. CONCLUSION: Individuals with Muenke syndrome are at an increased risk for  developing adaptive and executive function behavioral changes compared with a  normative population and unaffected siblings.', 'PURPOSE: The Muenke syndrome mutation (FGFR3 (P250R)), which was discovered 15  years ago, represents the single most common craniosynostosis mutation. Muenke  syndrome is characterized by coronal suture synostosis, midface hypoplasia,  subtle limb anomalies, and hearing loss. However, the spectrum of clinical  presentation continues to expand. To better understand the pathophysiology of  the Muenke syndrome, we present collective findings from several recent studies  that have characterized a genetically equivalent mouse model for Muenke syndrome  (FgfR3 (P244R)) and compare them with human phenotypes. CONCLUSIONS: FgfR3 (P244R) mutant mice show premature fusion of facial sutures,  premaxillary and/or zygomatic sutures, but rarely the coronal suture. The mice  also lack the typical limb phenotype. On the other hand, the mutant mice display  maxillary retrusion in association with a shortening of the anterior cranial  base and a premature closure of intersphenoidal and spheno-occipital  synchondroses, resembling human midface hypoplasia. In addition, sensorineural  hearing loss is detected in all FgfR3 (P244R) mutant mice as in the majority of  Muenke syndrome patients. It is caused by a defect in the mechanism of cell fate  determination in the organ of Corti. The mice also express phenotypes that have  not been previously described in humans, such as reduced cortical bone  thickness, hypoplastic trabecular bone, and defective temporomandibular joint  structure. Therefore, the FgfR3 (P244R) mouse provides an excellent opportunity  to study disease mechanisms of some classical phenotypes of Muenke syndrome and  to test novel therapeutic strategies. The mouse model can also be further  explored to discover previously unreported yet potentially significant  phenotypes of Muenke syndrome.', 'BACKGROUND: Muenke syndrome is a genetically determined craniosynostosis that  involves one or both coronal sutures. In some patients it is associated with  skeletal abnormalities such as thimble-like middle phalanges, coned epiphysis,  and/or neurological impairment, namely sensorineural hearing loss or mental  retardation. In spite of a variable phenotype, Muenke syndrome has been related  to a unique mutation on the FGFR3 gene, Pro 250 to Arg, which is characteristic  of this disease. Because of the incomplete penetrance of this anomaly, the  suspicion of Muenke syndrome must be raised in any child with uni- or bilateral  coronal craniosynostosis, and the genetic analysis propounded even in the  absence of extracranial features. ILLUSTRATIVE CASES: We report the cases of two sisters who presented with Muenke  syndrome and whose affected mother did not have any form of craniosynostosis.', 'Muenke syndrome caused by the FGFR3 Pro250Arg mutation is associated with  craniosynostosis, hearing loss, and various bony anomalies. Although this  mutation is involved in bone growth and development, bony tumors are rare in  this condition. We describe a patient with a molecular diagnosis of Muenke  syndrome who also presented with multiple osteochondromas of the upper and lower  extremities. This association has only been described once before in a patient  with an isolated osteochondroma of the proximal tibia. Altered expression of  FGFR3, an important mediator of chondrocyte proliferation and differentiation  during in the growth plates of long bones, may help to explain the development  of osteochondromatous lesions in this patient.', ""The Muenke syndrome (MS) is characterized by unicoronal or bicoronal  craniosynostosis, midfacial hypoplasia, ocular hypertelorism, and a variety of  minor abnormalities associated with a mutation in the fibroblast growth factor  receptor 3 (FGFR3) gene. The birth prevalence is approximately one in 10,000  live births, accounting for 8-10% of patients with coronal synostosis. Although  MS is a relatively common diagnosis in patients with craniosynostosis syndromes,  with autosomal dominant inheritance, there has been no report of MS, in an  affected Korean family with typical cephalo-facial morphology that has been  confirmed by molecular studies. Here, we report a familial case of MS in a  female patient with a Pro250Arg mutation in exon 7 (IgII-IGIII linker domain) of  the FGFR3 gene. This patient had mild midfacial hypoplasia, hypertelorism,  downslanting palpebral fissures, a beak shaped nose, plagio-brachycephaly, and  mild neurodevelopmental delay. The same mutation was confirmed in the patient's  mother, two of the mother's sisters and the maternal grandfather. The severity  of the cephalo-facial anomalies was variable among these family members."", 'Muenke syndrome is characterized by various craniofacial deformities and is  caused by an autosomal-dominant activating mutation in fibroblast growth factor  receptor 3 (FGFR3(P250R) ). Here, using mice carrying a corresponding mutation  (FgfR3(P244R) ), we determined whether the mutation affects temporomandibular  joint (TMJ) development and growth. In situ hybridization showed that FgfR3 was  expressed in condylar chondroprogenitors and maturing chondrocytes that also  expressed the Indian hedgehog (Ihh) receptor and transcriptional target Patched  1(Ptch1). In FgfR3(P244R) mutants, the condyles displayed reduced levels of Ihh  expression, H4C-positive proliferating chondroprogenitors, and collagen type II-  and type X-expressing chondrocytes. Primary bone spongiosa formation was also  disturbed and was accompanied by increased osteoclastic activity and reduced  trabecular bone formation. Treatment of wild-type condylar explants with  recombinant FGF2/FGF9 decreased Ptch1 and PTHrP expression in  superficial/polymorphic layers and proliferation in chondroprogenitors. We also  observed early degenerative changes of condylar articular cartilage, abnormal  development of the articular eminence/glenoid fossa in the TMJ, and fusion of  the articular disc. Analysis of our data indicates that the activating  FgfR3(P244R) mutation disturbs TMJ developmental processes, likely by reducing  hedgehog signaling and endochondral ossification. We suggest that a balance  between FGF and hedgehog signaling pathways is critical for the integrity of TMJ  development and for the maintenance of cellular organization.', 'In about 30% of the patients with syndromal craniosynostosis, a genetic mutation  can be traced. For the purpose of adequate genetic counseling and treatment of  these patients, the full spectrum of clinical findings for each specific  mutation needs to be appreciated. The Pro250Arg mutation in the FGFR3 gene is  found in patients with Muenke syndrome and is one of the most frequently  encountered mutations in craniosynostosis syndromes. A number of studies on the  relationship between genotype and phenotype concerning this specific mutation  have been published. Two Dutch families with Muenke syndrome were screened for  the reported characteristics of this syndrome and for additional features. New  phenotypical findings were hypoplasia of the frontal sinus, ptosis of the upper  eyelids, dysplastic elbow joints with restricted elbow motion, and mild  cutaneous syndactyly. Incidentally, polydactyly, severe ankylosis of the elbow,  fusion of cervical vertebrae, and epilepsy were found. Upper eyelid ptosis is  thought to be pathognomonic for Saethre-Chotzen syndrome but was also observed  in our series of patients with Muenke syndrome. Because Muenke and  Saethre-Chotzen syndrome can have similar phenotypes, DNA analysis is needed to  distinguish between these syndromes, even when a syndrome diagnosis is already  made in a family member.', 'Muenke syndrome caused by the FGFR3 Pro250Arg mutation is associated with  craniosynostosis, hearing loss, and various bony anomalies.

Which is the most widely used model for the study of multiple sclerosis (MS)?,"[[['In multiple sclerosis (MS) the structural damage to axons determines the  persistent clinical deficit patients acquire during the course of the disease.  It is therefore important to test therapeutic strategies that can prevent or  reverse this structural damage. The conventional animal model of MS,  experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis (EAE), typically shows disseminated  inflammation in the central nervous system, which leads to a clinical deficit  that cannot be directly attributed to a defined tract system. For this reason we  have developed a localized EAE model, in which large inflammatory lesions are  targeted to the dorsal columns of the spinal cord, an area including the  corticospinal tract. These lesions show the pathological hallmarks of MS plaques  and lead to reproducible and pronounced deficits in hindlimb locomotion. Because  of the anatomical specificity of this technique we can now use highly sensitive  behavioral tests that assess the functional integrity of specific axonal tracts.  We show that these tests are predictive of the site and extent of a given lesion  and are more sensitive for assessing the clinical course than the scales  commonly used for disseminated EAE models. We believe that this targeted EAE  model will become a helpful new tool for the evaluation of therapeutic  approaches for MS that attempt to protect axons or support their repair.', 'Magnetic resonance is the most sensitive para-clinical method available for the  diagnosis of multiple sclerosis since it shows changes in 95% of the patients  with clinically definite multiple sclerosis. However, little correlation has  been found, in different studies, between the parameters of magnetic resonance  and the degree of neurological disability. The development and gradual  application of new techniques of magnetic resonance, which permit specific  detection of the lesions with the greatest degree of nerve dysfunction, permits  improvement in the use of this technique for study of the natural history of the  disease and thus to monitor patients given new treatments.', 'Several single-nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) genome-wide association studies  (GWASs) have been completed in multiple sclerosis (MS). Follow-up studies of the  variants with the most promising rankings, especially when supplemented by  informed candidate gene selection, have proven to be extremely successful. In  this study we report the results of a multi-stage replication analysis of the  putatively associated SNPs identified in the Wellcome Trust Case Control  Consortium non-synonymous SNP (nsSNP) screen. In total, the replication sample  consisted of 3444 patients and 2595 controls. A combined analysis of the nsSNP  screen and replication data provides evidence implicating a novel additional  locus, rs3748816 in membrane metalloendopeptidase-like 1 (MMEL1; odds  ratio=1.16, P=3.54 × 10⁻⁶) in MS susceptibility.', 'Recent years have substantially broadened our view on the pathogenesis of  multiple sclerosis (MS). While earlier concepts focused predominantly on T  lymphocytes as the key cell type to mediate inflammatory damage within central  nervous system (CNS) lesions, emerging evidence suggests that B lymphocytes may  play a comparably important role both as precursors of antibody-secreting plasma  cells and as antigen-presenting cells (APCs) for the activation of T cells. With  greater appreciation of this pathogenic B-cell function in MS, B-cell-directed  therapies, and in particular B-cell-depleting monoclonal antibodies targeting  the CD20 molecule, have gained enormous interest over recent years. Clinical  trials demonstrated that anti-CD20 treatment, which depletes immature and mature  B cells but spares CD20 negative plasma cells, rapidly reduces formation of new  inflammatory CNS lesions. While these findings clearly corroborate a pathogenic  contribution of B cells, recent experimental but also clinical findings indicate  that not all B cells contribute in an equally pathogenic manner and that certain  subsets may in contrast mediate anti-inflammatory effects. In this review, we  summarize current findings in support of pathogenic B-cell function in MS,  including the encouraging clinical data which derived from anti-CD20 MS trials.  Further, we review novel findings suggestive of regulatory properties of B-cell  subsets which may be collaterally abolished by pan-CD20 depletion. In  conclusion, we aim to provide an outlook on how this currently differentiating  concept of pro- and anti-inflammatory B-cell function could be harnessed to  further improve safety and effectiveness of B-cell-directed therapeutic  approaches in MS.', 'Multiple sclerosis is a chronic inflammatory demyelinating disease, associated,  in 50-80% of patients, with persistent pain. While the type of pain that affects  these patients is being more documented, the mechanisms underlying this  pathology are still poorly understood and animal models of such chronic pain  associated with MS are required. The aim of our study was to characterize the  sensory abnormalities and in particular the clinical signs linked to persistent  pain in two models of Experimental Autoimmune Encephalomyelitis (EAE) in the  rat. This behavioural characterization tested several sensory modalities such as  mechanical and thermal (heat/cold) hyperalgesia or allodynia and explored some  of these modalities on two different extremities: the hindpaws and the tail. Our  study showed that while one of the model produced more robust motor impairment,  animals of both models suffer from mechanical hyperalgesia and thermal allodynia  to cold, both at the level of the tail and the hindpaws. While the time-course  changes of some of these modalities are shifted in the time between the two  models, they represent good models of the sensory abnormalities experienced by  MS patients. The second part of our study aimed at characterizing from a  pharmacological point of view the most robust model (""EAE+Cyclosporine"") and  showed that Gabapentin, Duloxetine and Tramadol partially relieved some of the  clinical signs. Our results suggest that the model ""EAE+Cyclosporine"" in the rat  is a good model of chronic sensory abnormalities observed in MS patients both  from a behavioural and pharmacological point of view.', 'We hypothesized that quantitative MS/MS-based proteomics at multiple time  points, incorporating rapid microwave and magnetic (M(2) ) sample preparation,  could enable relative protein expression to be correlated to disease progression  in the experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis (EAE) animal model of multiple  sclerosis. To test our hypothesis, microwave-assisted  reduction/alkylation/digestion of proteins from brain tissue lysates bound to C8  magnetic beads and microwave-assisted isobaric chemical labeling were performed  of released peptides, in 90 s prior to unbiased proteomic analysis. Disease  progression in EAE was assessed by scoring clinical EAE disease severity and  confirmed by histopathologic evaluation for central nervous system inflammation.  Decoding the expression of 283 top-ranked proteins (p <0.05) at each time point  relative to their expression at the peak of disease, from a total of 1191  proteins observed in four technical replicates, revealed a strong statistical  correlation to EAE disease score, particularly for the following four proteins  that closely mirror disease progression: 14-3-3ε (p = 3.4E-6); GPI (p = 2.1E-5);  PLP1 (p = 8.0E-4); PRX1 (p = 1.7E-4). These results were confirmed by Western  blotting, signaling pathway analysis, and hierarchical clustering of EAE risk  groups. While validation in a larger cohort is underway, we conclude that M(2)  proteomics is a rapid method to quantify putative prognostic/predictive protein  biomarkers and therapeutic targets of disease progression in the EAE animal  model of multiple sclerosis.', 'Experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis (EAE) is an animal model for studying  multiple sclerosis (MS). Calpain has been implicated in many inflammatory and  neurodegenerative events that lead to disability in EAE and MS. Thus, treating  EAE animals with calpain inhibitors may block these events and ameliorate  disability. To test this hypothesis, acute EAE Lewis rats were treated dose  dependently with the calpain inhibitor calpeptin (50-250 microg/kg). Calpain  activity, gliosis, loss of myelin, and axonal damage were attenuated by  calpeptin therapy, leading to improved clinical scores. Neuronal and  oligodendrocyte death were also decreased, with down-regulation of proapoptotic  proteins, suggesting that decreases in cell death were due to decreases in the  expression or activity of proapoptotic proteins. These results indicate that  calpain inhibition may offer a novel therapeutic avenue for treating EAE and MS.', 'To assess neurological impairments quantitatively in an animal model of multiple  sclerosis (MS), we have used a targeted model of experimental autoimmune  encephalomyelitis (EAE), which leads to the formation of anatomically defined  lesions in the spinal cord. Deficits in the hindlimb locomotion are therefore  well defined and highly reproducible, in contrast to the situation in  generalized EAE with disseminated lesions. Behavioral tests for hindlimb  sensorimotor functions, originally established for traumatic spinal cord injury,  revealed temporary or persistent deficits in open field locomotion, the grid  walk, the narrow beam and the measurement of the foot exorotation angle. Such  refined behavioral testing in EAE will be crucial for the analysis of new  therapeutic approaches for MS that seek to improve or prevent neurological  impairment.', 'Multiple sclerosis (MS) is believed to be initiated when myelin-specific T cells  infiltrate the central nervous system (CNS), triggering subsequent recruitment  of inflammatory leukocytes to the CNS. The contribution of neutrophils to CNS  autoimmune disease has been underappreciated, but several studies in  experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis (EAE), an animal model of MS, indicate  that neutrophils have an important role in inflammation. Neutrophils are  hypothesized to contribute to the pathogenesis of EAE by producing cytokines and  promoting breakdown of the blood brain barrier. Neutrophils may also influence  the manifestation of EAE by facilitating parenchymal brain inflammation. This  review summarizes evidence supporting a functional role for neutrophils in EAE  and MS, highlighting the differential regulation of neutrophil recruitment in  the brain and spinal cord.', ""The pathogenic events in multiple sclerosis (MS) that result in immune cell  infiltration, multifocal demyelination and axonal loss have been focused by the  strong impact of the classical MS model experimental autoimmune  encephalomyelitis (EAE) towards the hypothesis that MS is an entirely T  cell-mediated disease. Although conspicuous humoral immune responses have been  known since Kabal's seminal finding of elevated immunoglobulins (Igs) in the  cerebrospinal fluid (CSF), only in the past few years evidence derived from  recent studies of the MS lesion of anti-myelin antibodies (Abs) in patients with  early MS and of MS animal models has led to a renewed interest in the role for B  cells, plasma cells and their products in the pathogenesis of MS. This review  surveys the actual data concerning the role of the humoral immune system in MS  and EAE and explains potential modes of action and long-time persistence in the  inflamed brain tissue as a B cell-supportive microenvironment in MS. These  mechanisms include the modulation of antigen presentation and costimulation to T  cells, increased myelin opsonisation und recruitment of inflammatory cells to  the CNS, but also immunoregulatory influences on the remyelination by  anti-myelin B cells and Abs. So, affecting the humoral immune system in MS would  be a reasonable therapeutic option.""]]]",Experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis (EAE) is the most widely used model for the study of multiple sclerosis (MS).,"[{'Exact': array([ 4.83497305, -0.73545503, -0.84357936,  0.37542531, -1.69222126,

How does ranolazine affect calcium handling in the heart,"[[['PURPOSE: Ranolazine is a novel antianginal medication that acts by ameliorating  disturbed sodium and calcium homeostasis. By preventing myocyte sodium and  calcium overload, ranolazine also have potential beneficial effects on  myocardial function. Experimental models support this concept, as do 2 small  studies in human participants receiving ranolazine intravenously. We evaluated  changes in parameters of left ventricular function in stable angina patients  treated with oral ranolazine. METHODS: Twenty-two participants were enrolled with Doppler echocardiography  performed at baseline and a mean of 2 months after initiation of treatment. RESULTS: Global left ventricular function, as assessed by the myocardial  performance index, was significantly improved on drug therapy (P < .0001). This  was due to improvement in both diastolic and systolic parameters. Of 21  patients, 17 reported less angina and 8 patients reported an increase in  activity level. CONCLUSIONS: We report improved parameters of left ventricular function in  response to ranolazine as used in the clinical setting.', 'Pathological conditions linked to imbalances in oxygen supply and demand (for  example, ischaemia, hypoxia and heart failure) are associated with disruptions  in intracellular sodium ([Na(+)](i)) and calcium ([Ca(2+)](i)) concentration  homeostasis of myocardial cells. A decreased efflux or increased influx of  sodium may cause cellular sodium overload. Sodium overload is followed by an  increased influx of calcium through sodium-calcium exchange. Failure to maintain  the homeostasis of [Na(+)](i) and [Ca(2+)](i) leads to electrical instability  (arrhythmias), mechanical dysfunction (reduced contractility and increased  diastolic tension) and mitochondrial dysfunction. These events increase ATP  hydrolysis and decrease ATP formation and, if left uncorrected, they cause cell  injury and death. The relative contributions of various pathways (sodium  channels, exchangers and transporters) to the rise in [Na(+)](i) remain a matter  of debate. Nevertheless, both the sodium-hydrogen exchanger and abnormal sodium  channel conductance (that is, increased late sodium current (I(Na))) are likely  to contribute to the rise in [Na(+)](i). The focus of this review is on the role  of the late (sustained/persistent) I(Na) in the ionic disturbances associated  with ischaemia/hypoxia and heart failure, the consequences of these ionic  disturbances, and the cardioprotective effects of the antianginal and  anti-ischaemic drug ranolazine. Ranolazine selectively inhibits late I(Na),  reduces [Na(+)](i)-dependent calcium overload and attenuates the abnormalities  of ventricular repolarisation and contractility that are associated with  ischaemia/reperfusion and heart failure. Thus, inhibition of late I(Na) can  reduce [Na(+)](i)-dependent calcium overload and its detrimental effects on  myocardial function.', 'BACKGROUND: Despite advances in antithrombotic therapies and invasive  technology, the risk of recurrent ischemic complications in patients with  non-ST-elevation acute coronary syndromes (NSTE-ACSs) remains substantial.  Ranolazine is a novel agent that inhibits the late sodium current thereby  reducing cellular sodium and calcium overload and has been shown to reduce  ischemia in patients with chronic stable angina. STUDY DESIGN: MERLIN-TIMI 36 is a phase III, randomized, double-blind,  parallel-group, placebo-controlled, multinational clinical trial to evaluate the  efficacy and safety of ranolazine during long-term treatment of patients with  NSTE-ACS receiving standard therapy (N = 6500). Eligible patients are randomized  1:1 to ranolazine or matched placebo, initiated as 200 mg intravenously over 1  hour, followed by an 80-mg/h infusion (40 mg/h for patients with severe renal  insufficiency) for up to 96 hours and oral ranolazine ER 1000 mg BID or matched  placebo until the end of study. The primary end point is the time to first  occurrence of any element of the composite of cardiovascular death, myocardial  infarction, or recurrent ischemia. Secondary end points include ischemia on  Holter monitoring, hospitalization for new or worsening heart failure, quality  of life measures, and exercise performance. The evaluation of long-term safety  will include death from any cause and symptomatic documented arrhythmia.  Recruitment began in October 2004. The trial will continue until 730 major  cardiovascular events and 310 deaths are recorded with expected completion in 24  to 28 months. CONCLUSIONS: MERLIN-TIMI 36 will evaluate the role of ranolazine in the acute  and chronic management of patients presenting with NSTE-ACS.', 'BACKGROUND: Timothy syndrome is a multisystem disorder associated with QT  interval prolongation and ventricular cardiac arrhythmias. The syndrome has been  linked to mutations in Ca(V)1.2 resulting in gain of function of the L-type  calcium current (I(Ca,L)). Ranolazine is an antianginal agent shown to exert an  antiarrhythmic effect in experimental models of long QT syndrome. OBJECTIVE: The purpose of this study was to develop and characterize an  experimental model of Timothy syndrome by using BayK8644 to mimic the gain of  function of I(Ca,L) and to examine the effects of ranolazine. METHODS: Action potentials from epicardial and M regions and a  pseudo-electrocardiogram (ECG) were simultaneously recorded from  coronary-perfused left ventricular wedge preparations, before and after addition  of BayK8644 (1 microM). RESULTS: BayK8644 preferentially prolonged action potential duration of the M  cell, leading to prolongation of the QT interval and an increase in transmural  dispersion of repolarization (from 44.3 +/- 7 ms to 86.5 +/- 25 ms). Stimulation  at cycle lengths of 250-500 ms led to ST-T wave alternans due to alternation of  the plateau voltage of the M cell action potential as well as development of  delayed afterdepolarizations in epicardial and M cell action potentials.  Ventricular extrasystoles and tachycardia (monomorphic, bidirectional, or  torsades de pointes) developed spontaneously or after rapid pacing. Peak and  late I(Na) were unaffected by BayK8644. Clinically relevant concentrations of  ranolazine (10 microM) suppressed all actions of BayK8644. CONCLUSION: A left ventricular wedge model of long QT syndrome created by  augmentation of I(Ca,L) recapitulates the ECG and arrhythmic manifestations of  Timothy syndrome, which can be suppressed by ranolazine.', 'BACKGROUND: Despite advances in antithrombotic therapies and invasive  technology, the risk of recurrent ischemic complications in patients with  non-ST-elevation acute coronary syndromes (NSTE-ACSs) remains substantial.  Ranolazine is a novel agent that inhibits the late sodium current thereby  reducing cellular sodium and calcium overload and has been shown to reduce  ischemia in patients with chronic stable angina. STUDY DESIGN: MERLIN-TIMI 36 is a phase III, randomized, double-blind,  parallel-group, placebo-controlled, multinational clinical trial to evaluate the  efficacy and safety of ranolazine during long-term treatment of patients with  NSTE-ACS receiving standard therapy (N = 6500). Eligible patients are randomized  1:1 to ranolazine or matched placebo, initiated as 200 mg intravenously over 1  hour, followed by an 80-mg/h infusion (40 mg/h for patients with severe renal  insufficiency) for up to 96 hours and oral ranolazine ER 1000 mg BID or matched  placebo until the end of study. The primary end point is the time to first  occurrence of any element of the composite of cardiovascular death, myocardial  infarction, or recurrent ischemia. Secondary end points include ischemia on  Holter monitoring, hospitalization for new or worsening heart failure, quality  of life measures, and exercise performance. The evaluation of long-term safety  will include death from any cause and symptomatic documented arrhythmia.  Recruitment began in October 2004. The trial will continue until 730 major  cardiovascular events and 310 deaths are recorded with expected completion in 24  to 28 months. CONCLUSIONS: MERLIN-TIMI 36 will evaluate the role of ranolazine in the acute  and chronic management of patients presenting with NSTE-ACS.', 'Pathological conditions, including ischemia and heart failure, are associated  with altered sodium channel function and increased late sodium current  (I(Na,L)), leading to prolonged action potential duration, increased  intracellular sodium and calcium concentrations, and arrhythmias. We used  anemone toxin (ATX)-II to study the effects of increasing I(Na,L) on  intracellular calcium cycling in rat isolated hearts. Cardiac contraction was  abolished using paralytic agents. Ranolazine (RAN) was used to inhibit late  I(Na). Hearts were loaded with fluo-4-acetoxymethyl ester, and myocyte  intracellular calcium transients (CaTs) were measured using laser scanning  confocal microscopy. ATX (1 nM) prolonged CaT duration at 50% recovery in hearts  paced at a basal rate of 2 Hz and increased the sensitivity of the heart to the  development of calcium alternans caused by fast pacing. ATX increased the time  required for recovery of CaT amplitude following a previous beat, and ATX  induced spontaneous calcium release waves during rapid pacing of the heart. ATX  prolonged the duration of repolarization from the initiation of the activation  to terminal repolarization in the pseudo-electrocardiogram. All actions of ATX  were both reversed and prevented by subsequent or prior exposure, respectively,  of hearts to RAN (10 microM). Most importantly, the increased vulnerability of  the heart to the development of calcium alternans during rapid pacing was  reversed or prevented by 10 microM RAN. These results suggest that enhancement  of I(Na,L) alters calcium cycling. Reduction by RAN of I(Na,L)-induced  dysregulation of calcium cycling could contribute to the antiarrhythmic actions  of this agent in both reentrant and triggered arrhythmias.', 'The effective treatment of coronary artery disease targets two distinct goals,  controlling symptomatic angina and decreasing the adverse events associated with  ischemia. Traditional anti-anginal and anti-ischemic drugs function by altering  the determinants of myocardial oxygen supply or demand, usually by altering  loading conditions, changing the heart rate, or impacting contractility.  Blockade of the late inward sodium current, late I(Na), offers another target  for the treatment of ischemia. Blockade of late I(Na) reduces the sodium and  calcium overload that follows ischemia. This improves myocardial relaxation and  reduces left ventricular diastolic stiffness, in turn enhancing myocardial  contractility and perfusion. Ranolazine, a late I(Na) inhibitor, has been shown  to provide both anti-anginal and anti-ischemic benefits without significant  alterations in the heart rate and blood pressure in patients with stable  coronary artery disease. When evaluated in patients with acute coronary  syndrome, ranolazine has been shown to decrease recurrent ischemia, but not  significantly reduce the risk of death or myocardial infarction. This review  will address the rationale that inhibition of the late sodium current is  beneficial in reducing cardiac dysfunction during ischemia, and discuss the  clinical studies supporting the use of ranolazine for its anti-anginal and  anti-ischemic effects.', 'BACKGROUND: Ranolazine (Ran), an antianginal agent, inhibits late Na(+) current.  The purpose of this study was to determine whether there was an added benefit of  adding Ran to cardioplegia (CP) in a model of global ischemia/reperfusion. METHODS AND RESULTS: Isolated rat hearts were Langendorff-perfused and exposed  to 40-minute normothermic, cardioplegic global ischemia and 30 minutes of  reperfusion. Before ischemia and during reperfusion, hearts were treated with no  drug (control) or with the late Na(+) current inhibitors Ran (5 micromol/L) or  tetrodotoxin (1 micromol/L). Ischemic cardioplegic arrest led to an increase of  left ventricular end-diastolic pressure (LVEDP) by > or =20 mm Hg (ie, cardiac  contracture). Ten out of 11 hearts treated with CP alone developed contracture,  whereas 6 out of 11 hearts treated with CP plus Ran developed contracture. Ran  added to CP reduced LVEDP at the end of ischemia from 41+/-5 mm Hg in CP alone  to 26+/-3 mm Hg in CP plus Ran (P=0.024). Area under the curve for LVEDP during  the entire ischemic period was also smaller in CP plus Ran versus CP alone. The  percent increase (from baseline) of LVEDP measured at the end of 30-minute  reperfusion was smaller for CP plus Ran (66+/-18%) versus CP alone (287+/-90%;  P=0.035). The area under the curve for LVEDP during reperfusion was smaller in  CP plus Ran versus CP alone. Tetrodotoxin (1 micromol/L) also reduced cardiac  contracture during ischemia/reperfusion, compared to CP alone. CONCLUSIONS: Our results suggest that Ran may have therapeutic potential as an  adjunct to CP and further support a protective role of Na(+) current inhibition  during ischemia/reperfusion.', 'BACKGROUND: Ranolazine (Ran) is known to inhibit multiple targets, including the  late Na(+)current, the rapid delayed rectifying K(+)current, the L-type  Ca(2+)current, and fatty acid metabolism. Functionally, Ran suppresses early  afterdepolarization (EADs) and torsades de pointes (TdP) in drug-induced long QT  type 2 (LQT2) presumably by decreasing intracellular [Na(+)](i) and  Ca(2+)overload. However, simulations of EADs in LQT2 failed to predict their  suppression by Ran. OBJECTIVE: To elucidate the mechanism(s) whereby Ran alters cardiac action  potentials (APs) and cytosolic Ca(2+)transients and suppresses EADs and TdP in  LQT2. METHODS: The known effects of Ran were included in simulations (Shannon and  Mahajan models) of rabbit ventricular APs and Ca(2+)transients in control and  LQT2 models and compared with experimental optical mapping data from Langendorff  rabbit hearts treated with E4031 (0.5 μM) to block the rapid delayed rectifying  K(+)current. Direct effects of Ran on cardiac ryanodine receptors (RyR2) were  investigated in single channels and changes in Ca(2+)-dependent high-affinity  ryanodine binding. RESULTS: Ran (10 μM) alone prolonged action potential durations (206 ± 4.6 to  240 ± 7.8 ms; P <0.05); E4031 prolonged action potential durations (204 ± 6 to  546 ± 35 ms; P <0.05) and elicited EADs and TdP that were suppressed by Ran (10  μM; n = 7 of 7 hearts). Simulations (Shannon but not Mahajan model) closely  reproduced experimental data except for EAD suppression by Ran. Ran reduced open  probability (P(o)) of RyR2 (half maximal inhibitory concentration = 10 ± 3 μM; n  = 7) in bilayers and shifted half maximal effective concentration for  Ca(2+)-dependent ryanodine binding from 0.42 ± 0.02 to 0.64 ± 0.02 μM with 30 μM  Ran. CONCLUSIONS: Ran reduces P(o) of RyR2, desensitizes Ca(2+)-dependent RyR2  activation, and inhibits Ca(i) oscillations, which represents a novel mechanism  for its suppression of EADs and TdP.', 'The goal of this study was to test the hypothesis that the novel anti-ischemic  drug ranolazine, which is known to inhibit late I(Na), could reduce  intracellular [Na(+)](i) and diastolic [Ca(2+)](i) overload and improve  diastolic function. Contractile dysfunction in human heart failure (HF) is  associated with increased [Na(+)](i) and elevated diastolic [Ca(2+)](i).  Increased Na(+) influx through voltage-gated Na(+) channels (late I(Na)) has  been suggested to contribute to elevated [Na(+)](i) in HF. In isometrically  contracting ventricular muscle strips from end-stage failing human hearts,  ranolazine (10 micromol/L) did not exert negative inotropic effects on twitch  force amplitude. However, ranolazine significantly reduced frequency-dependent  increase in diastolic tension (i.e., diastolic dysfunction) by approximately 30%  without significantly affecting sarcoplasmic reticulum (SR) Ca(2+) loading. To  investigate the mechanism of action of this beneficial effect of ranolazine on  diastolic tension, Anemonia sulcata toxin II (ATX-II, 40 nmol/L) was used to  increase intracellular Na(+) loading in ventricular rabbit myocytes. ATX-II  caused a significant rise in [Na(+)](i) typically seen in heart failure via  increased late I(Na). In parallel, ATX-II significantly increased diastolic  [Ca(2+)](i). In the presence of ranolazine the increases in late I(Na), as well  as [Na(+)](i) and diastolic [Ca(2+)](i) were significantly blunted at all  stimulation rates without significantly decreasing Ca(2+) transient amplitudes  or SR Ca(2+) content. In summary, ranolazine reduced the frequency-dependent  increase in diastolic tension without having negative inotropic effects on  contractility of muscles from end-stage failing human hearts. Moreover, in  rabbit myocytes the increases in late I(Na), [Na(+)](i) and [Ca(2+)](i) caused  by ATX-II, were significantly blunted by ranolazine. These results suggest that  ranolazine may be of therapeutic benefit in conditions of diastolic dysfunction  due to elevated [Na(+)](i) and diastolic [Ca(2+)](i).']]]","Ranolazine affects calcium handling in the heart by reducing the late sodium current (late I(Na)), which in turn decreases intracellular sodium and calcium overload. This reduction in calcium overload leads to improved diastolic function, specifically reducing the frequency-dependent increase in diastolic tension without negatively affecting contractility. Additionally, ranolazine prevents the increases in late I(Na), intracellular sodium ([Na(+)](i)), and diastolic calcium ([Ca(2+)](i)) caused by Anemonia sulcata toxin II (ATX-II) in ventricular rabbit myocytes.","[{'Exact': array([ -3.79136571,  15.68948909,  -0.54333529,   0.72413686,

Why does cranberry juice help combat urinary tract infections?,"[[['Flavonoids, present in high levels in cranberries, are potent bioactives known  for their health-promoting benefits, but cranberry beverages (CB) are not  typically recommended as part of a healthy diet. We examine the association  between CB consumption with macronutrient intake and weight status. Data for US  adults (≥19 years, n = 10,891) were taken from the National Health and Nutrition  Examination Survey (NHANES) Survey 2005-2008. Total CB consumption was measured  over two non-consecutive 24-h dietary recalls. Linear and logistic regression  models adjusting for important covariates were used to examine predicted  differences between CB consumers and non-consumers on macronutrient and  anthropometric outcomes. Results are weighted to be nationally representative.  CB consumers (n = 581) were older (>50 year) non-Hispanic black females. They  consumed an average 221 mL (7.5 oz) CB per day. In fully adjusted models CB  consumers (vs. non-consumers) had higher carbohydrates and total sugars and  lower percent energy from protein and total fat (all p < 0.001), but no  difference in total energy. A significantly higher proportion of CB consumers  were predicted to be normal weight (BMI < 25 kg/m2; p = 0.001) and had to have  lower waist circumferences (p = 0.001). Although there was not a significant  trend across level of CB intake, low and middle level CB consumers compared to  non-consumers were more likely to be normal weight (p < 0.001) and less likely  to be overweight/obese (BMI ≥ 25 kg/m2, p < 0.001). Despite having slightly  higher daily macronutrient intakes, CB consumers have more desirable  anthropometric measures compared to non-consumers.', 'Cranberry juice cocktail (CJC) has been shown to inhibit the formation of  biofilm by uropathogenic Escherichia coli. In order to investigate whether the  anti-adhesive components could reach the urinary tract after oral consumption of  CJC, a volunteer was given 16\u2009oz of either water or CJC. Urine samples were  collected at 0, 2, 4, 6, and 8 hours after consumption of a single dose. The  ability of compounds in the urine to influence bacterial adhesion was tested for  six clinical uropathogenic E. coli strains, including four P-fimbriated strains  (B37, CFT073, BF1023, and J96) and two strains not expressing P-fimbriae but  exhibiting mannose-resistant hemagglutination (B73 and B78). A non-fimbriated  strain, HB101, was used as a control. Atomic force microscopy (AFM) was used to  measure the adhesion force between a silicon nitride probe and bacteria treated  with urine samples. Within 2 hours after CJC consumption, bacteria of the  clinical strains treated with the corresponding urine sample demonstrated lower  adhesion forces than those treated with urine collected before CJC consumption.  The adhesion forces continued decreasing with time after CJC consumption over  the 8-hour measurement period. The adhesion forces of bacteria after exposure to  urine collected following water consumption did not change. HB101 showed low  adhesion forces following both water and CJC consumption, and these did not  change over time. The AFM adhesion force measurements were consistent with the  results of a hemagglutination assay, confirming that oral consumption of CJC  could act against adhesion of uropathogenic E. coli.', 'It has been established that the urothelial mucin layer functions as a bacterial  anti-adherence factor. Intravesical Bacillus Calmette-Guerin is used to treat  patients with superficial bladder cancer. The proposed mechanism of action of  Bacillus Calmette-Guerin is adherence to the urothelium with induction of an  immunologic and/or inflammatory response. The current study was designed to  determine if rabbit bladder mucin removal results in increased Bacillus  Calmette-Guerin urothelial adherence. PAS and colloidal iron stains were used to  demonstrate that intravesical instillation of 50% acetone renders rabbit bladder  urothelium mucin deficient. The urothelium remains mucin deficient at two hours,  but by 24 hours the mucin layer has been regenerated. Two hours following  intravesical 3H-labeled Escherichia coli administration, bacterial adherence was  29-fold greater in mucin deficient than mucin intact rabbits (p = 0.05). By 12  hours, the difference in adherence was not significant. Two hours following  intravesical administration of 3H-labeled Bacillus Calmette Guerin, mucosal  adherence was 21-fold greater in mucin deficient compared to mucin intact  rabbits (p = 0.002). After mucin removal, Bacillus Calmette Guerin urothelial  adherence was significantly increased. The significant increase in Bacillus  Calmette Guerin adherence after mucin removal may be clinically exploitable.', 'Question Plusieurs enfants de ma clinique se rétablissent d’une infection des  voies urinaires (IVU).

Stone composition data was separated  into gender and age-groups RESULTS: From the 791 stones analysed between 2009 and 2011, calcium oxalate  remains the dominant type accounting for 64% of stones in our dataset, which  compares to 68% from both the 1970s and 1980s. Uric acid stones contributed 16%  of contemporary stone compositions, comparable to 16% in the 1970s and 17% in  the 1980s. Struvite stones showed a decreasing trend from 14% in the 1970s, to  12% in the 1980s and 7% in the current data. For struvite stones, while the  female 21-30 age-group was the most prolific for struvite stone formation in the  1980s, the peak group in contemporaneous records is 61-70 year-old men. CONCLUSION: Stone composition in Australia has remained relatively static over  the past 30 years. Modifications in diet and body habitus have not resulted in  significant changes in the proportion of uric acid and calcium oxalate stones  detected. The decreasing trend in the proportion of struvite stones most likely  reflects improved management of urinary tract infections within the Australian  population.', 'Flavonoids, present in high levels in cranberries, are potent bioactives known  for their health-promoting benefits, but cranberry beverages (CB) are not  typically recommended as part of a healthy diet.

Atomic force microscopy was used to probe  the adhesion forces between E. coli (nonfimbriated strain HB101 and the  P-fimbriated variant HB101pDC1) and a model surface (silicon nitride), to  determine the effect of growth in cranberry products on bacterial adhesion.  Bacteria were grown in tryptic soy broth supplemented with either light  cranberry juice cocktail (L-CJC) or cranberry proanthocyanidins (PACs). Growth  of E. coli HB101pDC1 and HB101 in L-CJC or PACs resulted in a decrease in  adhesion forces with increasing number of cultures. In a macroscale  bacteria-uroepithelial cell adhesion assay a decrease in bacterial attachment  was observed for E. coli HB101pDC1 grown in L-CJC or PACs. This effect was  reversible because bacteria that were regrown in cranberry-free medium regained  their ability to attach to uroepithelial cells, and their adhesion forces  reverted to the values observed in the control condition. Exposure to increasing  concentrations of L-CJC resulted in a decrease of bacterial attachment to  uroepithelial cells for the P-fimbriated strain after L-CJC treatment (27% by  weight) and after PACs treatment (345.8 microg/mL). Cranberry products affect  the surface properties, such as fimbriae and lipopolysaccharides, and adhesion  of fimbriated and nonfimbriated E. coli. The concentration of cranberry products  and the number of cultures the bacteria were exposed to cranberry determines how  much the adhesion forces and attachment are altered.', ""Rahimi, R. Creatine supplementation decreases oxidative DNA damage and lipid  peroxidation induced by a single bout of resistance exercise.

Heretofore, Cr's positive  therapeutic benefits in various oxidative stress-associated diseases have been  reported in the literature and, recently, Cr has also been shown to exert direct  antioxidant effects. Therefore, the purpose of this study was to investigate the  effects of an acute bout of resistance exercise (RE) on oxidative stress  response and oxidative DNA damage in male athletes and whether supplementation  with Cr could negate any observed differences. Twenty-seven resistance-trained  men were randomly divided into a Cr supplementation group (the Cr group [21.6 ±  3.6 years], taking 4 × 5 g Cr monohydrate per day) or a placebo (PL)  supplementation group (the PL group [21.2 ± 3.2 years], taking 4 × 5 g  maltodextrin per day). A double-blind research design was employed for a 7-day  supplementation period. Before and after the seventh day of supplementation, the  subjects performed an RE protocol (7 sets of 4 exercises using 60-90 1  repetition maximum) in the flat pyramid loading pattern. Blood and urine samples  taken before, immediately, and 24-hour postexercise were analyzed for plasma  malondialdehyde (MDA) and urinary 8-hydroxy-2-deoxyguanosine (8-OHdG) excretion.  Before the supplementation period, a significant increase in the urinary 8-OHdG  excretion and plasma MDA levels was observed after RE. The Cr supplementation  induces a significant increase in athletics performance, and it attenuated the  changes observed in the urinary 8-OHdG excretion and plasma MDA. These results  indicate that Cr supplementation reduced oxidative DNA damage and lipid  peroxidation induced by a single bout of RE."", 'Most research suggests that ingestion of cranberry juice may be useful in  preventing urinary tract infections. This pilot study examines the effect of  drinking moderate amounts of commercially available cranberry juice cocktail on  urinary pH in older, institutionalized adults. The results of the study have  implications for home care nurses who have similar patients in their case loads.', 'Type 1 fimbriae and flagella, two surface organelles critical for colonization  of the urinary tract by uropathogenic Escherichia coli (UPEC), mediate opposing  virulence objectives. Type 1 fimbriae facilitate adhesion to mucosal cells and  promote bacterial persistence in the urinary tract, while flagella propel  bacteria through urine and along mucous layers during ascension to the upper  urinary tract. Using a transposon screen of the E. coli CFT073 fim locked-ON  (L-ON) mutant, a construct that constitutively expresses type 1 fimbriae and  represses motility, we identified six mutants that exhibited a partial  restoration of motility. Among these six mutated genes was mutS, which encodes a  component of the methyl-directed mismatch repair (MMR) system. When complemented  with mutS in trans, motility was again repressed. To determine whether the MMR  system, in general, is involved in this reciprocal control, we characterized the  effects of gene deletions of other MMR components on UPEC motility. Isogenic  deletions of mutS, mutH, and mutL were constructed in both wild-type CFT073 and  fim L-ON backgrounds. All MMR mutants showed an increase in motility in the  wild-type background, and ΔmutH and ΔmutS mutations increased motility in the  fim L-ON background. Cochallenge of the wild-type strain with an MMR-defective  strain showed a subtle but significant competitive advantage in the bladder and  spleen for the MMR mutant using the murine model of ascending urinary tract  infection after 48 h. Our findings demonstrate that the MMR system generally  affects the reciprocal regulation of motility and adherence and thus could  contribute to UPEC pathogenesis during urinary tract infections.']]]","Cranberry juice helps combat urinary tract infections due to its ability to inhibit the formation of biofilm by uropathogenic Escherichia coli (UPEC). Specifically, cranberry juice contains anti-adhesive components that prevent bacteria from adhering to the urothelial cells lining the urinary tract. This is supported by studies showing that cranberry juice reduces bacterial adhesion forces to uroepithelial cells, particularly in non-fimbriated strains like HB101 and fimbriated variants like HB101pDC1. The mechanism involves changes in bacterial surface properties, such as fimbriae and lipopolysaccharides, which are affected by cranberry products.","[{'Exact': array([ 8.52687462e+00,  6.27660908e+01,  4.68251968e+00, -4.23779169e+00,

How are cryptic unstable transcripts (CUTs) defined?,"[[[""Studies of yeast transcription have revealed the widespread distribution of  intergenic RNA polymerase II transcripts. These cryptic unstable transcripts  (CUTs) are rapidly degraded by the nuclear exosome. Yeast RNA binding proteins  Nrd1 and Nab3 direct termination of sn/snoRNAs and recently have also been  implicated in premature transcription termination of the NRD1 gene. In this  paper, we show that Nrd1 and Nab3 are required for transcription termination of  CUTs. In nrd1 and nab3 mutants, we observe 3'-extended transcripts originating  from CUT promoters but failing to terminate through the Nrd1- and Nab3-directed  pathway. Nrd1 and Nab3 colocalize to regions of the genome expressing antisense  CUTs, and these transcripts require yeast nuclear exosome and TRAMP components  for degradation. Dissection of a CUT terminator reveals a minimal element  sufficient for Nrd1- and Nab3-directed termination. These results suggest that  transcription termination of CUTs directed by Nrd1 and Nab3 is a prerequisite  for rapid degradation by the nuclear exosome."", ""Propionic acidemia is an autosomal recessive disorder caused by a deficiency in  the mitochondrial enzyme propionyl-CoA carboxylase (PCC). PCC is composed of two  subunits, alpha and beta, encoded by the PCCA and PCCB genes, respectively. We  analyzed mutations of the PCCA gene using patients' fibroblasts diagnosed with  alpha subunit deficiency. By RT-PCR, four of 12 cell lines examined appeared to  have a larger transcript present at a level comparable with that of the expected  normal species. Sequencing of the larger transcriptrevealed an 84 bp insertion  at nt 1209 of the codingsequence. Its incorporation in the transcript results in  translation termination due to the presence of two in-frame stop codons. The 84  bp insertion was found to originate from the intron between nt 1209 and 1210.  Consensus splice donor and acceptor sites were found at the 3'- and 5'-ends of  the insertion, respectively. The insertion was also found in the remaining eight  cell lines as well as in normal cells, but at a muchreduced level compared with  the normal lengthsequence. Mutation analysis of the four cell lines showing  seemingly elevated levels of the insertion sequence revealed one nonsense  mutation (R288X), two frameshift deletions (700del5 and 1115del4) and one splice  mutation (1671IVS+5G-->C) as expressed alleles. We conclude that the common  characteristic of the four cell lines is that they contain mRNA destabilizing  mutations that reduce the mRNA level of the normal length sequence.  Consequently, the low levels of cryptic mRNAs become detectable at a level  similar to that of the residual level of the normal length mRNA. We suggest that  screening for an increased proportion of the 84 bp insertion by RT-PCR can be  used as a rapid assay for RNA destabilizing mutations. Our results suggest  caution in associating such mutations with aberrant mRNA species, such as  cryptic splice products, which may instead be part of the 'background noise' of  the splicing machinery."", ""MOTIVATION: The length of the 3' untranslated region (3' UTR) of an mRNA is  essential for many biological activities such as mRNA stability, sub-cellular  localization, protein translation, protein binding and translation efficiency.  Moreover, correlation between diseases and the shortening (or lengthening) of 3'  UTRs has been reported in the literature. This length is largely determined by  the polyadenylation cleavage site in the mRNA. As alternative polyadenylation  (APA) sites are common in mammalian genes, several tools have been published  recently for detecting APA sites from RNA-Seq data or performing  shortening/lengthening analysis. These tools consider either up to only two APA  sites in a gene or only APA sites that occur in the last exon of a gene,  although a gene may generally have more than two APA sites and an APA site may  sometimes occur before the last exon. Furthermore, the tools are unable to  integrate the analysis of shortening/lengthening events with APA site detection. RESULTS: We propose a new tool, called TAPAS, for detecting novel APA sites from  RNA-Seq data. It can deal with more than two APA sites in a gene as well as APA  sites that occur before the last exon. The tool is based on an existing method  for finding change points in time series data, but some filtration techniques  are also adopted to remove change points that are likely false APA sites. It is  then extended to identify APA sites that are expressed differently between two  biological samples and genes that contain 3' UTRs with shortening/lengthening  events. Our extensive experiments on simulated and real RNA-Seq data demonstrate  that TAPAS outperforms the existing tools for APA site detection or  shortening/lengthening analysis significantly. AVAILABILITY AND IMPLEMENTATION: https://github.com/arefeen/TAPAS. SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: Supplementary data are available at Bioinformatics  online."", 'It is well established that eukaryotic genomes are pervasively transcribed  producing cryptic unstable transcripts (CUTs). However, the mechanisms  regulating pervasive transcription are not well understood. Here, we report that  the fission yeast CENP-B homolog Abp1 plays an important role in preventing  pervasive transcription. We show that loss of abp1 results in the accumulation  of CUTs, which are targeted for degradation by the exosome pathway. These CUTs  originate from different types of genomic features, but the highest increase  corresponds to Tf2 retrotransposons and rDNA repeats, where they map along the  entire elements. In the absence of abp1, increased RNAPII-Ser5P occupancy is  observed throughout the Tf2 coding region and, unexpectedly, RNAPII-Ser5P is  enriched at rDNA repeats. Loss of abp1 also results in Tf2 derepression and  increased nucleolus size. Altogether these results suggest that Abp1 prevents  pervasive RNAPII transcription of repetitive DNA elements (i.e., Tf2 and rDNA  repeats) from internal cryptic sites.', 'MOTIVATION: RNA-Seq technology is promising to uncover many novel alternative  splicing events, gene fusions and other variations in RNA transcripts. For an  accurate detection and quantification of transcripts, it is important to resolve  the mapping ambiguity for those RNA-Seq reads that can be mapped to multiple  loci: >17% of the reads from mouse RNA-Seq data and 50% of the reads from some  plant RNA-Seq data have multiple mapping loci. In this study, we show how to  resolve the mapping ambiguity in the presence of novel transcriptomic events  such as exon skipping and novel indels towards accurate downstream analysis. We  introduce ORMAN ( O ptimal R esolution of M ultimapping A mbiguity of R N A-Seq  Reads), which aims to compute the minimum number of potential transcript  products for each gene and to assign each multimapping read to one of these  transcripts based on the estimated distribution of the region covering the read.  ORMAN achieves this objective through a combinatorial optimization formulation,  which is solved through well-known approximation algorithms, integer linear  programs and heuristics. RESULTS: On a simulated RNA-Seq dataset including a random subset of transcripts  from the UCSC database, the performance of several state-of-the-art methods for  identifying and quantifying novel transcripts, such as Cufflinks, IsoLasso and  CLIIQ, is significantly improved through the use of ORMAN. Furthermore, in an  experiment using real RNA-Seq reads, we show that ORMAN is able to resolve  multimapping to produce coverage values that are similar to the original  distribution, even in genes with highly non-uniform coverage. AVAILABILITY: ORMAN is available at http://orman.sf.net', 'Messenger RNAs (mRNAs) that contain premature translation termination codons  (PTCs) are targeted for rapid degradation in all eukaryotes tested. The  mechanisms of nonsense-mediated mRNA decay (NMD) have been described in  considerable detail, but the biological roles of NMD in wild-type organisms are  poorly understood. mRNAs of wild-type organisms known to be degraded by NMD  (""natural targets"" of NMD) include by-products of regulated alternative  splicing, out-of-frame mRNAs derived from unproductive gene rearrangements,  cytoplasmic pre-mRNAs, endogenous retroviral and transposon RNAs, and mRNAs  having upstream open reading frames or other unusual sequence features. NMD may  function to eliminate aberrant PTC-containing mRNAs in order to protect cells  from expression of potentially deleterious truncated proteins. Pseudogenes are  nonfunctional genes or gene fragments that accumulate mutations through genetic  drift. Such mutations will often introduce shifts of reading frame and/or PTCs,  and mRNAs of expressed pseudogenes may thus be substrates of NMD. We demonstrate  that mRNAs expressed from C. elegans pseudogenes are degraded by NMD and discuss  possible implications for both mRNA surveillance and protein evolution. We  describe an expressed pseudogene that encodes a small nucleolar RNA (snoRNA)  within an intron and suggest this represents an evolutionary intermediate  between snoRNA-encoding host genes that do or do not encode proteins.', 'Recent studies on yeast transcriptome have revealed the presence of a large set  of RNA polymerase II transcripts mapping to intergenic and antisense regions or  overlapping canonical genes. Most of these ncRNAs (ncRNAs) are subject to  termination by the Nrd1-dependent pathway and rapid degradation by the nuclear  exosome and have been dubbed cryptic unstable transcripts (CUTs). CUTs are often  considered as by-products of transcriptional noise, but in an increasing number  of cases they play a central role in the control of gene expression. Regulatory  mechanisms involving expression of a CUT are diverse and include attenuation,  transcriptional interference, and alternative transcription start site choice.  This review focuses on the impact of cryptic transcription on gene expression,  describes the role of the Nrd1-complex as the main actor in preventing  nonfunctional and potentially harmful transcription, and details a few systems  where expression of a CUT has an essential regulatory function. We also  summarize the most recent studies concerning other types of ncRNAs and their  possible role in regulation.', ""BACKGROUND: Cryptic unstable transcripts (CUTs) are a largely unexplored class  of nuclear exosome degraded, non-coding RNAs in budding yeast. It is highly  debated whether CUT transcription has a functional role in the cell or whether  CUTs represent noise in the yeast transcriptome. We sought to ascertain the  extent of conserved CUT expression across a variety of Saccharomyces yeast  strains to further understand and characterize the nature of CUT expression. RESULTS: We sequenced the WT and rrp6Δ transcriptomes of three S.cerevisiae  strains: S288c, Σ1278b, JAY291 and the S.paradoxus strain N17 and utilized a  hidden Markov model to annotate CUTs in these four strains. Utilizing a four-way  genomic alignment we identified a large population of CUTs with conserved  syntenic expression across all four strains. By identifying configurations of  gene-CUT pairs, where CUT expression originates from the gene 5' or 3'  nucleosome free region, we observed distinct gene expression trends specific to  these configurations which were most prevalent in the presence of conserved CUT  expression. Divergent pairs correlate with higher expression of genes, and  convergent pairs correlate with reduced gene expression. CONCLUSIONS: Our RNA-seq based method has greatly expanded upon previous CUT  annotations in S.cerevisiae underscoring the extensive and pervasive nature of  unstable transcription. Furthermore we provide the first assessment of conserved  CUT expression in yeast and globally demonstrate possible modes of CUT-based  regulation of gene expression."", 'BACKGROUND: RNA-seq data is currently underutilized, in part because it is  difficult to predict the functional impact of alternate transcription events.  Recent software improvements in full-length transcript deconvolution prompted us  to develop spliceR, an R package for classification of alternative splicing and  prediction of coding potential. RESULTS: spliceR uses the full-length transcript output from RNA-seq assemblers  to detect single or multiple exon skipping, alternative donor and acceptor  sites, intron retention, alternative first or last exon usage, and mutually  exclusive exon events. For each of these events spliceR also annotates the  genomic coordinates of the differentially spliced elements, facilitating  downstream sequence analysis. For each transcript isoform fraction values are  calculated to identify transcript switching between conditions. Lastly, spliceR  predicts the coding potential, as well as the potential nonsense mediated decay  (NMD) sensitivity of each transcript. CONCLUSIONS: spliceR is an easy-to-use tool that extends the usability of  RNA-seq and assembly technologies by allowing greater depth of annotation of  RNA-seq data. spliceR is implemented as an R package and is freely available  from the Bioconductor repository (  http://www.bioconductor.org/packages/2.13/bioc/html/spliceR.html).', ""A complete description of the transcriptome of an organism is crucial for a  comprehensive understanding of how it functions and how its transcriptional  networks are controlled, and may provide insights into the organism's evolution.  Despite the status of Saccharomyces cerevisiae as arguably the most well-studied  model eukaryote, we still do not have a full catalog or understanding of all its  genes. In order to interrogate the transcriptome of S. cerevisiae for low  abundance or rapidly turned over transcripts, we deleted elements of the RNA  degradation machinery with the goal of preferentially increasing the relative  abundance of such transcripts. We then used high-resolution tiling microarrays  and ultra high-throughput sequencing (UHTS) to identify, map, and validate  unannotated transcripts that are more abundant in the RNA degradation mutants  relative to wild-type cells. We identified 365 currently unannotated  transcripts, the majority presumably representing low abundance or short-lived  RNAs, of which 185 are previously unknown and unique to this study. It is likely  that many of these are cryptic unstable transcripts (CUTs), which are rapidly  degraded and whose function(s) within the cell are still unclear, while others  may be novel functional transcripts. Of the 185 transcripts we identified as  novel to our study, greater than 80 percent come from regions of the genome that  have lower conservation scores amongst closely related yeast species than 85  percent of the verified ORFs in S. cerevisiae. Such regions of the genome have  typically been less well-studied, and by definition transcripts from these  regions will distinguish S. cerevisiae from these closely related species.""]]]","Cryptic unstable transcripts (CUTs) are defined as rapidly degraded, non-coding RNA transcripts produced by RNA polymerase II that are not part of the protein-coding genes. They are characterized by their instability, being quickly degraded by the nuclear exosome, and their prevalence in intergenic and antisense regions of the genome. CUTs are considered cryptic because they are not typically recognized as functional during normal cellular processes.","[{'Exact': array([25.8567214 , -1.26318878,  1.28560755,  5.14872102, -2.21457883,

What is Abbreviated Injury Scale (AIS) used to determine?,"[[[""In-hospital complications in trauma patients are frequent and associated with  increased morbidity and mortality. The aim of this study was to analyze the  association between posttraumatic complications and the injured body region,  injury and trauma severity, length of stay, and mortality in hospitalized trauma  patients. This observational and retrospective study included 147 trauma  patients with posttraumatic complications hospitalized in a university hospital  located in São Paulo, Brazil. The injury and trauma severity was measured using  the Abbreviated Injury Scale (AIS) and the Injury Severity Score (ISS),  respectively. The association between variables was verified applying χ test,  Fisher exact text, likelihood ratio, and Mann-Whitney U test, considering  significance level of 5%. The most frequent in-hospital complications were  infectious, cardiovascular, metabolic, and renal. Patients with head injury AIS  score of 3 or more had higher percentage of neurological complications and those  with lower extremity injury AIS score of less than 3 had higher percentage of  metabolic and renal complications. There was no association between thoracic  injury and cardiovascular complications, nor between types of complications and  trauma severity (ISS). Patients without cardiovascular complication and those  with infections had longer hospital length of stay, and mortality was higher in  those with cardiovascular complications. Complication's studies in trauma  patients may contribute to identify events related with poor outcome and to  implement specific measures for improving quality of trauma care and patient  security."", 'Trauma, which accounts for a substantial part of the morbidity and mortality in  industrial nations, is a natural area of interest for orthopaedic surgeons.  Trauma, and trauma prevention, can be conveniently studied in emergency rooms  and casualty units which are often run by hospital orthopaedic departments.

The Abbreviated Injury  Scale is a system developed in the United States for ranking the severity of  specific trauma lesions. This paper discusses general issues relating to injury  scaling and accident epidemiology research.', ""OBJECTIVE: The purpose of this study is to investigate the injury patterns of  noncatastrophic accidents by individual age groups. METHODS: Data were collected from the Korean In-Depth Accident Study database  based on actual accident investigation. The noncatastrophic criteria were  classified according to U.S. experts from the Centers for Disease Control and  Prevention's recommendations for field triage guidelines of high-risk automobile  crash criteria by vehicle intrusions more than 12 in. on occupant sites  (including the roof) and more than 18 in. on any site. The Abbreviated Injury  Scale (AIS) was used to determine injury patterns for each body region. Severely  injured patients were classified as Maximum Abbreviated Injury Scale (MAIS) 3 or  higher. RESULTS: In this study, the most significant injury regions were the head and  neck, extremities, and thorax. In addition, the incidence of severe injury among  elderly patients was nearly 1.6 times higher than that of non-elderly patients.  According to age group, injured body regions among the elderly were the thorax,  head and neck, and extremities, in that order. For the non-elderly groups, these  were head and neck, extremities, and thorax. Severe injury rates were slightly  different for the elderly group (head and neck, abdomen) and non-elderly group  (thorax, head and neck). CONCLUSIONS: In both age groups, the rate of severe injury is proportional to an  increase in crush extent zone. Front airbag deployment may have a relatively  significant relationship to severe injuries."", ""The original and modified Ottawa Ankle Rules (OARs) were developed as clinical  decision rules for use in emergency departments. However, the OARs have not been  evaluated as an acute clinical evaluation tool. OBJECTIVE: To evaluate the measures of diagnostic accuracy of the OARs in the  acute setting. METHODS: The OARs were applied to all appropriate ankle injuries at 2 colleges  (athletics and club sports) and 21 high schools. The outcomes of OARs,  diagnosis, and decision for referral were collected by the athletic trainers  (ATs) at each of the locations. Contingency tables were created for evaluations  completed within 1 h for which radiographs were obtained. From these data the  sensitivity, specificity, positive and negative likelihood ratios, and positive  and negative predictive values were calculated. RESULTS: The OARs met the criteria for radiographs in 100 of the 124 cases, of  which 38 were actually referred for imaging. Based on radiographic findings in  an acute setting, the OARs (n = 38) had a high sensitivity (.88) and are good  predictors to rule out the presence of a fracture. Low specificity (0.00)  results led to a high number of false positives and low positive predictive  values (.18). CONCLUSION: When applied during the first hour after injury the OARs  significantly overestimate the need for radiographs. However, a negative finding  rules out the need to obtain radiographs. It appears the AT's decision making  based on the totality of the examination findings is the best filter in  determining referral for radiographs."", ""BACKGROUND: Injury severity measures are based either on the Abbreviated Injury  Scale (AIS) or the International Classification of diseases (ICD). The latter is  more convenient because routinely collected by clinicians for administrative  reasons. To exploit this advantage, a proprietary program that maps ICD-9-CM  into AIS codes has been used for many years. Recently, a program called ICDPIC  trauma and developed in the USA has become available free of charge for  registered STATA users. We compared the ICDPIC calculated Injury Severity Score  (ISS) with the one from direct, prospective AIS coding by expert trauma  registrars (dAIS). METHODS: The administrative records of the 289 major trauma cases admitted to  the hospital of Udine-Italy from 1 July 2004 to 30 June 2005 and enrolled in the  Italian Trauma Registry were retrieved and ICDPIC-ISS was calculated. The  agreement between ICDPIC-ISS and dAIS-ISS was assessed by Cohen's Kappa and  Bland-Altman charts. We then plotted the differences between the 2 scores  against the ratio between the number of traumatic ICD-9-CM codes and the number  of dAIS codes for each patient (DIARATIO). We also compared the absolute  differences in ISS among 3 groups identified by DIARATIO. The discriminative  power for survival of both scores was finally calculated by ROC curves. RESULTS: The scores matched in 33/272 patients (12.1%, k 0.07) and, when  categorized, in 80/272 (22.4%, k 0.09). The Bland-Altman average difference was  6.36 (limits: minus 22.0 to plus 34.7). ICDPIC-ISS of 75 was particularly  unreliable. The differences increased (p < 0.01) as DIARATIO increased  indicating incomplete administrative coding as a cause of the differences. The  area under the curve of ICDPIC-ISS was lower (0.63 vs. 0.76, p = 0.02). CONCLUSIONS: Despite its great potential convenience, ICPIC-ISS agreed poorly  with its conventionally calculated counterpart. Its discriminative power for  survival was also significantly lower. Incomplete ICD-9-CM coding was a main  cause of these findings. Because this quality of coding is standard in Italy and  probably in other European countries, its effects on the performances of other  trauma scores based on ICD administrative data deserve further research. Mapping  ICD-9-CM code 862.8 to AIS of 6 is an overestimation."", 'Injuries from piercing or cutting instruments or objects are commonly seen in  the pediatric emergency department.

This article describes a study designed  to address these reliability issues. Each of 15 raters with varying  qualifications was asked to identify AIS code injuries sustained by 375 trauma  patients admitted to four Baltimore area hospitals. Results showed that as a  group, physicians and nurses tend to be more reliable in their ratings than  either emergency medical technicians (EMTs) or nonclinical technicians, although  a research assistant who is well trained in AIS coding and is a diligent worker  can use the AIS to code severity as reliably as the physicians when sufficient  information is provided in the medical chart. Reliability of AIS scoring was  somewhat higher for blunt (vehicular and nonvehicular) versus penetrating  injuries.', 'INTRODUCTION: Traumatic brain injury (TBI) is a major public health problem,  particularly in children. Prognostication of injury severity at the time of  presentation is difficult. The Abbreviated Injury Scale (AIS) is a commonly used  anatomical-based coding system created to classify and describe injury severity  after initial presentation, once test results are able to better define the  anatomical characteristics of the injury. We hypothesize that the Head AIS can  predict discharge destination in children after TBI. METHODS: The trauma registry database for a Pediatric Level 1 Trauma center was  queried for patients age ≤14\xa0years from 2006 to 2015 with a Head AIS>2. All  diagnoses with head AIS>2 were retrieved. Since one patient can have multiple  diagnoses with an AIS>2, we selected the diagnosis with highest Head AIS  associated with each patient. The demographics, length of stay, and the  discharge disposition of patients were retrieved. Descriptive statistics were  performed and association of Head AIS with the length of stay and discharge  disposition was determined using logistic regression. RESULTS: 393 pediatric patients (age≤14\xa0years) with an Head AIS ≥3, (64.0%  males, mean age\xa0=\xa06.2\xa0S.D. 4.58) presented over 10\xa0years. Head AIS was strongly  associated with mortality; with 0.8%, 1.1% and 42.0% of patients with Head AIS  of 3, 4 and 5, respectively, dying - odds ratio for Head AIS 5 over Head AIS  3\xa0=\xa089 (logistic regression, p-value<0.001). 80.0% of deaths (23 patients) in  this cohort occurred within 24-h of presentation. Head AIS was associated with  an increase likelihood of discharge to rehabilitation with 1.2%, 7.7% and 47.0%  of survivors discharging to rehabilitation for Head AIS of 3, 4 and 5. CONCLUSION: Head AIS can reliably predict discharge disposition to home, rehab  or death. Calculation of Head AIS prior to discharge could lead to accurate  prediction of discharge destination.', 'Injuries from piercing or cutting instruments or objects are commonly seen in  the pediatric emergency department.

Tumor-treating fields are effective for treatment of which cancers?,"[[['Tumor treating fields (TTFields) are low intensity, intermediate frequency,  alternating electric fields used to treat cancerous tumors. This novel treatment  modality effectively inhibits the growth of solid tumors in vivo and has shown  promise in pilot clinical trials in patients with advanced stage solid tumors.  TTFields were tested for their potential to inhibit metastatic spread of solid  tumors to the lungs in two animal models: (1) Mice injected with malignant  melanoma cells (B16F10) into the tail vein, (2) New Zealand White rabbits  implanted with VX-2 tumors within the kidney capsule. Mice and rabbits were  treated using two-directional TTFields at 100-200 kHz. Animals were either  monitored for survival, or sacrificed for pathological and histological analysis  of the lungs. The total number of lung surface metastases and the absolute  weight of the lungs were both significantly lower in TTFields treated mice then  in sham control mice. TTFields treated rabbits survived longer than sham control  animals. This extension in survival was found to be due to an inhibition of  metastatic spread, seeding or growth in the lungs of TTFields treated rabbits  compared to controls. Histologically, extensive peri- and intra-tumoral immune  cell infiltration was seen in TTFields treated rabbits only. These results raise  the possibility that in addition to their proven inhibitory effect on the growth  of solid tumors, TTFields may also have clinical benefit in the prevention of  metastatic spread from primary tumors.', 'The results of various in vitro analyses indicate there is an active immune  response against antigens associated with human malignancies. This immune  response apparently can be augmented by nonspecific immunologic stimulates such  as BCG. These agents are effective for destroying tumor when injected locally  into intracutaneous disease but are not as effective for subcutaneous disease.  Preliminary clinical trials indicated that immune stimulants are effective when  administered systemically. The effect is only minimal for diseminated disease,  but the therapeutic benefit is clearly augmented for patients with a minimal  residual tumor burden, such as those patients with metastases to regional lymph  nodes. Thus immunotherapy is a systemically active mode of therapy. Its toxicity  is minimal, and it appears to be effective in a wide spectrum of the disease.  However, immunotherapy is not effective for a large residual tumor burden;  consequently it must be used in combination with other modes of treatment such  as irradiation therapy or chemotherapy. Early experiences with BCG immunotherapy  for malignant melanoma and C. parvum for oat cell carcinoma are encouraging. It  is remarkable that a nonspecific immunologic stimulant does, in fact, have this  effect. Immunotherapy experiments in animals suggest that in order to achieve  maximal benefit. BCG must have close contact with tumor cells or must be  combined with a tumor-associated antigen. If these principles are true for man,  it would seem that improvements for nonspecific immunotherapy in human neoplasms  would be further augmented if a tumor-related antigen could be extracted from  human tumours and combined with a nonspecific immunologic stimulant.', 'PURPOSE: In this study factors are analyzed that may potentially influence the  site of failure in pediatric medulloblastoma. Patient-related, disease-related,  and treatment-related variables are analyzed with a special focus on  radiotherapy time-dose and technical factors. METHODS AND MATERIALS: Eighty-six children and adolescents with a diagnosis of  medulloblastoma were treated in Switzerland during the period 1972-1991.  Postoperative megavoltage radiotherapy was delivered to all patients. Simulation  and portal films of the whole-brain irradiation (WBI) fields were  retrospectively reviewed in 77 patients. The distance from the field margin to  the cribiform plate and to the floor of the temporal fossa was carefully  assessed and correlated with supratentorial failure-free survival. In 19  children the spine was treated with high-energy electron beams, the remainder  with megavoltage photons. Simulation and port films of the posterior fossa  fields were also reviewed in 72 patients. The field size and the field limits  were evaluated and correlated with posterior fossa failure-free survival. RESULTS: In 36 patients (47%) the WBI margins were judged to miss the inferior  portion of the frontal and temporal lobes. Twelve patients failed in the  supratentorial region and 9 of these patients belonged to the group of 36  children in whom the inferior portion of the brain had been underdosed. On  multivariate analysis only field correctness was retained as being significantly  correlated with supratentorial failure-free survival (p = 0.049). Neither the  total dose to the spinal theca nor the treatment technique (electron vs. photon  beams) were significantly correlated with outcome. Posterior fossa failure-free  survival was not influenced by total dose, overall treatment time, field size,  or field margin correctness. Overall survival was not influenced by any of the  radiotherapy-related technical factors. CONCLUSION: A correlation between WBI field correctness and supratentorial  failure-free survival was observed. Treatment protocols should be considered  that limit supratentorial irradiation mainly to subsites at highest risk of  relapse. Optimized conformal therapy or proton beam therapy may help to reach  this goal. Treating the spine with electron beams was not deletereous. A  significant correlation between local control and other technical factors was  not observed, including those relating to posterior fossa treatment. The use of  small conformal tumor bed boost fields may be prefered to the larger posterior  fossa fields usually considered as the standard treatment approach.', 'OBJECTIVES: Tumor Treating Fields (TTFields) are a non-invasive cancer treatment  modality approved for the treatment of patients with recurrent glioblastoma. The  present study determined the efficacy and mechanism of action of TTFields in  preclinical models of pancreatic cancer. METHODS: The effect of TTFields in vitro was assessed using cell counts,  clonogenic assays, cell cycle analysis and analysis of mitotic figures. The  effect in vivo effect was studied in the PC1-0 hamster pancreatic cancer model. RESULTS: Application of TTFields in vitro showed a significant decrease in cell  count, an increase in cell volume and reduced clonogenicity. Further analysis  demonstrated significant increase in the number of abnormal mitotic figures, as  well as a decrease in G2-M cell population. In hamsters with orthotopic  pancreatic tumors, TTFields significantly reduced tumor volume accompanied by an  increase in the frequency of abnormal mitotic events. TTFields efficacy was  enhanced both in vitro and in vivo when combined with chemotherapy. CONCLUSIONS: These results provide the first evidence that TTFields serve as an  effective antimitotic treatment in preclinical pancreatic cancer models and have  a long term negative effect on cancer cell survival. These results make TTFields  an attractive candidate for testing in the treatment of patients with pancreatic  cancer.', ""The NovoTTF™-100A system is a portable device that delivers intermediate  frequency alternating electric fields (TTFields, tumor treating fields) through  transducer arrays arranged on the scalp. An ongoing trial is assessing its  efficacy for newly diagnosed glioblastoma multiforme (GBM) and it has been  FDA-approved for recurrent GBM.The fields are believed to interfere with  formation of the mitotic spindle as well as to affect polar molecules at  telophase, thus preventing cell division. The position of the four arrays is  unique to each patient and optimized based on the patient's imaging. We present  three patients with GBM in whom the fields were adjusted at recurrence and the  effects of each adjustment. We believe there may be a higher risk of treatment  failure on the edges of the field where the field strength may be lower. The  first patient underwent subtotal resection, radiotherapy with temozolomide  (TMZ), and then began NovoTTF Therapy with metronomic TMZ. She had good control  for nine months; however, new bifrontal lesions developed, and her fields were  adjusted with a subsequent radiographic response. Over the next five months, her  tumor burden increased and death was preceded by a right insular recurrence. A  second patient underwent two resections followed by radiotherapy/TMZ and NovoTTF  Therapy/TMZ. Six months later, two new distal lesions were noted, and he  underwent further resection with adjustment of his fields. He remained stable  over the subsequent year on NovoTTF Therapy and bevacizumab. A third patient on  NovoTTF Therapy/TMZ remained stable for two years but developed a small, slow  growing enhancing lesion, which was resected, and his fields were adjusted  accordingly. Interestingly, the pathology showed giant cell GBM with multiple  syncitial-type cells. Based on these observations, we believe that field  strength may play a role in 'out of field' recurrences and that either the  presence of a certain field strength may select for cells that are of a  different size or that tumor cells may change size to avoid the effects of the  TTFields."", 'Non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) is one of the leading causes of  cancer-related deaths worldwide. Common treatment modalities for NSCLC include  surgery, radiotherapy, chemotherapy, and, in recent years, the clinical  management paradigm has evolved with the advent of targeted therapies. Despite  such advances, the impact of systemic therapies for advanced disease remains  modest, and as such, the prognosis for patients with NSCLC remains poor.  Standard modalities are not without their respective toxicities and there is a  clear need to improve both efficacy and safety for current management  approaches. Tumor-treating fields (TTFields) are low-intensity,  intermediate-frequency alternating electric fields that disrupt proper spindle  microtubule arrangement, thereby leading to mitotic arrest and ultimately to  cell death. We evaluated the effects of combining TTFields with standard  chemotherapeutic agents on several NSCLC cell lines, both in vitro and in vivo.  Frequency titration curves demonstrated that the inhibitory effects of TTFields  were maximal at 150 kHz for all NSCLC cell lines tested, and that the addition  of TTFields to chemotherapy resulted in enhanced treatment efficacy across all  cell lines. We investigated the response of Lewis lung carcinoma and KLN205  squamous cell carcinoma in mice treated with TTFields in combination with  pemetrexed, cisplatin, or paclitaxel and compared these to the efficacy observed  in mice exposed only to the single agents. Combining TTFields with these  therapeutic agents enhanced treatment efficacy in comparison with the respective  single agents and control groups in all animal models. Together, these findings  suggest that combining TTFields therapy with chemotherapy may provide an  additive efficacy benefit in the management of NSCLC.', 'The tumor microenvironment is a complex assortment of cells that includes a  variety of leukocytes. The overall effect of the microenvironment is to support  the growth of tumors and suppress immune responses. Immunotherapy is a highly  promising form of cancer treatment, but its efficacy can be severely compromised  by an immunosuppressive tumor microenvironment. Chemotherapy and radiation  treatment can mediate tumor reduction through cytotoxic effects, but it is  becoming increasingly clear that these forms of treatment can be used to modify  the tumor microenvironment to liberate tumor antigens and decrease  immunosuppression. Chemotherapy and radiotherapy can be used to modulate the  tumor microenvironment to enhance immunotherapy.', ""Photodynamic therapy is being investigated as an adjuvant treatment for  intracranial neoplasms. The efficacy of this therapy is based on the uptake of  photosensitizer by neoplastic tissue, its clearance from surrounding brain  tissue, and the timing and placement of photoactivating sources. Photofrin-II is  the photosensitizer most actively being investigated. We labeled Photofrin-II  with Indium-111 and studied the uptake and distribution of this agent in 20  patients with intracranial neoplasms, using single photon emission computed  tomography (SPECT) with volume rendering in three dimensions. Of these patients,  16 had malignant glial tumors, 2 had metastatic deposits, 1 had a chordoma, and  1 had a meningioma. Anatomical-spatial data correlated well between the SPECT  images and contrast-enhanced computed tomography or magnetic resonance images.  Regions of focal uptake on SPECT images correlated with the surgical  histopathological findings of the neoplasm. The kinetics of photosensitizer  uptake varied according to the tumor's histological findings, the patient's use  of steroids, and among patients with similar types of tumor histology. Peak  ratios of target-to-nontarget tissue varied from 24 to 72 hours after injection.  The study data show that, to be most effective, photodynamic therapy may need to  be tailored for each patient by correlating SPECT images with anatomical data  produced by computed tomography or magnetic resonance images. Photoactivating  sources then can be placed, using computer-assisted stereotactics, to activate a  prescribed volume of photosensitized tumor at the optimal time for treatment."", 'INTRODUCTION: Local control is fundamental, both for the curative as well as the  palliative treatment of cancer. Tumor treating fields (TTFields) are low  intensity (1 ? 2 V/cm), intermediate frequency (100 ? 200 kHz) alternating  electric fields administered using insulated electrodes placed on the skin  surrounding the region of a malignant tumor. TTFields were shown to destroy  cells within the process of mitosis via apoptosis, thereby inhibiting tumor  growth. TTFields have no effect on non-dividing cells. AREAS COVERED: This article reviews in vitro and in vivo preclinical studies,  demonstrating the activity of TTFields both as a monotherapy as well as in  combination with several cytotoxic agents. Furthermore, it summarizes the  clinical experience with TTFields, mainly in two indications: one in recurrent  glioblastoma multiforme: in a large prospective randomized Phase III trial  TTFields was compared with best standard care (including chemotherapy): TTFields  significantly improved median overall survival (OS) compared with standard  therapy (7.8 vs 6.1 months) for the patients treated per protocol. Importantly,  quality of life was also better in the TTFields group. The second indication was  a Phase II study in second-line non-small cell lung cancer, where TTFields was  administered concomitantly with pemetrexed. This combination resulted in an  excellent median OS of 13.8 months. Interestingly, the progression-free survival  (PFS) within the area of the TTFields was 28, however, outside the TTFields the  PFS was only 22 weeks. EXPERT OPINION: The proof of concept of TTFields has been well demonstrated in  the preclinical setting, and the clinical data seem promising in various tumor  types. The side effects of TTFields were minimal and in general consisted of  skin reaction to the electrodes. There are a number of ways in which TTFields  could be further evaluated, for example, in combination with chemotherapy, as a  maintenance treatment, or as a salvage therapy if radiotherapy or surgery is not  possible. While more clinical data are clearly needed, TTFields is an emerging  and promising novel treatment concept.', 'OBJECTIVE: To assess effectiveness of 5-aminolevulinic acid (5-ALA, Gliolan(®))  in patients treated for malignant glioma under typical daily practice conditions  in Spain, using complete resection rate (CR) and progression free survival at 6  months (PFS6). MATERIAL AND METHODS: Retrospective review of data from 18 neurosurgery  departments that were categorised as either using or not using 5-ALA. The study  included adult patients with suspected malignant gliomas for whom the intended  treatment plan included complete resection followed by radiotherapy and  chemotherapy with temozolomide. Postoperative MRI and clinical data representing  at least 6 months were required for inclusion. Rates of CR and PFS6 were  compared between patients with 5-ALA treatment and those without. RESULTS: The study included 251 evaluable cases. CR and PFS6 rates were  significantly higher in the group of patients treated surgically with 5-ALA: CR,  67% versus 45%, p=.000; PFS6 for patients with grade IV tumours, 69% versus 48%;  p=.002. The differences retained their significance and magnitude after  adjusting for all covariates including age, functional status, and whether  gliomas were located in eloquent areas. CONCLUSIONS: In this retrospective series, use of 5-ALA during habitual surgical  procedures in Spain was associated with a higher complete resection rate for  malignant glioma and increased PFS6 for grade iv glioma.']]]",Tumor-treating fields (TTFields) are effective for the treatment of recurrent glioblastoma and non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC).,"[{'Exact': array([-0.71470937, -1.42264199, -0.34758348,  8.63721092, -2.58455759,

Which properties of the mRNA does N6-methyladenosine (m6A) affect?,"[[['Methyltranscriptome is an exciting new area that studies the mechanisms and  functions of methylation in transcripts. The MethylTranscriptome DataBase  (MeT-DB, http://compgenomics.utsa.edu/methylation/) is the first comprehensive  resource for N6-methyladenosine (m(6)A) in mammalian transcriptome. It includes  a database that records publicaly available data sets from methylated RNA  immunoprecipitation sequencing (MeRIP-Seq), a recently developed technology for  interrogating m(6)A methyltranscriptome. MeT-DB includes ∼ 300 k m(6)A  methylation sites in 74 MeRIP-Seq samples from 22 different experimental  conditions predicted by exomePeak and MACS2 algorithms. To explore this rich  information, MeT-DB also provides a genome browser to query and visualize  context-specific m(6)A methylation under different conditions. MeT-DB also  includes the binding site data of microRNA, splicing factor and RNA binding  proteins in the browser window for comparison with m(6)A sites and for exploring  the potential functions of m(6)A. Analysis of differential m(6)A methylation and  the related differential gene expression under two conditions is also available  in the browser. A global perspective of the genome-wide distribution of m(6)A  methylation in all the data is provided in circular ideograms, which also act as  a navigation portal. The query results and the entire data set can be exported  to assist publication and additional analysis.', 'A large-scale analysis of human polyadenylation signals was carried out in  silico. The most canonical AAUAAA hexamer and its 11 single-nucleotide variants  that are most frequent in human genes were used to search for polyadenylation  signals in the terminal sequences. Out of 18,277 poly(A) sites that were  identified from 26,414 human genes, 82.5% of the sites were found to contain at  least one of these 12 hexamers as a polyadenylation signal within 40 nucleotides  upstream of the poly(A) site. The rest (17.5%) did not contain any of these  hexamers, which suggests the existence of yet unknown signals. A total of 20,347  terminal sequences in close proximity to 12 polyadenylation signals were  collected using modified EST clustering technique to establish a large-scale  database of polyadenylation signals. To characterize the 12 hexamers, the  locations of polyadenylation signals that were identified as ""authentic"" and the  uracil contents of the downstream region of the signal were examined. Based on  this analysis, the 11 variants of the canonical AAUAAA were identified as  possibly forming ""functional"" signals as AAUAAA. Moreover, the observed  frequency of 41.9% for AAUAAA was significantly lower than those of other  reports, suggesting that the non-canonical variants are more important in the  polyadenylation process than frequently recognized. Since the poly(A) sites  processed by those non-canonical variants have not been generally annotated in  major gene databases, it is important to determine whether the variant hexamers  could work as polyadenylation signals that may be responsible for generating  heterogeneity of mRNAs by alternative polyadenylation.', ""miRNAs and DNA methylation are both critical regulators of gene expression.  Aberration in miRNA expression or DNA methylation is a causal factor for  numerous pathological conditions. DNA methylation can inhibit the transcription  of miRNAs, just like coding genes, by methylating the CpG islands in the  promoter regions of miRNAs. Conversely, certain miRNAs can directly target DNA  methyltransferases and bring about their inhibition, thereby affecting the whole  genome methylation pattern. Recently, methylation patterns have also been  revealed in mRNA. Surprisingly, the two most commonly studied methylation states  in mRNA (m6A and m5C) are found to be enriched in 3'-UTRs (untranslated  regions), the target site for the majority of miRNAs. Whereas m5C is reported to  stabilise mRNA, m6A has a destabilising effect on mRNA. However, the effect of  mRNA methylation on its interaction with miRNAs is largely unexplored. The  review highlights the complex interplay between microRNA and methylation at DNA  and mRNA level."", 'It has been repeatedly shown that chronic stress changes dendrites, spines and  modulates expression of synaptic molecules. These effects all may impair  information transfer between neurons. The present study shows that chronic  stress also regulates expression of M6a, a glycoprotein which is localised in  axonal membranes. We have previously demonstrated that M6a is a component of  glutamatergic axons. The present data reveal that it is the splice variant  M6a-Ib, not M6a-Ia, which is strongly expressed in the brain. Chronic stress in  male rats (3 weeks daily restraint) has regional effects: quantitative in situ  hybridization demonstrated that M6a-Ib mRNA in dentate gyrus granule neurons and  in CA3 pyramidal neurons is downregulated, whereas M6a-Ib mRNA in the medial  prefrontal cortex is upregulated by chronic stress. This is the first study  showing that expression of an axonal membrane molecule is differentially  affected by stress in a region-dependent manner. Therefore, one may speculate  that diminished expression of the glycoprotein in the hippocampus leads to  altered output in the corresponding cortical projection areas. Enhanced M6a-Ib  expression in the medial prefrontal cortex (in areas prelimbic and infralimbic  cortex) might be interpreted as a compensatory mechanism in response to changes  in axonal projections from the hippocampus. Our findings provide evidence that  in addition to alterations in dendrites and spines chronic stress also changes  the integrity of axons and may thus impair information transfer even between  distant brain regions.', ""Cycloleucine, a competitive inhibitor of methionine transferase was used to  generate in vivo partially methylated mRNA in SV40-infected BSC-1 cells.  Cycloleucine at 0.5 mg/ml causes more than a 30% decrease in internal m6As of  late SV40 mRNA with only minor effect on the dimethyladenosine of the 5' caps  m7GpppmAm. After treatment with 2 and 5 mg/ml of cycloleucine, internal m6As  were reduced by 10- and 100-fold, respectively. The inhibition of BSC-1 mRNA  methylations paralleled that observed for late SV40 mRNAs. In cells exposed to 2  mg/ml cycloleucine production of late SV40 mRNA was inhibited by 80% whereas the  amount of SV40 nuclear RNA was only slightly reduced. Size fractionation of SV40  nuclear RNA from cycloleucine-treated cells revealed a loss of SV40 19 S RNA  with a corresponding increase of fragmented RNA sedimenting between 11 to 5 S,  so that the total amount of SV40 RNA in the nucleus was almost unchanged.  Analysis of viral transcription complexes from cells treated with cycloleucine  indicated that SV40 transcription was not affected by cycloleucine.  SV40-transformed cells, in contrast to BSC-1 cells, were able to process and  transport undermethylated RNA. When transformed cells were treated with 2 mg/ml  cycloleucine no changes in quantities or size of cytoplasmic and nuclear RNA  were detected. The data argues for a role of internal m6A moieties in modulating  the processing-linked transport of mRNA from the nucleus to the cytoplasm of  nontransformed cells. Transformed cells may escape these controls due to  structural alterations in their perinuclear regions."", 'The methylation of internal adenosine residues in eukaryotic mRNA, forming  N6-methyladenosine (m6A), is catalyzed by a complex multicomponent enzyme.  Previous studies suggested that m6A affects the efficiency of mRNA processing or  transport, although the mechanism by which this occurs is not known. As a step  toward better understanding the mechanism and function of this ubiquitous  posttranscriptional modification, we have shown that HeLa mRNA  (N6-adenosine)-methyltransferase requires at least two separate protein factors,  MT-A and MT-B, and MT-A contains the AdoMet binding site on a 70-kDa subunit  (MT-A70). MT-A70 was purified by conventional chromatography and  electrophoresis, and was microsequenced. The peptide sequence was used to design  a degenerate oligodeoxynucleotide that in turn was used to isolate the cDNA  clone coding for MT-A70 from a HeLa cDNA library. Recombinant MT-A70 was  expressed as a fusion protein in bacteria and was used to generate anti-MT-A70  antisera in rabbits. These antisera recognize MT-A70 in HeLa nuclear extracts by  western blot and are capable of depleting (N6-adenosine)-methyltransferase  activity from HeLa nuclear extract, confirming that MT-A70 is a critical subunit  of (N6-adenosine)-methyltransferase. Northern blot analysis reveals that MT-A70  mRNA is present in a wide variety of human tissues and may undergo alternative  splicing. MT-A70 cDNA probe hybridizes to a 2.0-kilobase (kb) polyadenylated RNA  isolated from HeLa cells, whereas it hybridizes to two predominant RNA species  (approximately 2.0 kb and 3.0 kb) using mRNA isolated from six different human  tissues. Analysis of the cDNA sequence indicates that it codes for a 580-amino  acid protein with a predicted MW = 65 kDa. The predicted protein contains  sequences similar to consensus methylation motifs I and II identified in  prokaryotic DNA (N6-adenosine)-methyltransferases, suggesting the functional  conservation of peptide motifs. MT-A70 also contains a long region of homology  to the yeast protein SPO8, which is involved in induction of sporulation by an  unknown mechanism.', 'Author information: (1)Broad Institute of MIT and Harvard, Cambridge, MA 02142, USA.

A new study published in Cell Research  reports novel functions implicating FTO in the regulation of mRNA alternative  splicing in the control of adipogenesis.', 'N6-methyladenosine (m6A) modification plays a critical role in mammalian  development. However, the role of m6A in the skeletal muscle development remains  largely unknown. Here, we report a global m6A modification pattern of goat  skeletal muscle at two key development stages and identified that the m6A  modification regulated the expression of the growth arrest and DNA  damage-inducible 45B (GADD45B) gene, which is\xa0involved in myogenic  differentiation. We showed that GADD45B expression increased during myoblast  differentiation, whereas the downregulation of GADD45B inhibits myogenic  differentiation and mitochondrial biogenesis. Moreover, the expression of  GADD45B regulates the expression of\xa0myogenic regulatory factors and peroxisome  proliferator-activated receptor gamma coactivator 1 alpha by activating the p38  mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) pathway. Conversely, the inactivation of  p38 MAPK abolished the GADD45B-mediated myogenic differentiation. Furthermore,  we found that the knockdown of fat mass and obesity-associated protein (FTO)  increases GADD45B m6A modification and decreases the stability of GADD45B mRNA,  which impairs myogenic differentiation. Our results indicate that the  FTO-mediated m6A modification in GADD45B mRNA drives skeletal muscle  differentiation by activating the p38 MAPK pathway, which provides a molecular  mechanism for the regulation of myogenesis via RNA methylation.', ""N6-Methyladenosine (m6A) residues, which are found internally in viral and  cellular mRNA populations at the sequences Apm6ApC and Gpm6ApC, have been  proposed to play a role in mRNA processing and transport. We have developed a  sensitive approach to analyze the level and location of m6A in specific purified  cellular mRNAs in an attempt to correlate m6A location with function.  Polyadenylylated mRNA is hybridized to cDNA clones representing the full size  mRNA under study or fragments of it, and the protected RNA is digested and  labeled with polynucleotide kinase in vitro. After enrichment for m6A with  anti-m6A antibody, the [32P]-pm6A is separated on TLC plates, and compared with  the total amount of radiolabeled nucleotides. Using this combination of in vitro  RNA labeling and antibody selection, we were able to detect m6A in purified  stable mRNAs that cannot be readily labeled in cells with greater sensitivity  than was possible by previous techniques. We applied this technique to bovine  prolactin mRNA and showed that this mRNA contains m6A. Moreover, all of the m6A  residues in this message are found within the 3' two-thirds of the molecule and  are highly concentrated (61%) within a sequence of 108 nucleotides at the 3'  noncoding region of the message.

Is arimoclomol a co-inducer of the heat shock response?,"[[['Arimoclomol is an investigational drug for amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS)  that amplifies heat shock protein gene expression during cell stress. The  objectives of the present study were to assess the safety, tolerability, and  pharmacokinetics of arimoclomol in ALS. Eighty-four participants with ALS  received arimoclomol at one of three oral doses (25, 50, or 100 mg three times  daily) or placebo. The primary outcome measure was safety and tolerability. A  subset of 44 participants provided serum and cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) samples  for pharmacokinetic analysis. Participants who completed 12 weeks of treatment  could enroll in a 6-month open-label study. Arimoclomol at doses up to 300  mg/day was well tolerated and safe. Arimoclomol resulted in dose-linear  pharmacologic exposures and the half-life did not change with continued  treatment. Arimoclomol CSF levels increased with dose. Arimoclomol was shown to  be safe, and it crosses the blood-brain barrier. Serum pharmacokinetic profiles  support dosing of three times per day. An efficacy study in ALS is planned.', 'Manipulation of the cellular stress response offers strategies to protect brain  cells from damage induced by ischemia and neurodegenerative diseases.  Overexpression of Hsp70 reduced ischemic injury in the mammalian brain.  Investigation of the domains within Hsp70 that confers ischemic neuroprotection  revealed the importance of the carboxyl-terminal domain. Arimoclomol, a  coinducer of heat shock proteins, delayed progression of amyotrophic lateral  sclerosis (ALS) in a mouse model in which motor neurons in the spinal cord and  motor cortex degenerate. Celastrol, a promising candidate as an agent to counter  neurodegenerative diseases, induced expression of a set of Hsps in  differentiated neurons grown in tissue culture. Heat shock ""preconditioning""  protected the nervous system at the functional level of the synapse and  selective overexpression of Hsp70 enhanced the level of synaptic protection.  Following hyperthermia, constitutively expressed Hsc70 increased in synapse-rich  areas of the brain where it associates with Hsp40 to form a complex that can  refold denatured proteins. Stress tolerance in neurons is not solely dependent  on their own Hsps but can be supplemented by Hsps from adjacent glial cells.  Hence, application of exogenous Hsps at neural injury sites is an effective  strategy to maintain neuronal viability.', 'The field of non-coding RNA (ncRNA) has expanded over the last decade following  the discoveries of several new classes of regulatory ncRNA. A growing amount of  evidence now indicates that ncRNAs are involved even in the most fundamental of  cellular processes. The heat shock response is no exception as ncRNAs are being  identified as integral components of this process. Although this area of  research is only in its infancy, this article focuses on several classes of  regulatory ncRNA (i.e., miRNA, lncRNA, and circRNA), while summarizing their  activities in mammalian heat shock. We also present an updated model integrating  the traditional heat shock response with the activities of regulatory ncRNA. Our  model expands on the mechanisms for efficient execution of the stress response,  while offering a more comprehensive summary of the major regulators and  responders in heat shock signaling. It is our hope that much of what is  discussed herein may help researchers in integrating the fields of heat shock  and ncRNA in mammals.', 'Amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) is a progressive neurodegenerative disorder  characterized by motoneuron degeneration, resulting in muscle paralysis and  death, typically within 1-5 years of diagnosis. Although the pathogenesis of ALS  remains unclear, there is evidence for the involvement of proteasome dysfunction  and heat shock proteins in the disease. We have previously shown that treatment  with a co-inducer of the heat shock response called arimoclomol is effective in  the SOD(G93A) mouse model of ALS, delaying disease progression and extending the  lifespan of SOD(G93A) mice (Kieran et al. 2004). However, this previous study  only examined the effects arimoclomol when treatment was initiated in pre- or  early symptomatic stages of the disease. Clearly, to be of benefit to the  majority of ALS patients, any therapy must be effective after symptom onset. In  order to establish whether post-symptomatic treatment with arimoclomol is  effective, in this study we carried out a systematic assessment of different  treatment regimes in SOD(G93A) mice. Treatment with arimoclomol from early (75  days) or late (90 days) symptomatic stages significantly improved muscle  function. Treatment from 75 days also significantly increased the lifespan of  SOD(G93A) mice, although treatment from 90 days has no significant effect on  lifespan. The mechanism of action of arimoclomol involves potentiation of the  heat shock response, and treatment with arimoclomol increased Hsp70 expression.  Interestingly, this up-regulation in Hsp70 was accompanied by a decrease in the  number of ubiquitin-positive aggregates in the spinal cord of treated SOD(G93A)  mice, suggesting that arimoclomol directly effects protein aggregation and  degradation.', 'Retinitis pigmentosa (RP) is a group of inherited diseases that cause blindness  due to the progressive death of rod and cone photoreceptors in the retina. There  are currently no effective treatments for RP. Inherited mutations in rhodopsin,  the light-sensing protein of rod photoreceptor cells, are the most common cause  of autosomal-dominant RP. The majority of mutations in rhodopsin, including the  common P23H substitution, lead to protein misfolding, which is a feature in many  neurodegenerative disorders. Previous studies have shown that upregulating  molecular chaperone expression can delay disease progression in models of  neurodegeneration. Here, we have explored the potential of the heat-shock  protein co-inducer arimoclomol to ameliorate rhodopsin RP. In a cell model of  P23H rod opsin RP, arimoclomol reduced P23H rod opsin aggregation and improved  viability of mutant rhodopsin-expressing cells. In P23H rhodopsin transgenic rat  models, pharmacological potentiation of the stress response with arimoclomol  improved electroretinogram responses and prolonged photoreceptor survival, as  assessed by measuring outer nuclear layer thickness in the retina. Furthermore,  treated animal retinae showed improved photoreceptor outer segment structure and  reduced rhodopsin aggregation compared with vehicle-treated controls. The  heat-shock response (HSR) was activated in P23H retinae, and this was enhanced  with arimoclomol treatment. Furthermore, the unfolded protein response (UPR),  which is induced in P23H transgenic rats, was also enhanced in the retinae of  arimoclomol-treated animals, suggesting that arimoclomol can potentiate the UPR  as well as the HSR. These data suggest that pharmacological enhancement of  cellular stress responses may be a potential treatment for rhodopsin RP and that  arimoclomol could benefit diseases where ER stress is a factor.', 'We undertook a longitudinal study of the histological and biochemical changes at  the neuromuscular junction (NMJ) in muscles of SOD1-G93A mice. We also assessed  these functions in mice treated with a known heat shock protein inducer,  arimoclomol. Tissue samples of treated and untreated mSOD mice were analysed for  AChE and ChAT enzyme activities as markers of neuromuscular function. Sections  of hindlimb muscles (TA, EDL and soleus) were also stained for succinate  dehydrogenase and silver cholinesterase activities as well as for  immunohistochemistry. Hsp70 levels were also measured from muscle samples using  ELISA. Results showed that denervation and nerve sprouting were present at  symptom onset in fast muscles, although slow muscles remained fully innervated.  Cholinergic enzyme activities were reduced prior to denervation and declined  further with disease progression. Reduction of endplate size, a slow to fast  shift in muscle phenotype was also observed. Treatment with arimoclomol delayed  the appearance of these changes, increased innervation, cholinergic enzyme  activities and endplate size and reversed muscle fibre transformation. These  beneficial effects of arimoclomol in muscles were accompanied by an increase in  Hsp70 expression. In conclusion, our results indicate that pharmacological  targeting of muscles at early stages of disease may be a successful strategy to  ameliorate disease progression in ALS.', '1. The effects of SR 33589 and amiodarone on the cardiac beta-adrenoceptor were  studied in vitro and after chronic treatment by means of  [125I]-(-)-iodocyanopindolol ([125I]-(-)-CYP) binding and measurement of  adenylate cyclase activity. 2. Binding of [125I]-(-)-CYP was inhibited in a  dose-dependent manner by SR 33589 (IC50=1.8 +/- 0.4 microM, nH=0.93 +/- 0.06)  and amiodarone (IC50=8.7 +/- 2.0 microM, nH=9.2 +/- 0.03). Saturation binding  experiments indicated a non-competitive interaction such that SR 33589 (1 and 3  microM) and amiodarone (5 and 10 microM) reduced the Bmax of [125I]-(-)-CYP  binding without any effect on the KD. Kinetic studies showed that the rate of  association of [125I]-(-)-CYP was unchanged while the rate of dissociation was  increased both in the presence of SR 33589 (10 microM) and amiodarone (30  microM).3. Under the same conditions, the receptor stimulated adenylate cyclase  activity was inhibited in a dose-dependent, but non-competitive manner, by SR  33589 (isoprenaline-, glucagon- and secretin-stimulated enzyme inhibited 50% at  6.8 +/- 0.6 microM, 31 +/- 10 microM and 12 +/- 3 microM, respectively) while  the basal, GTP- and GPP(NH)p-stimulated enzyme was inhibited by 5-10% and the  NaF and forskolin-stimulated enzyme by 50% at 500 microM. Amiodarone exhibited a  similar pattern of inhibition. 4. After chronic oral treatment (50, 100, 150 mg  kg(-1) per day, 14 days), both SR 33589 and amiodarone produced a dose-dependent  decrease in Bmax without any effect on KD as determined from [125I]-(-)-CYP  saturation experiments and a decrease of the isoprenaline- and  glucagon-stimulated adenylate cyclase activity without any effect on basal  enzyme activity or activity when stimulated by agents acting directly on  regulatory catalytic units. 5. Unlike amiodarone, SR 33589 does not contain  iodine substituents. Plasma levels of T3, T4, and rT3 were changed after SR  33589 treatment except a decrease in T4 level at the highest dose whilst the T4  T3 ratio and the level of rT3 were dose-dependently increased by amiodarone  treatment. 6. In vitro, SR 33589 and amiodarone were characterized as  non-competitive beta-adrenoceptor antagonists. Chronic treatment led to a  down-regulation of the beta-adrenoceptor; the down-regulation cannot be  attributed to an indirect effect mediated by the thyroid hormones. To reconcile  these opposing observations, we propose that SR 33589 and amiodarone interact  with the beta-adrenoceptor at a site close to the intracellular loops which are  involved in the coupling with Gs and contain the phosphorylable sites.', 'Sinodielide A (SA) is a naturally occurring guaianolide, which is isolated from  the root of Sinodielsia yunnanensis. This root, commonly found in Yunnan  province, is used in traditional Chinese medicine as an antipyretic, analgesic  and diaphoretic agent. A number of studies have reported that agents isolated  from a species of Umbelliferae (Apiaceae) have antitumor activities. We  previously reported, using combined treatments with this medicinal herb and  hyperthermia at various temperatures, an enhanced cytotoxicity in the human  prostate cancer androgen‑independent cell lines, PC3 and DU145, and analyzed the  related mechanisms. In the present study, we investigated the effects of  treatment with SA prior to hyperthermia on the thermosensitivity of DU145 cells,  and the mechanisms related to the induction of apoptosis and G(2)/M cell cycle  arrest via the activation of extracellular-regulated kinase (ERK)1/2, c-Jun  N-terminal kinase (JNK) mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) signaling  pathways, as well as the phosphoinositide 3-kinase (PI3K)/Akt signaling  pathways. Cells were exposed to hyperthermia alone (40-44˚C) or hyperthermia in  combination with SA. Lethal damage to cells treated with mild hyperthermia (40  or 42˚C) for up to 6 h was slight; however, hyperthermia in combination with SA  synergistically enhanced thermosensivity. Lethal damage to cells treated with  acute hyperthermia (43 or 44˚C) was more severe, but these effects were also  enhanced and were more significant by the combined treatment with SA. The  kinetics of apoptosis induction and cell cycle distribution were analyzed by  flow cytometry. In addition, the levels of ERK1/2, JNK and Akt were determined  by western blot analysis. The incidence of apoptotic cells after treatment with  SA (20.0 µM) at 37˚C for 4 h, hyperthermia (44˚C) alone for 30 min, and the  combination in sequence were examined. The sub-G1 division (%) in the diagram  obtained by flow cytometry was applied to that assay. The percentage of  apoptotic cells (10.53±5.02%) was higher at 48 h as compared to 0, 12 and 24 h  after treatment. The distribution of DU145 cells in the G2/M cell cycle phase  was markedly increased after 24 h of heating at 44˚C and after the combined  treatment with heating and SA. The phosphorylation of ERK1/2 was reduced  following treatment with heating and SA, while the levels of phosphorylated JNK  (p-JNK) were markedly increased immediately after heating at 44˚C and when  heating was combined with SA. By contrast, the levels of phosphorylated Akt  (p-Akt) were immediately increased only after heating at 44˚C. Thus, we  concluded that SA exerts its thermosensitizing effects on DU145 cells by  inhibiting the activation of the MAPK/ERK1/2 and PI3K/Akt signaling pathways.', 'Arimoclomol, an amplifier of heat shock protein expression involved in cellular  stress response, has emerged as a potential therapeutic candidate in amyotrophic  lateral sclerosis (ALS) in recent years. Treatment with arimoclomol was reported  to improve survival and muscle function in a mouse model of motor neuron  disease. Several single- and multiple-dose safety studies have been completed in  healthy control subjects. A 3-month Phase IIa study in people with ALS  demonstrated safety at dosages up to 300 mg/day and another study is currently  recruiting participants with familial ALS caused by mutations in the superoxide  dismutase gene. We review the rationale for testing arimoclomol in sporadic and  familial ALS in the context of available safety and pharmacokinetic data.  Published and unpublished literature relative to the drug in the past two  decades is discussed. The current review attempts to bring together our existing  understanding of the actions of arimoclomol with the disease profile of ALS. The  pharmacological profile of arimoclomol and the available preclinical data make  it a promising therapeutic possibility in ALS.', 'Lysosomal storage diseases (LSDs) often manifest with severe systemic and  central nervous system (CNS) symptoms. The existing treatment options are  limited and have no or only modest efficacy against neurological manifestations  of disease. We demonstrate that recombinant human heat shock protein 70 (HSP70)  improves the binding of several sphingolipid-degrading enzymes to their  essential cofactor bis(monoacyl)glycerophosphate in vitro. HSP70 treatment  reversed lysosomal pathology in primary fibroblasts from 14 patients with eight  different LSDs. HSP70 penetrated effectively into murine tissues including the  CNS and inhibited glycosphingolipid accumulation in murine models of Fabry  disease (Gla(-/-)), Sandhoff disease (Hexb(-/-)), and Niemann-Pick disease type  C (Npc1(-/-)) and attenuated a wide spectrum of disease-associated neurological  symptoms in Hexb(-/-) and Npc1(-/-) mice. Oral administration of arimoclomol, a  small-molecule coinducer of HSPs that is currently in clinical trials for  Niemann-Pick disease type C (NPC), recapitulated the effects of recombinant  human HSP70, suggesting that heat shock protein-based therapies merit clinical  evaluation for treating LSDs.']]]","Yes, arimoclomol is described as a co-inducer of the heat shock response.","[{'Exact': array([-0.40090505,  1.60224141, -0.30042555,  3.07042696,  2.45549973,

What is 2d 4d ratio in athletes.,"[[['OBJECTIVES: Digit ratio, especially second-to-fourth digit ratio (2D:4D) is  established in utero and is positively correlated with oestrogen in men and  women. It is a putative biomarker for prenatal hormone exposure and may  represent an individual predisposition to certain diseases (e.g., breast  cancer). The aim of the present study is to investigate whether there is a link  between digit ratio (2D:4D) and breast cancer in Chinese populations. METHODS: The controls we chose were healthy subjects-age and -sex matched to the  patients diagnosed with breast cancer. Photocopies of the two hands of 218 women  (controls: 109; patients: 109) were collected. Left hand, right hand, mean hand,  and right minus left 2D:4D (Dr-l ) were analyzed. RESULTS: The patients with breast cancer presented significantly higher 2D:4D  than controls (left: P < 0.01; right: P < 0.05; mean: P < 0.05). The mean values  of 2D:4D on the left hand were significantly higher than those on the right hand  in the two groups, respectively (controls: P < 0.05; patients: P ≤ 0.01). In  patients, there was a significantly negative correlation between 2D:4D (left  hand: P < 0.01; right hand, mean: P < 0.05) and the presented age with breast  cancer, but no association between Dr-l and age of presented disease. CONCLUSIONS: Digit ratio (2D:4D) may correlate with the increased risk of breast  cancer.', 'Congenital adrenal hyperplasia (CAH) due to 21-hydroxylase deficiency results in  excessive androgen exposure in the gestational period and various degrees of  masculinization of the external genitalia in female foetuses. Intrauterine  gonadal steroids are not only essential for the development of the genital  organs but also affect some other extragenital organ development. The second to  fourth digit (2D/4D) ratio shows a sexually dimorphic pattern with longer fourth  digit from second digit in men compared to women. A low 2D/4D ratio is  associated with high sperm count, testosterone levels and reproductive success  in men. A high 2D/4D ratio is associated with high oestrogen levels in women.  Second and fourth digit ratio has also found to be correlated with sexual  orientation, left hand preference autism and some adult onset diseases such as  breast cancer and myocardial infarction. We found lower 2D/4D ratio in female  patients with 21-hydroxylase deficiency compared to healthy girls (p=0.000) and  equal 2D/4D ratio for female patients when compared to male controls. Male  patients with 21-hydroxylase deficiency had significantly lower 2D/4D ratio than  female and male controls in the right hand. Healthy boys had lower 2D/4D ratio  than healthy girls. It is concluded that 2D/4D ratio established by intrauterine  androgen levels influences the sexually dimorphic digit pattern.', ""The relative length of the second and fourth digits (2D:4D) is thought to be  negatively related to prenatal testosterone and positively related to prenatal  estrogen. Low 2D:4D has been linked to various measures of performance in a  range of sports (e.g., soccer, rugby). In this study, we consider the  relationship between 2D:4D and performance among male surfers. Our sample  comprised 46 competitors in the Men's 5-star Professional World Qualifying  Series surfing competition in Newquay, United Kingdom, in 2009. Three  experienced surfing coaches rated the participants for overall surfing ability.  The coach's ratings were significantly correlated with one another and an  overall measure of surfing performance was obtained by calculating the mean of  the 3 ratings. In addition, the final placing of the Newquay competition was  used as an additional performance measure. Mean 2D:4D (SD) was as follows: right  0.994 (0.023) and left 0.976 (0.028). We found that right 2D:4D (but not left  2D:4D or right-left 2D:4D) was significantly negatively correlated with coaches'  ratings (r(s) = 0.58) and the competition result (r(s) = 0.30). It appears that  in line with other sports that low right 2D:4D (high prenatal testosterone and  low prenatal estrogen) correlates to high surfing ability in men."", 'Reliable data are scanty on the incidence of chronic diseases and life  expectancy (LE) of highly trained athletes. We therefore studied Finnish male  world class athletes to estimate the LE of athletes. Finnish team members in the  Olympic games, World or European championships or intercountry competitions  during 1920-1965 in track and field athletics, cross-country skiing, soccer, ice  hockey, basketball, boxing, wrestling, weight lifting, and shooting were  included (N = 2613 men). The reference cohort, 1712 men, was selected from the  Finnish Defence Forces conscription register matched on age and area of  residence. All referents were classified completely healthy at the time of  induction to military service. The stratified Kaplan-Meier product limit method  and the Cox proportional hazards model were used to estimate the life  expectancies and the mortality odds ratios (OR) and their confidence limits. The  mean LE adjusted for occupational group, marital status, and the age at entry to  the cohort (and its 95% confidence limits) was in endurance sports (long  distance running and cross-country skiing) 75.6 (73.6, 77.5) yr; in team games  (soccer, ice hockey, basketball, as well as jumpers and short-distance runners  from track and field (73.9 (72.7, 75.1) yr; in power sports (boxing, wrestling,  weight lifting, and throwers from field athletics) 71.5 (70.4, 72.2) yr; and in  the reference group 69.9 (69.0, 70.9) yr. The increased mean life expectancies  were mainly explained by decreased cardiovascular mortality (endurance sports  mortality odds ratio OR = 0.49 (95% CL 0.26, 0.93), team sports OR = 0.61 (0.41,  0.92) compared with referents). For maximum life span no differences between the  groups were observed.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)', ""BACKGROUND: Ratio of second and fourth digit (2D:4D) is known to be germane in  analyzing utero concentrations of testosterone and estrogen in human and other  vertebrates. 2D:4D had been linked to several traits like athletes' abilities,  reproductive success, risk of cancer and cardiovascular disease (CVD). Metabolic  syndrome (MetS) is a clustering of several cardiovascular risk factors. Waist  circumference (WC), neck circumference (NC), body mass index (BMI) and  waist-to-height ratio (WHtR) are important in measuring MetS. This study  investigated sexual dimorphism in 2D:4D and its relationship with MetS indices  and CVD factors among adult residing in Ilorin, North central Nigeria. MATERIALS AND METHODS: This is a cross-sectional, stratified multi-staged  sampling study. Participants residing in different neighborhoods were visited at  home where finger lengths and anthropometric traits were measured. Participants  include 801 healthy adults aged 18-44 years (56% male) who had been living in  the area for more than 3 years. RESULTS: Males showed significantly lower 2D:4D than females (unpaired t-test; t  [699] = 11.49, P = 0.001). A significant positive correlation was observed in  MetS markers and 2D:4D. WHtR showed the highest correlation with 2D:4D in male  (r = 0.461, P ≤ 0.001) and female (r = 0.408, P ≤ 0.001) when compared with BMI,  NC and WC. All positive correlations recorded in this study were high in male  and right hand. CONCLUSION: Our results showed that 2D:4D is sexual dimorphic and right hand  2D:4D as a predictor of MetS is better. We concluded that 2D:4D is a proxy for  MetS and CVD risk factors in Ilorin."", '""Athlete\'s heart"" is characterized by an increase in ventricular chamber sizes  and myocardial mass (MM), and is mainly observed in endurance athletes. At  present, it remains unclear whether cardiac adaptations in long-distance runners  differ from those in triathletes. Twenty male triathletes (mean age 38.7 ± 6.2  years) and 20 male marathon runners (mean age 44.1 ± 7.9) underwent cardiac  magnetic resonance imaging to calculate left and right ventricular end-diastolic  volume (EDV), end-systolic volume (ESV), stroke volume (SV), ejection fraction  (EF), and MM. Late-enhancement (LE) imaging was used to exclude structural  alterations or myocardial scarring. EDV, ESV, SV, and EF for the left and right  ventricles, as well as MM, did not differ between long-distance runners and  triathletes, although the weekly training volume was significantly higher in  triathletes (17.05 vs 9.95 h/week, P < 0.0001). There was a significant  correlation between weekly training volume and right and left EDV, right and  left ESV as well as MM within the study group. Myocardial LE was absent in all  athletes. Highly trained male long-distance runners and triathletes have  comparable cardiac parameters. However, the extent of physical training seems to  be associated with the degree of cardiac adaptation in endurance athletes. The  absence of LE supports the idea that athlete\'s heart is a nonpathological  adaptation of the cardiovascular system.', 'BACKGROUND: To determine the 2D:4D ratio in elite Indian male kabaddi players  and compare them with non-athletes. OBJECTIVES: Our study was undertaken to find out a possible relation between  digit ratio and sporting ability of male kabaddi players. This study also gives  an insight into the possible ethnic differences between Indian sports personnel  and other populations. PATIENTS AND METHODS: Both right and left hands of 33 male kabaddi players  attending training camp at the Bangalore regional centre of Sports Authority of  India were scanned. Lengths of second and fourth digits were measured and their  ratio calculated. Age, weight, height and body mass index matched subjects (25  males) who did not participate in any sports formed the control group. RESULTS: A highly significant difference was found in 2D:4D ratios of both the  hands with Kabaddi players having a lower ratio compared to their controls.  There was no statistically significant difference in 2D:4D (Δ r-l) between  Kabaddi players and controls. CONCLUSIONS: Kabaddi is an intermediate sport not requiring a high level of  endurance but at the same time requires masculine traits because of combating  nature of the game. 2D:4D ratios can be used as reliable additional criteria  when screening for prospective players to be inducted into the team.', ""OBJECTIVES: Athlete's heart represents a structural and functional adaptation to  regular endurance exercise. BACKGROUND: While left ventricular (LV) hypertrophy of the athlete's heart has  been examined in many studies, the extent of right ventricular (RV) hypertrophy  is still uncertain because of its complex shape and trabecular structure. To  examine RV hypertrophy, we used magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) and  hypothesized that athlete's heart is characterized by similar LV and RV  hypertrophy. METHODS: The LV and RV mass, volume, and function in 21 male endurance athletes  (A) (27 +/- 4 years; 70 +/- 8 kg; 178 +/- 7 cm; maximal oxygen uptake  [VO(2)max]: 68 +/- 5 ml/min per kg) and 21 pair-matched untrained control  subjects (C) (26 +/- 3 years; 71 +/- 9 kg; 178 +/- 6 cm; VO(2)max: 42 +/- 6  ml/min per kg) were analyzed by MRI (Magnetom Vision 1.5T, Siemens, Erlangen,  Germany). RESULTS: Left ventricular masses: (A: 200 +/- 20 g; C: 148 +/- 17 g) and RV  masses (A: 77 +/- 10 g; C: 56 +/- 8 g) differed significantly between the groups  (p < 0.001). The LV and RV end-diastolic volumes (EDV) (LV-EDV 167 +/- 28 ml  [A]; 125 +/- 16 ml [C]; RV-EDV 160 +/- 26 ml [A]; 128 +/- 10 ml [C]), and stroke  volumes (SV) (LV-SV: 99 +/- 18 ml [A], 74 +/- 11 ml [C]; RV-SV: 102 +/- 18 ml  [A], 79 +/- 8 ml [C]) were significantly different between the athletes and  control subjects (p < 0.001), whereas ejection fractions (EF) (LV-EF: 59 +/- 3%  [A]; 59 +/- 6% [C]; RV-EF: 63 +/- 3% [A], 62 +/- 3% [C]) and LV-to-RV ratios  were similar for both groups (LV-to-RV mass: 2.6 +/- 0.2 [A], 2.6 +/- 0.3 [C];  LV-to-RV EDV: 1.05 +/- 0.14 [A], 0.99 +/- 0.14 [C]; LV-to-RV SV: 0.98 +/- 0.17  [A], 0.95 +/- 0.17 [C]; LV-to-RV EF: 0.93 +/- 0.07 [A], 0.96 +/- 0.10 [C]). CONCLUSIONS: Regular and extensive endurance training results in similar changes  in LV and RV mass, volume, and function in endurance athletes. This leads to the  conclusion that the athlete's heart is a balanced enlarged heart."", 'Research particularly focusing on male athletes and popular sports (running and  soccer) suggests associations of lower (masculinized) second-to-fourth digit  ratio (2D:4D), a putative marker of prenatal androgen action, with better sports  performance. Studies focusing on women, non-mainstream sports, or controlling  for covariates relevant for sporting success are still sparse. This study  examined associations between 2D:4D and performance of both male and female  athletes active in fencing (a non-mainstream sport dominated by male  participants), while controlling for covariates. National fencing rankings and  2D:4D of 58 male and 41 female Austrian tournament fencers (mean age 24 years)  were correlated. Among female, but not male, fencers, lower 2D:4D was related to  better national fencing rankings. 2D:4D still accounted for incremental variance  (12%) in fencing success, when the effects of salient performance factors (age,  body mass index, years of fencing, training intensity, and the personality  variables achievement, control, harm avoidance, and social potency) were  controlled for (totaling 35% attributable variance). Athletes active in the most  aggressive form (the sabre) had lower 2D:4D than those active in the other forms  (épée and foil fencing). Sporting success in adult life might be partly  prenatally programmed via long-lasting extragenital effects of testosterone.', ""The relative length of the second and fourth digits (2D:4D) is a putative marker  for prenatal testosterone. Low 2D:4D has been reported to correlate with high  performance in sport in general. Here, for the first time, we examine the  relationship between 2D:4D and performance in elite rugby players. The 44  players (28 forwards, 16 backs) were drawn from the Ospreys Rugby Union Club and  44 age-matched controls. The measures of performance comprised age-adjusted  number of international performances (caps) for Wales, a comparison of coaches'  first-choice League team with others, and the number of tries scored by backs in  club matches. Compared with controls, players were larger and had lower 2D:4D  for the right and left hand. With regard to number of caps, players with low  2D:4D in their right hand and low right 2D:4D compared with their left  (right\xa0-\xa0left 2D:4D difference) had high numbers of caps. First-choice players  did not differ significantly from second-choice players in their 2D:4D but they  did have a lower right\xa0-\xa0left 2D:4D difference than second-choice players. Low  right 2D:4D and low right\xa0-\xa0left 2D:4D difference were significantly linked with  large numbers of tries. We conclude that low right 2D:4D and low right\xa0-\xa0left  2D:4D difference are predictors of high rugby performance.""]]]","The 2D:4D ratio is lower in athletes, particularly male athletes, compared to non-athletes. Lower 2D:4D ratios have been associated with better sports performance, especially in endurance and combat sports. In male athletes, a lower 2D:4D ratio is linked to higher performance in sports like soccer, rugby, and fencing. Female athletes show a trend towards lower 2D:4D ratios as well, though the evidence is less consistent.","[{'Exact': array([ 4.26466171,  4.60008146, 15.37712525, -3.82125628,  9.16142197,

Which is the substrate of the haspin kinase during mitosis?,"[[['Aurora B is a component of the chromosomal passenger complex (CPC) required for  correct spindle-kinetochore attachments during chromosome segregation and for  cytokinesis. The chromatin factors that recruit the CPC to centromeres are  unknown, however. Here we show that phosphorylation of histone H3 threonine 3  (H3T3ph) by Haspin is necessary for CPC accumulation at centromeres and that the  CPC subunit Survivin binds directly to H3T3ph. A nonbinding Survivin-D70A/D71A  mutant does not support centromeric CPC concentration, and both Haspin depletion  and Survivin-D70A/D71A mutation diminish centromere localization of the kinesin  MCAK and the mitotic checkpoint response to taxol. Survivin-D70A/D71A mutation  and microinjection of H3T3ph-specific antibody both compromise centromeric  Aurora B functions but do not prevent cytokinesis. Therefore, H3T3ph generated  by Haspin positions the CPC at centromeres to regulate selected targets of  Aurora B during mitosis.', 'Haspin/Gsg2 is a kinase that phosphorylates histone H3 at Thr-3 (H3T3ph) during  mitosis. Its depletion by RNA interference results in failure of chromosome  alignment and a block in mitosis. Haspin, therefore, is a novel target for  development of antimitotic agents. We report the development of a  high-throughput time-resolved fluorescence resonance energy transfer (TR-FRET)  kinase assay for haspin. Histone H3 peptide was used as a substrate, and a  europium-labeled H3T3ph phosphospecific monoclonal antibody was used to detect  phosphorylation. A library of 137632 small molecules was screened at K(m)  concentrations of ATP and peptide to allow identification of diverse inhibitor  types. Reconfirmation of hits and IC( 50) determinations were carried out with  the TR-FRET assay and by a radiometric assay using recombinant histone H3 as the  substrate. A preliminary assessment of specificity was made by testing  inhibition of 2 unrelated kinases. EC( 50) values in cells were determined using  a cell-based ELISA of H3T3ph. Five compounds were selected as leads based on  potency and chemical structure considerations. These leads form the basis for  the development of specific inhibitors of haspin that will have clear utility in  basic research and possible use as starting points for development of  antimitotic anticancer therapeutics.', 'The approval of histone deacetylase inhibitors for treatment of lymphoma  subtypes has positioned histone modifications as potential targets for the  development of new classes of anticancer drugs. Histones also undergo  phosphorylation events, and Haspin is a protein kinase the only known target of  which is phosphorylation of histone H3 at Thr3 residue (H3T3ph), which is  necessary for mitosis progression. Mitotic kinases can be blocked by small drugs  and several clinical trials are underway with these agents. As occurs with  Aurora kinase inhibitors, Haspin might be an optimal candidate for the  pharmacological development of these compounds. A high-throughput screening for  Haspin inhibitors identified the CHR-6494 compound as being one promising such  agent. We demonstrate that CHR-6494 reduces H3T3ph levels in a dose-dependent  manner and causes a mitotic catastrophe characterized by metaphase misalignment,  spindle abnormalities and centrosome amplification. From the cellular  standpoint, the identified small-molecule Haspin inhibitor causes arrest in G2/M  and subsequently apoptosis. Importantly, ex vivo assays also demonstrate its  anti-angiogenetic features; in vivo, it shows antitumor potential in xenografted  nude mice without any observed toxicity. Thus, CHR-6494 is a first-in-class  Haspin inhibitor with a wide spectrum of anticancer effects that merits further  preclinical research as a new member of the family of mitotic kinase inhibitors.', 'New evidence from three separate laboratories, published recently in Science,  has shown that centromere positioning of the CPC (chromosomal passenger complex)  during early mitosis is achieved through direct interaction between the CPP  (chromosomal passenger protein) survivin and histone H3. In essence, an acidic  pocket in the BIR (baculovirus inhibitor of apoptosis repeat) domain of survivin  binds to the NH2 tail of histone H3 specifically when it is phosphorylated at  threonine 3, a mark that is placed by the mitotic kinase, haspin. These data are  significant, as they describe a fundamental mechanism, conserved throughout  eukaryotes, which is essential for chromosome biorientation and the maintenance  of genome stability during mitosis.', 'The mitosis-specific phosphorylation of histone H3 at Thr3 (H3T3ph) plays an  important role in chromosome segregation by recruiting Aurora B. H3T3  phosphorylation is catalyzed by Haspin, an atypical protein kinase whose kinase  domain is intrinsically active without phosphorylation at the activation loop.  Here, we report the molecular basis for Haspin inhibition during interphase and  its reactivation in M phase. We identify a conserved basic segment that  autoinhibits Haspin during interphase. This autoinhibition is neutralized when  Cdk1 phosphorylates the N terminus of Haspin in order to recruit Polo-like  kinase (Plk1/Plx1), which, in turn, further phosphorylates multiple sites at the  Haspin N terminus. Although Plx1, and not Aurora B, is critical for H3T3  phosphorylation in Xenopus egg extracts, Plk1 and Aurora B both promote this  modification in human cells. Thus, M phase-specific H3T3 phosphorylation is  governed by the combinatorial action of mitotic kinases that neutralizes Haspin  autoinhibition through a mechanism dependent on multisite phosphorylation.', 'Successful partitioning of chromosomes in mitosis relies on the bipolar  attachment of sister chromatids at metaphase. For this biorientation, the  chromosomal passenger complex (CPC), composed of catalytic kinase Aurora B and  regulatory components (INCENP, Survivin, and Borealin), must be localized at the  center of paired kinetochores, the site called the inner centromere. It is  largely unknown what defines the inner centromere and how the CPC is targeted to  this site. Recent studies point out that the shugoshin protein (SGO), originally  identified as a cohesin protector, also acts as a conserved centromeric adapter  of the CPC. Phosphorylation of the CPC by Cdk1 promotes direct binding with  shugoshin, thus explaining how the CPC is targeted to the centromere in a timely  manner at prometaphase during the cell cycle. Moreover, the phosphorylation of  histone H3 threonine 3 (H3-pT3) mediated by Haspin cooperates with Bub1-mediated  H2A-S121 phosphorylation in targeting the CPC to the inner centromere. H3-pT3  promotes nucleosome binding of Survivin, whereas H2A-pS121 facilitates the  binding of shugoshin. Haspin colocalizes with cohesin by associating with Pds5,  a cohesin-binding protein, and Bub1 localizes at kinetochores. Thus, the inner  centromere is defined by the spatial intersection of two histone marks mediated  by cohesin- and kinetochore-associated kinases.', 'Haspin is a serine/threonine kinase that phosphorylates Thr-3 of histone H3 in  mitosis that has emerged as a possible cancer therapeutic target. High  throughput screening of approximately 140,000 compounds identified the  beta-carbolines harmine and harmol as moderately potent haspin kinase  inhibitors. Based on information obtained from a structure-activity relationship  study previously conducted for an acridine series of haspin inhibitors in  conjunction with in silico docking using a recently disclosed crystal structure  of the kinase, harmine analogs were designed that resulted in significantly  increased haspin kinase inhibitory potency. The harmine derivatives also  demonstrated less activity towards DYRK2 compared to the acridine series. In  vitro mouse liver microsome stability and kinase profiling of a representative  member of the harmine series (42, LDN-211898) are also presented.', 'Aurora B is a component of the chromosomal passenger complex (CPC) required for  correct spindle-kinetochore attachments during chromosome segregation and for  cytokinesis. The chromatin factors that recruit the CPC to centromeres are  unknown, however. Here we show that phosphorylation of histone H3 threonine 3  (H3T3ph) by Haspin is necessary for CPC accumulation at centromeres and that the  CPC subunit Survivin binds directly to H3T3ph. A nonbinding Survivin-D70A/D71A  mutant does not support centromeric CPC concentration, and both Haspin depletion  and Survivin-D70A/D71A mutation diminish centromere localization of the kinesin  MCAK and the mitotic checkpoint response to taxol. Survivin-D70A/D71A mutation  and microinjection of H3T3ph-specific antibody both compromise centromeric  Aurora B functions but do not prevent cytokinesis. Therefore, H3T3ph generated  by Haspin positions the CPC at centromeres to regulate selected targets of  Aurora B during mitosis.', 'Aurora B is the catalytic subunit of the chromosomal passenger complex (CPC),  which coordinates mitotic processes through phosphorylation of key regulatory  proteins. In prometaphase, the CPC is enriched at the centromeres to regulate  the spindle checkpoint and kinetochore-microtubule interactions. Centromeric CPC  binds to histone H3 that is phosphorylated at T3 (H3T3ph) by Aurora B-stimulated  Haspin. PP1/Repo-Man acts antagonistically to Haspin and dephosphorylates H3T3ph  at the chromosome arms but is somehow prevented from causing a net  dephosphorylation of centromeric H3T3ph during prometaphase. Here, we show that  Aurora B phosphorylates Repo-Man at S893, preventing its recruitment by  histones. We also identify PP2A as a mitotic interactor of Repo-Man that  dephosphorylates S893 and thereby promotes the targeting of Repo-Man to  chromosomes and the dephosphorylation of H3T3ph by PP1. Thus,  Repo-Man-associated PP1 and PP2A collaborate to oppose the chromosomal targeting  of Aurora B. We propose that the reciprocal feedback regulation of Haspin and  Repo-Man by Aurora B generates a robust bistable response that culminates in the  centromeric targeting of the CPC during prometaphase.', 'A hallmark of mitosis is the appearance of high levels of histone  phosphorylation, yet the roles of these modifications remain largely unknown.  Here, we demonstrate that histone H3 phosphorylated at threonine 3 is directly  recognized by an evolutionarily conserved binding pocket in the BIR domain of  Survivin, which is a member of the chromosomal passenger complex (CPC). This  binding mediates recruitment of the CPC to chromosomes and the resulting  activation of its kinase subunit Aurora B. Consistently, modulation of the  kinase activity of Haspin, which phosphorylates H3T3, leads to defects in the  Aurora B-dependent processes of spindle assembly and inhibition of nuclear  reformation. These findings establish a direct cellular role for mitotic histone  H3T3 phosphorylation, which is read and translated by the CPC to ensure accurate  cell division.']]]",The substrate of the Haspin kinase during mitosis is histone H3 phosphorylated at threonine 3 (H3T3ph).,"[{'Exact': array([ 8.8195406 , -0.51009694,  2.94012584,  3.05622299,  1.28395095,

What is the importance of Janus Kinases in dermatology?,"[[['BACKGROUND: New therapeutic options are needed for patients with psoriasis.  Tofacitinib, an oral Janus kinase inhibitor, is being investigated as a  treatment for moderate-to-severe chronic plaque psoriasis. In this study, we  aimed to compare two tofacitinib doses with high-dose etanercept or placebo in  this patient population. METHODS: In this phase 3, randomised, multicentre, double-dummy,  placebo-controlled, 12-week, non-inferiority trial, adult patients with chronic  stable plaque psoriasis (for ≥12 months) who were candidates for systemic or  phototherapy and had a Psoriasis Area and Severity Index (PASI) score of 12 or  higher and a Physician\'s Global Assessment (PGA) of moderate or severe, and had  failed to respond to, had a contraindication to, or were intolerant to at least  one conventional systemic therapy, were enrolled from 122 investigational  dermatology centres worldwide. Eligible patients were randomly assigned in a  3:3:3:1 ratio to receive tofacitinib 5 mg or 10 mg twice daily at about 12 h  intervals, etanercept 50 mg subcutaneously twice weekly at about 3-4 day  intervals, or placebo. Randomisation was done by a computer-generated  randomisation schedule, and all patients and study personnel were masked to  treatment assignment. The co-primary endpoints were the proportion of patients  at week 12 with at least a 75% reduction in the PASI score from baseline (PASI75  response) and the proportion of patients achieving a PGA score of ""clear"" or  ""almost clear"" (PGA response), analysed in the full analysis set (all patients  who were randomised and received at least one dose of study drug). This study is  registered with ClinicalTrials.gov, number NCT01241591. FINDINGS: Between Nov 29, 2010, and Sept 13, 2012, we enrolled 1106 eligible  adult patients with chronic plaque psoriasis and randomly assigned them to the  four treatment groups (330 to tofacitinib 5 mg twice daily, 332 to tofacitinib  10 mg twice daily, 336 to etanercept 50 mg twice weekly, and 108 to placebo). Of  these patients, 1101 actually received their assigned study medication (329 in  the tofactinib 5 mg group, 330 in the tofacitinib 10 mg group, 335 in the  etanercept group, and 107 in the placebo group). At week 12, PASI75 responses  were recorded in 130 (39·5%) of 329 patients in the tofacitinib 5 mg group, 210  (63·6%) of 330 in the tofacitinib 10 mg group, 197 (58·8%) of 335 in the  etanercept group, and six (5·6%) of 107 in the placebo group. A PGA response was  achieved by 155 (47·1%) of 329 patients in the tofacitinib 5 mg group, 225  (68·2%) of 330 in the tofacitinib 10 mg group, 222 (66·3%) of 335 in the  etanercept group, and 16 (15·0%) of 107 in the placebo group. The rate of  adverse events was similar across the four groups, with serious adverse events  occurring in seven (2%) of 329 patients in the tofacitinib 5 mg group, five (2%)  of 330 in the tofacitinib 10 mg group, seven (2%) of 335 in the etanercept  group, and two (2%) of 107 in the placebo group. Three (1%) of 329 patients in  the tofacitinib 5 mg group, ten (3%) of 330 in the tofacitinib 10 mg group, 11  (3%) of 335 in the etanercept group, and four (4%) of 107 patients in the  placebo group discontinued their assigned treatment because of adverse events. INTERPRETATION: In patients with moderate-to-severe plaque psoriasis, the 10 mg  twice daily dose of tofacitinib was non-inferior to etanercept 50 mg twice  weekly and was superior to placebo, but the 5 mg twice daily dose did not show  non-inferiority to etanercept 50 mg twice weekly. The adverse event rates over  12 weeks were similar for tofacitinib and etanercept. This study indicates that  in the future tofacitinib could provide a convenient and well-tolerated  therapeutic option for patients with moderate-to-severe plaque psoriasis. FUNDING: Pfizer Inc.', ""BACKGROUND: Psoriasis is a chronic, inflammatory skin disease with a significant  impact on health-related quality of life (HRQoL). Tofacitinib (CP-690,550) is a  novel, oral Janus kinase inhibitor that is being investigated as a targeted  immunomodulator. OBJECTIVE: This Phase 2b study assessed three tofacitinib dosage regimens vs.  placebo to characterize the efficacy and safety of tofacitinib in patients with  moderate-to-severe chronic plaque psoriasis. We report the patient-reported  outcome (PRO) data. METHODS: A total of 197 patients were randomized to tofacitinib 2, 5, 15\xa0mg  twice daily or placebo for 12\xa0weeks. Six PRO questionnaires were completed  during the study: Dermatology Life Quality Index, Itch Severity Score (ISS),  Short Form-36 questionnaire, version 2 (SF-36), Pain/Discomfort Assessment  (PDA), Patient Satisfaction with Study Medication (PSSM) item and Patient Global  Assessment of psoriasis. RESULTS: Treatment with tofacitinib resulted in significant, dose-dependent  improvements in several PROs vs. placebo from week 2 onwards. At week 12, least  squares mean changes from baseline for Dermatology life quality index, ISS and  SF-36 mental component scores were significantly greater for all active drug  arms vs. placebo (P\xa0<\xa00.05), and significantly greater for tofacitinib 5 and 15  mg for SF-36 physical component scores vs. placebo (P\xa0<\xa00.05). At week 12, all  dose groups had significantly greater numbers of patients reporting 'Clear' or  'Almost clear' on the PtGA vs. placebo. CONCLUSION: In patients with moderate-to-severe chronic plaque psoriasis,  short-term (12-week) treatment with oral twice-daily tofacitinib improves HRQoL  outcomes and patient assessment of disease severity and symptoms, with an early  onset noted."", 'The primary cilium is essential for skin morphogenesis through regulating the  Notch, Wnt, and hedgehog signaling pathways. Prior studies on the functions of  primary cilia in the skin were based on the investigations of genes that are  essential for cilium formation. However, none of these ciliogenic genes has been  linked to ciliopathy, a group of disorders caused by abnormal formation or  function of cilia. To determine whether there is a genetic and molecular link  between ciliopathies and skin morphogenesis, we investigated the role of  RPGRIP1L, a gene mutated in Joubert (JBTS) and Meckel (MKS) syndromes, two  severe forms of ciliopathy, in the context of skin development. We found that  RPGRIP1L is essential for hair follicle morphogenesis. Specifically, disrupting  the Rpgrip1l gene in mice resulted in reduced proliferation and differentiation  of follicular keratinocytes, leading to hair follicle developmental defects.  These defects were associated with significantly decreased primary cilium  formation and attenuated hedgehog signaling. In contrast, we found that hair  follicle induction and polarization and the development of interfollicular  epidermis were unaffected. This study indicates that RPGRIP1L, a ciliopathy  gene, is essential for hair follicle morphogenesis likely through regulating  primary cilia formation and the hedgehog signaling pathway.', 'BACKGROUND: Length and intensity of signal transduction via cytokine receptors  is precisely regulated. Degradation of certain cytokine receptors is mediated by  the ubiquitin ligase SCF(βTrCP). In several instances, Janus kinase (Jak) family  members can stabilise their cognate cytokine receptors at the cell surface. PRINCIPAL FINDINGS: In this study we show in Hek293 cells that Jak2 binding to  the growth hormone receptor prevents endocytosis in a non-catalytic manner.  Following receptor activation, the detachment of phosphorylated Jak2 induces  down-regulation of the growth hormone receptor by SCF(βTrCP). Using γ2A human  fibroblast cells we show that both growth hormone-induced and constitutive  growth hormone receptor endocytosis depend on the same factors, strongly  suggesting that the modes of endocytosis are identical. Different Jak2 RNA  levels in HepG2, IM9 and Hek293 cells indicate the importance of cellular  concentration on growth hormone receptor function. Both Jak2 and βTrCP bind to  neighbouring linear motifs in the growth hormone receptor tail without the  requirement of modifications, indicating that growth hormone sensitivity is  regulated by the cellular level of non-committed Jak2. CONCLUSIONS/SIGNIFICANCE: As signal transduction of many cytokine receptors  depends on Jak2, the study suggests an integrative role of Jak2 in cytokine  responses based on its enzyme activity as well as its stabilising properties  towards the receptors.', 'BACKGROUND: The Janus kinase (JAK) family of tyrosine kinases includes JAK1,  JAK2, JAK3 and TYK2, and is required for signaling through Type I and Type II  cytokine receptors. CP-690,550 is a potent and selective JAK inhibitor currently  in clinical trials for rheumatoid arthritis (RA) and other autoimmune disease  indications. In RA trials, dose-dependent decreases in neutrophil counts (PBNC)  were observed with CP-690,550 treatment. These studies were undertaken to better  understand the relationship between JAK selectivity and PBNC decreases observed  with CP-690,550 treatment. METHODS: Potency and selectivity of CP-690,550 for mouse, rat and human JAKs was  evaluated in a panel of in vitro assays. The effect of CP-690,550 on  granulopoiesis from progenitor cells was also assessed in vitro using colony  forming assays. In vivo the potency of orally administered CP-690,550 on  arthritis (paw edema), plasma cytokines, PBNC and bone marrow differentials were  evaluated in the rat adjuvant-induced arthritis (AIA) model. RESULTS: CP-690,550 potently inhibited signaling through JAK1 and JAK3 with  5-100 fold selectivity over JAK2 in cellular assays, despite inhibiting all four  JAK isoforms with nM potency in in vitro enzyme assays. Dose-dependent  inhibition of paw edema was observed in vivo with CP-690,550 treatment. Plasma  cytokines (IL-6 and IL-17), PBNC, and bone marrow myeloid progenitor cells were  elevated in the context of AIA disease. At efficacious exposures, CP-690,550  returned all of these parameters to pre-disease levels. The plasma concentration  of CP-690,550 at efficacious doses was above the in vitro whole blood IC50 of  JAK1 and JAK3 inhibition, but not that of JAK2. CONCLUSION: Results from this investigation suggest that CP-690,550 is a potent  inhibitor of JAK1 and JAK3 with potentially reduced cellular potency for JAK2.  In rat AIA, as in the case of human RA, PBNC were decreased at efficacious  exposures of CP-690,550. Inflammatory end points were similarly reduced, as  judged by attenuation of paw edema and cytokines IL-6 and IL-17. Plasma  concentration at these exposures was consistent with inhibition of JAK1 and JAK3  but not JAK2. Decreases in PBNC following CP-690,550 treatment may thus be  related to attenuation of inflammation and are likely not due to suppression of  granulopoiesis through JAK2 inhibition.', 'There is a critical need for safer and more convenient treatments for organ  transplant rejection and autoimmune disorders such as rheumatoid arthritis.  Janus tyrosine kinases (JAK1, JAK3) are expressed in lymphoid cells and are  involved in the signaling of multiple cytokines important for various T cell  functions. Blockade of the JAK1/JAK3-STAT pathway with a small molecule was  anticipated to provide therapeutic immunosuppression/immunomodulation. The  Pfizer compound library was screened against the catalytic domain of JAK3  resulting in the identification of a pyrrolopyrimidine-based series of  inhibitors represented by CP-352,664 (2a). Synthetic analogues of 2a were  screened against the JAK enzymes and evaluated in an IL-2 induced T cell blast  proliferation assay. Select compounds were evaluated in rodent efficacy models  of allograft rejection and destructive inflammatory arthritis. Optimization  within this chemical series led to identification of CP-690,550 1, a potential  first-in-class JAK inhibitor for treatment of autoimmune diseases and organ  transplant rejection.', 'Alopecia areata (AA) is a common autoimmune disease resulting from damage of the  hair follicle by T cells.

OBJECTIVES: To evaluate the safety and efficacy of baricitinib, an oral Janus  kinase (JAK) 1/JAK2 inhibitor, in patients with moderate-to-severe psoriasis in  a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, dose-ranging phase 2b study. METHODS: Patients were randomized (n = 271) to receive placebo or oral  baricitinib at 2, 4, 8 or 10 mg once daily for 12 weeks (Part A). Dose  adjustment for 12 additional weeks was based on percentage improvement in the  Psoriasis Area and Severity Index (PASI) score. The primary end point was  Psoriasis Area and Severity Index (PASI) 75% (PASI-75) at 12 weeks for North  American patients (n = 238); secondary end points were safety and efficacy  measures in the entire population. RESULTS: At week 12, more North American patients in the 8-mg (43%) and 10-mg  (54%) baricitinib groups than in placebo group (17%; P < 0·05) achieved PASI-75.  All baricitinib-treated groups had greater mean changes from baseline in their  PASI scores (P < 0·05) at 12 weeks and (except 2 mg) had higher rates of PASI-50  than the placebo group; statistically significant PASI-90 responses were  achieved in the 8-mg and 10-mg groups at 8 and 12 weeks. More than 81% of  PASI-75 responders maintained their scores through 24 weeks. During Part A,  study discontinuations due to adverse events (AEs) were 0%, 0%, 2·8%, 6·3% and  5·8% and treatment-emergent AE rates were 44%, 50%, 47%, 58% and 64% for placebo  and 2-, 4-, 8- and 10-mg baricitinib groups, respectively. No opportunistic  infections were observed in any treatment group. Dose-dependent changes in  laboratory values were observed. CONCLUSIONS: Patients with moderate-to-severe psoriasis treated with baricitinib  for 12 weeks achieved significant improvements in PASI-75.', 'Janus kinase (JAK) is one of the main upstream activators of signal transducers  and activators of transcription (STAT) that are constitutively activated in  various malignancies and are associated with cell growth, survival, and  carcinogenesis. Here, we investigated the role of JAKs in colorectal cancer in  order to develop effective therapeutic targets for INCB018424, which is the  first JAK1/2 inhibitor to be approved by FDA. After examining the basal  expression levels of phospho-JAK1 and phospho-JAK2, we measured the effects of  INCB018424 on the phosphorylation of JAK1/2 using western blot analysis. Cell  viability was determined using the trypan blue exclusion assay. The cell death  mechanism was identified by the activation of caspase 3 using western blot and  annexin V staining. The basal levels of phospho-JAK1 and phospho-JAK2 were  cancer cell type dependent. Colorectal cancer cell lines that phosphorylate both  JAK1 and JAK2 include DLD-1 and RKO. INCB018424 inactivates both JAK1 and JAK2  in DLD-1 cells but inactivates only JAK1 in RKO cells. Cell death was  proportional to the inactivation of JAK1 but not JAK2. INCB018424 causes  caspase-dependent cell death, which is prevented by treatment with z-VAD. The  inhibition of JAK1 phosphorylation seemed sufficient to allow  INCB018424-mediated apoptosis. JAK1 is a key molecule that is involved in colon  cancer cell survival and the inhibition of JAK1 by INCB01424 results in  caspase-dependent apoptosis in colorectal cancer cells. The use of selective  JAK1 inhibitors could be an attractive therapy against colorectal cancer, but  further clinical investigations are needed to test this possibility.']]]","In dermatology, Janus Kinases (JAKs) play a crucial role in the regulation of inflammatory pathways that contribute to conditions like psoriasis. Studies have shown that JAK inhibitors, such as tofacitinib and baricitinib, can effectively reduce symptoms of moderate-to-severe psoriasis by targeting JAKs. These inhibitors block the activation of JAKs, which are involved in signaling pathways that lead to inflammation and immune responses. By inhibiting JAKs, these drugs help to reduce the production of pro-inflammatory cytokines, thereby alleviating the skin inflammation characteristic of psoriasis. This makes JAK inhibitors a promising new class of therapeutics for treating chronic skin diseases like psoriasis.","[{'Exact': array([20.48921061, 13.10005324, -4.28432528,  4.07717466,  1.31989472,

Describe the mechanism of action of a drug Elagolix.,"[[['This randomized double-blind study, with 24-week treatment and 24-week  posttreatment periods, evaluated the effects of elagolix (150 mg every day, 75  mg twice a day) versus subcutaneous depot medroxyprogesterone acetate (DMPA-SC)  on bone mineral density (BMD), in women with endometriosis-associated pain (n =  252). All treatments induced minimal mean changes from baseline in BMD at week  24 (elagolix 150 mg: -0.11%/-0.47%, elagolix 75 mg: -1.29%/-1.2%, and DMPA-SC:  0.99%/-1.29% in the spine and total hip, respectively), with similar or less  changes at week 48 (posttreatment). Elagolix was associated with improvements in  endometriosis-associated pain, assessed with composite pelvic signs and symptoms  score (CPSSS) and visual analogue scale, including statistical noninferiority to  DMPA-SC in dysmenorrhea and nonmenstrual pelvic pain components of the CPSSS.  The most common adverse events (AEs) in elagolix groups were headache, nausea,  and nasopharyngitis, whereas the most common AEs in the DMPA-SC group were  headache, nausea, upper respiratory tract infection, and mood swings. This study  showed that similar to DMPA-SC, elagolix treatment had minimal impact on BMD  over a 24-week period and demonstrated similar efficacy on  endometriosis-associated pain.', 'Elagolix (ORILISSA™), an orally bioavailable, second-generation, non-peptide  gonadotropin-releasing hormone (GnRH) receptor antagonist, is being developed  AbbVie and Neurocrine Biosciences for the treatment of reproductive  hormone-dependent disorders in women. In July 2018, the US FDA approved elagolix  tablets for the management of moderate to severe pain associated with  endometriosis. This approval was based on positive results in two replicate  phase III trials; additional phase III trials in the USA, Canada and Puerto Rico  are currently evaluating elagolix as both monotherapy and in combination with  low-dose hormone add-back therapy in the same indication. Elagolix with and  without low-dose hormone add-back therapy is also undergoing phase III clinical  development for heavy menstrual bleeding associated with uterine fibroids in the  aforementioned locations. This article summarizes the milestones in the  development of elagolix leading to its first approval for the management of  moderate to severe pain associated with endometriosis.', 'OBJECTIVE: The aim of this study was to estimate the efficacy of elagolix, an  oral gonadotropin-releasing hormone (GnRH) antagonist, for the treatment of  endometriosis-associated pelvic pain. METHODS: This was a phase II, randomized, placebo-controlled parallel group  study conducted at 37 US centers, consisting of an 8-week double-blind period  followed by a 16-week open-label period. Patients were 137 women aged 18 to 49,  with laparoscopically confirmed endometriosis and moderate to severe  nonmenstrual pelvic pain and dysmenorrhea, who were administered elagolix 150 mg  daily or placebo. The primary outcomes of the study were the daily assessment of  dysmenorrhea, nonmenstrual pelvic pain and dyspareunia using a modified  Biberoglu-Behrman scale. RESULTS: During the double-blind period, there were significantly greater mean  reductions from baseline to week 8 in dysmenorrhea (-1.13 ± 0.11 vs. -0.37 ±  0.11, p<0.0001), nonmenstrual pelvic pain (-0.47 ± 0.07 vs. -0.19 ± 0.07, p =  0.0066), and dyspareunia scores (-0.61 ± 0.10 vs. -0.23 ± 0.10, p = 0.0070) in  the elagolix group compared with placebo. Continued improvements were observed  during the open-label treatment regardless of initial treatment allocation.  Elagolix treatment was also associated with significant improvements in  quality-of-life measures during the double-blind and open-label periods. The  most common adverse events occurring with elagolix were nausea, headache and hot  flush, each in 9.9% of patients. CONCLUSION: Elagolix effectively reduced endometriosis-associated pelvic pain  over a 24-week period and was well-tolerated.', ""Uterine fibroids (UFs) are the most common gynaecological benign disease. Even  though often asymptomatic, UFs can worsen women's health and their quality of  life, causing heavy bleeding and anaemia, pelvic discomfort and reduced  fertility. Surgical treatment of UFs could be limited by its invasiveness and  the desire to preserve fertility. Thus, effective medical therapies for the  management of this condition are needed. Common drugs used to control bleeding,  such us hormonal contraceptive or levonorgestrel-releasing intrauterine system,  have no effect on fibroids volume. Among other more efficient treatments, the  gonadotropin-releasing hormone (GnRH) agonist or the selective  progesterone-receptor modulators have a non-neutral safety profile; thus, they  are used for limited periods or for cyclic treatments. Elagolix is a potent,  orally bioavailable, non-peptide GnRH antagonist that acts by a competitive  block of the GnRH receptor. The biological effect is a dose-dependent inhibition  of gonadal axis, without a total suppression of estradiol concentrations. For  this reason, even though comparative studies between elagolix and GnRH agonists  have not been performed, elagolix has been associated with a better profile of  adverse events. Recently, elagolix received US FDA approval for the treatment of  moderate to severe pain caused by endometriosis. Several clinical trials  assessed the efficacy of elagolix for the treatment of heavy bleeding caused by  UFs and the definitive results of Phase III studies are expected. Available data  on elagolix and UFs showed that the drug, with or without low-dose hormone  add-back therapy, is able to significantly reduce menstrual blood loss, lead to  amenorrhea and improve haemoglobin concentrations in the majority of  participants in comparison with placebo. The safety and tolerability profile  appeared generally acceptable. The concomitant use of add-back therapy can  prevent bone loss due to the hypoestrogenic effect and can improve safety during  elagolix treatment."", 'We investigated a series of uracil analogues by introducing various substituents  on the phenyl ring of the N-3 aminoethyl side chain and evaluated their  antagonistic activity against human gonadotropin-releasing hormone (GnRH)  receptors. Analogues with substituents at the ortho or meta position  demonstrated potent in\xa0vitro antagonistic activity. Specifically, the  introduction of a 2-OMe group enhanced nuclear factor of activated T-cells  (NFAT) inhibition up to 6-fold compared to the unsubstituted analogue. We  identified compound 12c as a highly potent GnRH antagonist with moderate CYP  inhibition. Compound 12c showed potent and prolonged LH suppression after a  single dose was orally administered in castrated monkeys compared to a known  antagonist, Elagolix. We believe that our SAR study offers useful insights to  design GnRH antagonists as a potential treatment option for endometriosis.', 'PURPOSE: Limitated studies have reported the efficacy of GnRH antagonist on  endometriosis symptoms. The aim of our study was to review all available trials  to investigate the medical treatment of endometriosis with only GnRH  antagonists, with special attention to pharmacodynamic activity, safety, and  efficacy. METHODS: Pub Med and Sciencedirect database were searched using terms of  ""endometriosis treatment"", ""GnRH antagonist"", and ""Elagolix"". The search was  limited to clinical studies published in English. Title and abstract were  screened to identify relevant articles. RESULTS: Five studies covering use of GnRH antagonist were found. A phase 1  study evaluated the safety, pharmacokinetics, and inhibitory effects on  gonadotropins and estradiol of single dose and 7 day elagolix administration to  healthy premenopausal women; two phase II studies evaluated efficacy in patient  with endometriosis. Moreover, there are two Phase III clinical trials just  completed. CONCLUSION: GnRH antagonists may have the advantage of oral administration and  lower incidence of adverse events. Currently, only Phase II studies have been  published demonstrating promising results in terms of efficacy, safety, and  tolerability.

This article summarizes the milestones in the  development of elagolix leading to its first approval for the management of  moderate to severe pain associated with endometriosis.', 'BACKGROUND: Uterine fibroids are one of the most common neoplasms found among  women globally, with a prevalence of approximately 11 million women in the  United States alone. The morbidity of this common disease is significant because  it is the leading cause of hysterectomy and causes significant functional  impairment for women of reproductive age. Factors including age, body mass  index, race, ethnicity, menstrual blood loss, fibroid location, and uterine and  fibroid volume influence the incidence of fibroids and severity of symptoms.  Elagolix is an oral gonadotropin-releasing hormone receptor antagonist that  competitively inhibits pituitary gonadotropin-releasing hormone receptor  activity and suppresses the release of gonadotropins from the pituitary gland,  resulting in dose-dependent suppression of ovarian sex hormones, follicular  growth, and ovulation. In Elaris Uterine Fibroids 1 and Uterine Fibroids 2, 2  replicate multicenter, double-blind, randomized, placebo-controlled, phase 3  studies, treatment of premenopausal women with elagolix with hormonal add-back  therapy demonstrated reduction in heavy menstrual bleeding associated with  uterine fibroids. OBJECTIVE: This analysis aimed to evaluate the safety and efficacy of elagolix  (300 mg twice a day) with add-back therapy (1 mg estradiol/0.5 mg norethindrone  acetate once a day) in reducing heavy menstrual bleeding associated with uterine  fibroids in various subgroups of women over 6 months of treatment. STUDY DESIGN: Data were pooled from Elaris Uterine Fibroid-1 and Uterine  Fibroid-2 studies, which evaluated premenopausal women (18-51 years) with heavy  menstrual bleeding (>80 mL menstrual blood loss per cycle, alkaline hematin  methodology) and ultrasound-confirmed uterine fibroid diagnosis. Subgroups  analyzed included age, body mass index, race, ethnicity, baseline menstrual  blood loss, fibroid location, and uterine and primary fibroid volume (largest  fibroid identified by ultrasound). The primary endpoint was the proportion of  women with <80 mL menstrual blood loss during the final month and ≥50% menstrual  blood loss reduction from baseline to final month. Secondary and other efficacy  endpoints included mean change in menstrual blood loss from baseline to final  month, amenorrhea, symptom severity, and health-related quality of life. Adverse  events and other safety endpoints were monitored. RESULTS: The overall pooled Elaris Uterine Fibroid-1 and Uterine Fibroid-2  population was typical of women with fibroids, with a mean age of 42.4 (standard  deviation, 5.4) years and a mean body mass index of 33.6 (standard deviation,  7.3) kg/m2 and 67.6% of participants being black or African American women. A  wide range of baseline uterine and fibroid volumes and menstrual blood loss were  also represented in the overall pooled study population. In all subgroups, the  proportion of responders to the primary endpoint, mean change in menstrual blood  loss, amenorrhea, reduction in symptom severity, and improvement in  health-related quality of life were clinically meaningfully greater for women  who received elagolix with add-back therapy than those who received placebo and  consistent with the overall pooled study population for the primary endpoint  (72.2% vs 9.3%), mean change in menstrual blood loss (-172.5 mL vs\xa0-0.8 mL),  amenorrhea (50.4% vs 4.5%), symptom severity (-37.1 vs\xa0-9.2), and health-related  quality of life score (39.9 vs 8.9). Adverse events by subgroup were consistent  with the overall pooled study population. CONCLUSION: Elagolix with hormonal add-back therapy was effective in reducing  heavy menstrual bleeding associated with uterine fibroids independent of age,  body mass index, race, ethnicity, baseline menstrual blood loss, fibroid  location, and uterine and primary fibroid volume.']]]","Elagolix acts as an oral, non-peptide gonadotropin-releasing hormone (GnRH) receptor antagonist. It competitively blocks the GnRH receptor, leading to a dose-dependent inhibition of the gonadal axis. This results in a reduction of gonadotropins and estradiol concentrations without completely suppressing estradiol levels. As a consequence, it provides a therapeutic effect in managing conditions related to reproductive hormone-dependent disorders by reducing symptoms such as endometriosis-associated pain and heavy menstrual bleeding associated with uterine fibroids.","[{'Exact': array([ 5.41641896, 19.33245377,  2.64063138, 79.53482768, -1.59890886,

Is recommended the use of perioperative treatment with thyroid hormone therapy in patients undergoing coronary artery bypass grafting?,"[[['CONTEXT: Effects of thyroid hormone therapy on postoperative morbidity and  mortality in adults remain controversial. OBJECTIVE: The aim was to conduct a systematic review evaluating effects and  risks of postoperative T(3) therapy in adults. DATA SOURCES: Electronic databases and reference lists through March 2010 were  searched. STUDY SELECTION: Studies with comparable control groups comparing T(3) to  placebo therapy in randomized controlled trials were selected. DATA EXTRACTION: Two reviewers independently screened and reviewed titles,  abstracts, and articles. Data were abstracted from 14 randomized controlled  trials (13 cardiac surgery and one renal transplantation). In seven studies, iv  T(3) was given in high doses (0.175-0.333 μg/kg · h) for 6 to 9 h, in four  studies iv T(3) was given in low doses (0.0275-0.0333 μg/kg · h for 14 to 24 h),  and in three studies T(3) was given orally in variable doses and durations. DATA SYNTHESIS: Both high- and low-dose iv T(3) therapy increased cardiac index  after coronary artery bypass surgery. Mortality was not significantly altered by  high-dose iv T(3) therapy and could not be assessed for low-dose iv or oral  T(3). Effects on systemic vascular resistance, heart rate, pulmonary capillary  wedge pressure, new onset atrial fibrillation, inotrope use, serum TSH and T(4)  were inconclusive. LIMITATIONS: Numbers of usable unique studies and group sizes were small.  Duration of T(3) therapy was short, and dosages and routes of administration  varied. CONCLUSIONS: Short duration postoperative iv T(3) therapy increases cardiac  index and does not alter mortality. Effects on other parameters are  inconclusive.', 'OBJECTIVE: Despite improved perioperative management, atrial fibrillation (AF)  after coronary artery bypass grafting (CABG) remains a relevant clinical  problem, whose pathogenetic mechanisms remain incompletely explained. A reduced  incidence of postoperative AF has been described in CABG patients receiving IV  tri-iodothyronine (T3). This study was designed to define the role of thyroid  metabolism on the genesis of postoperative AF. METHODS AND RESULTS: Free T3 (fT3), free thyroxine (fT4), and thyroid  stimulating hormone were assayed at admission in 107 consecutive patients  undergoing isolated CABG surgery. Patients with thyroid disease or taking drugs  known to interfere with thyroid function were excluded. A preoperative rhythm  other than sinus rhythm was considered an exclusion criterion. Thirty-three  patients (30.8%) had postoperative AF. An older age (P=0.03), no therapy with  beta-blockers (P=0.08), chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (P=0.08), lower  left ventricle ejection fraction (P=0.09) and lower fT3 concentration (P=0.001),  were univariate predictors of postoperative AF. On multivariate analysis, low  fT3 concentration and lack of beta-blocking therapy were independently related  with the development of postoperative AF (odds ratio, OR, 4.425; 95% confidence  interval, CI, 1.745-11.235; P=0.001 and OR 3.107; 95% CI 1.087-8.875; P=0.03,  respectively). Postoperative AF significantly prolonged postoperative hospital  stay (P=0.002). CONCLUSIONS: Low basal fT3 concentration can reliably predict the occurrence of  postoperative AF in CABG patients.', 'Thyroid hormone has important effects on the heart and peripheral vascular  system. The relationship between thyroid disease states and cardiovascular  hemodynamics is well recognized. Diverse clinical situations are associated with  low serum triiodothyronine (T3) levels including a number of cardiovascular  illnesses. In particular, cardiopulmonary bypass and open heart operations  result in a low T3 state and are often complicated by significant cardiovascular  dysfunction similar to that observed in clinical hypothyroidism. Multiple lines  of evidence have suggested that T3 can act acutely as a positive inotrope and  vasodilator agent. This recognition has prompted a number of investigators to  study the effects of T3 administration to patients in the perioperative period.  This paper reviews the experimental background that supported such clinical  trials as well as outlines the results that have been documented in both adult  and pediatric patients undergoing cardiac surgery. Low serum T3 levels resulting  from cardiopulmonary bypass can be safely reversed with pharmacologic T3  supplementation. Data have suggested that T3 repletion may improve postoperative  hemodynamic performance and lower the incidence of arrythmias. However,  beneficial effects on major clinical outcome variables have not yet been  conclusively demonstrated, and require future large-scale clinical trials.', 'A controversy persists as to whether cardiopulmonary bypass (CPB) decreases  plasma levels of triiodothyronine (T3), thereby justifying peri-operative  administration of T3 to improve haemodynamic recovery. To examine the effects of  T3 therapy on post-CPB haemodynamics and to determine whether the potential  inotropic effects of T3 are mediated by an increase in beta-adrenergic  responsiveness, a prospective, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled  study was performed in 20 patients undergoing cardiac surgery with CPB. T3 or  placebo solution (10 patients in each group) was given intravenously at the time  of aortic unclamping and 4, 8, 12 and 20 h thereafter. End points included (1)  thyroid hormone levels measured by radioimmunoassay (2) standard haemodynamic  parameters (3) the density of lymphocyte beta-adrenoceptors measured by a  radioligand (125I-iodocyanopindolol) binding technique. Post-CPB values (cross  clamp removal) of T3 (pg.ml-1) were not significantly decreased compared with  pre-CPB values: 3.3 +/- 0.2 vs 3.1 +/- 0.2 in controls and 3.3 +/- 0.4 vs 3.7  +/- 0.6 in T3-treated patients, respectively. The haemodynamic parameters were  no different between the two groups at any postoperative time point. Likewise,  density and affinity of lymphocyte beta-adrenoceptors were not significantly  different from pre-operative values in either group. Thus, there seems to be no  sound justification for a routine use of T3 in patients undergoing open-heart  procedures.', 'OBJECTIVE: Despite improved perioperative management, atrial fibrillation (AF)  after coronary artery bypass grafting (CABG) remains a relevant clinical  problem, whose pathogenetic mechanisms remain incompletely explained.

Postoperative AF significantly prolonged postoperative hospital  stay (P=0.002). CONCLUSIONS: Low basal fT3 concentration can reliably predict the occurrence of  postoperative AF in CABG patients.', 'Thyroid hormone alterations (known as the ""sick-euthyroid syndrome"") are common  following major surgery, but the time course for appearance and recovery from  these alterations has not previously been longitudinally studied in a large  group of surgical patients. The authors prospectively studied 59 patients  undergoing major surgery (coronary artery bypass grafting, pneumonectomy, or  subtotal colectomy). Compared with preoperative values, the mean serum T4, T3,  free T3, and TSH concentrations decreased significantly (p less than 0.05)  following surgery. Serum reverse T3 and T3 resin uptake index increased, while  free T4 levels remained unchanged. These changes were seen within 6 hours of  surgery and normalized by 1 week after surgery. Although the serum TSH response  to TRH was normal before and after surgery in 56 of the 59 patients, the maximal  TRH-induced increase in serum TSH and the integrated serum TSH response to TRH  were suppressed in the early perioperative period. This postoperative TSH  suppression correlated with elevated postoperative plasma dopamine  concentrations (r = 0.57, p less than 0.05). Three patients with compensated  primary hypothyroidism were detected in the study and represent the first  documentation of serial thyroid hormone and TSH levels in hypothyroid patients  undergoing major surgery. These patients had similar changes in thyroid hormone  values compared with euthyroid patients. The serum TSH response to TRH was  suppressed into the normal range in two of these patients on the day following  surgery. The authors conclude that the sick-euthyroid syndrome occurs within a  few hours of major surgery and remits with convalescence. Postoperative  decreases in serum TSH may mask the diagnosis of hypothyroidism. Surgical  consultants should be aware of these rapid postoperative changes so that thyroid  function tests are properly interpreted in patients who have undergone major  surgery.', 'Cardiac surgery using cardiopulmonary bypass produces a generalized systemic  inflammatory response, resulting in increased postoperative morbidity and  mortality. Under these circumstances, a typical pattern of thyroid abnormalities  is seen in the absence of primary disease, defined as sick euthyroid syndrome  (SES). The presence of postoperative SES mainly in small children and neonates  exposed to long bypass times and the pharmacological profile of thyroid hormones  and their effects on the cardiovascular physiology make supplementation therapy  an attractive treatment option to improve postoperative morbidity and mortality.  Many studies have been performed with conflicting results. In this article, we  review the important literature on the development of SES in paediatric  postoperative cardiac patients, analyse the existing information on thyroid  hormone replacement therapy in this patient group and try to summarize the  findings for a recommendation.', 'BACKGROUND: The impact of thyroid disease on patients undergoing coronary artery  bypass grafting has been reported in only small series of selected patients. METHODS: We investigated 30-day mortality of patients on thyroxine replacement  therapy undergoing isolated coronary artery bypass grafting from 1993 to 2000  and identified variables of importance for outcome. RESULTS: A total of 3,631 patients (606 women) had isolated coronary artery  bypass grafting of whom 58 patients (30 women) were treated for hypothyroidism.  The mortality rate was higher among women with thyroxine replacement (16.7%, 95%  confidence interval [CI] 5.6 to 34.7) than those without thyroxine replacement  (5.9%, 95% CI 4.1 to 8.2; p = 0.02) and no difference between men with (3.6%,  95% CI 0.1 to 17.8) and without (2.6%, 95% CI 2.0 to 3.2) thyroxine treatment (p  = 0.8). Intake of diuretics (p < 0.001) was directly associated with mortality  whereas intake of aspirin (p = 0.01), levothyroxine dose (p = 0.03), and serum  thyroxine level (p = 0.01) were inversely associated with mortality among women  on thyroxine replacement. CONCLUSIONS: Women on thyroxine replacement therapy undergoing coronary artery  bypass grafting had an increased mortality rate. We speculate that insufficient  thyroid hormone replacement could partly play a role in this outcome.', 'BACKGROUND: Cardiopulmonary bypass (CPB) is an established cause of nonthyroidal  illness syndrome (NTIS). Off-pump coronary artery bypass (OPCAB) has been  reported to be less invasive than coronary artery bypass grafting (CABG) with  CPB. We prospectively evaluated thyroid metabolism in OPCAB patients. METHODS: We analyzed free thyroid hormones (FT3 and FT4), thyroid-stimulating  hormone (TSH), and reverse T3 (rT3) in 20 consecutive patients undergoing CABG  surgery. Nine patients underwent CABG with CPB, and 11 underwent OPCAB. Blood  samples were taken on admission, on the day of surgery (7:30 AM), after  sternotomy, at the end of the operation, and at 2, 6, 12, 24, 36, 48, 72, 96,  120, and 144 hours postoperatively. The concentrations of FT3, FT4, and TSH were  determined on each sample. Reverse T3 concentration was measured in 10 patients  up to 48 hours and at 144 hours postoperatively. RESULTS: Baseline, operative, and postoperative variables were similar in the  two groups. FT3 concentration dropped significantly (p < 0.0001), reaching its  lowest value 12 hours postoperatively. There were no significant differences  between CPB and OPCAB patients. FT4 varied significantly in both groups (p <  0.0001), but remained in the normal range. TSH variation was not significant.  rT3 concentration rose significantly (p = 0.0002) in both groups, peaking 24  hours after surgery. CONCLUSIONS. OPCAB induces a NTIS similar to that observed  after CPB, probably due to the inhibition of T4 conversion to T3. This finding  suggests that NTIS is a nonspecific response to stress. CPB should not be  considered as the sole trigger of NTIS in cardiac surgical patients.', 'BACKGROUND: Although triiodothyronine deficiency has been described after  cardiopulmonary bypass, data supporting its use have been conflicting. A  double-blind, randomized, placebo-controlled study was undertaken to further  define the effect of triiodothyronine on hemodynamics and outcome after coronary  artery bypass grafting. METHODS: A total of 170 patients undergoing elective coronary artery bypass  grafting were enrolled and completed the study from November 1996 through March  1998. On removal of the aortic crossclamp, patients were randomized to receive  either intravenous triiodothyronine (0.4 microgram/kg bolus plus 0.1  microgram/kg infusion administered over a 6-hour period, n = 81) or placebo (n =  89). Outcome variables included hemodynamic profile and inotropic drug/pressor  requirements at several time points (mean +/- standard error of the mean),  perioperative morbidity (arrhythmia/ischemia/infarction), and mortality. RESULTS: Despite similar baseline characteristics, patients randomized to  triiodothyronine had a higher cardiac index and lower inotropic requirements  after the operation. Subjects receiving triiodothyronine demonstrated a  significantly lower incidence of postoperative myocardial ischemia (4% vs 18%, P  =.007) and pacemaker dependence (14% vs 25%, P =.013). Seven patients in the  placebo group required postoperative mechanical assistance (intra-aortic balloon  pump, n = 4; left ventricular assist device, n = 3), compared with none in the  triiodothyronine group (P =.01). There were 2 deaths in the placebo group and no  deaths in the triiodothyronine group. CONCLUSIONS: Parenteral triiodothyronine given after crossclamp removal during  elective coronary artery bypass grafting significantly improved postoperative  ventricular function, reduced the need for treatment with inotropic agents and  mechanical devices, and decreased the incidence of myocardial ischemia. The  incidence of atrial fibrillation was slightly decreased, and the need for  postoperative pacemaker support was reduced.']]]","Based on the information provided, there is no clear recommendation to use perioperative treatment with thyroid hormone therapy in all patients undergoing coronary artery bypass grafting (CABG). The studies reviewed suggest that:

1. **Short-term benefits**: Low-dose intravenous tri-iodothyronine (T3) therapy can increase cardiac index and reduce the need for inotropic agents and mechanical devices in some patients after CABG surgery.
   
2. **Mixed outcomes**: While some studies show beneficial effects, others do not find significant differences in mortality or other major clinical outcomes.

3. **Specific populations**: There is some evidence suggesting that low T3 levels might predict the occurrence of postoperative atrial fibrillation (AF) in CABG patients.

4. **Potential risks**: The use of thyroid hormone therapy is not without risk, as it can lead to adverse effects like hyperthyroidism if not carefully managed.

Given these mixed results, the paper concludes that while perioperative T3 therapy may offer","[{'Exact': array([58.78302414, 19.32826021, 19.77762943,  5.61094684, 19.01838452,

Is enzastaurin effective treatment of glioblastoma?,"[[['The prognosis of patients with glioblastoma, anaplastic astrocytoma, and  anaplastic oligodendroglioma remains poor despite standard treatment with  radiotherapy and temozolomide. Molecular targeted therapy holds the promise of  providing new, more effective treatment options with minimal toxicity. However,  the development of targeted therapy for gliomas has been particularly  challenging. The oncogenetic process in such tumors is driven by several  signaling pathways that are differentially activated or silenced with both  parallel and converging complex interactions. Therefore, it has been difficult  to identify prevalent targets that act as key promoters of oncogenesis and that  can be successfully addressed by novel agents. Several drugs have been tested,  including epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) tyrosine kinase inhibitors  (gefitinib and erlotinib), mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR) inhibitors  (temsirolimus and everolimus), and vascular endothelial growth factor receptor  (VEGFR), protein kinase C-beta, and other angiogenesis pathways inhibitors  (vatalanib, bevacizumab, and enzastaurin). Although preliminary efficacy results  of most trials in recurrent disease have fallen short on expectations,  substantial advances have been achieved by associated translational research. In  this article, we seek to recapitulate the lessons learned in the development of  targeted therapy for gliomas, including challenges and pitfalls in the  interpretation of preclinical data, specific issues in glioma trial design,  insights provided by translational research, changes in paradigms, and future  perspectives.', 'Current treatment strategies in patients with newly-diagnosed glioblastoma  include surgical resection with post-operative radiotherapy and  concomitant/adjuvant temozolomide (the ""Stupp protocol"") or resection with  implantation of 1,3-bis(2-chloroethyl)-1-nitrosourea (BCNU) wafers in the  surgical cavity followed by radiotherapy. In clinical practice, patients with  malignant glioma treated with BCNU wafer often also receive adjuvant  temozolomide. However, current treatment guidelines are unclear on whether and  how these treatment practices can be combined, and no prospective phase 3 study  has assessed the safety and efficacy of combining BCNU wafers with temozolomide  and radiation in high-grade malignant glioma. The rationale for multimodal  therapy comprising surgical resection with adjunct local BCNU wafers followed by  radiotherapy and temozolomide is based on complementary and synergistic  mechanisms of action between BCNU and temozolomide in preclinical studies; a  shared primary resistance pathway, methylguanine-DNA methyltransferase (MGMT);  and the opportunity to overcome resistance through MGMT depletion to boost  cytotoxic activity. A comprehensive review of the literature identified 19  retrospective and prospective studies investigating the use of this multimodal  strategy. Median overall survival in 14 studies of newly-diagnosed patients  suggested a modest improvement versus resection followed by Stupp protocol or  resection with BCNU wafers, with an acceptable and manageable safety profile.', 'This open-label, single-arm, phase II study combined enzastaurin with  temozolomide plus radiation therapy (RT) to treat glioblastoma multiforme (GBM)  and gliosarcoma. Adults with newly diagnosed disease and Karnofsky performance  status (KPS) ≥ 60 were enrolled. Treatment was started within 5 weeks after  surgical diagnosis. RT consisted of 60 Gy over 6 weeks. Temozolomide was given  at 75 mg/m(2) daily during RT and then adjuvantly at 200 mg/m(2) daily for 5  days, followed by a 23-day break. Enzastaurin was given once daily during RT and  in the adjuvant period at 250 mg/day. Cycles were 28 days. The primary end point  was overall survival (OS). Progression-free survival (PFS), toxicity, and  correlations between efficacy and molecular markers analyzed from tumor tissue  samples were also evaluated. A prospectively planned analysis compared OS and  PFS of the current trial with outcomes from 3 historical phase II trials that  combined novel agents with temozolomide plus RT in patients with GBM or  gliosarcoma. Sixty-six patients were enrolled. The treatment regimen was well  tolerated. OS (median, 74 weeks) and PFS (median, 36 weeks) results from the  current trial were comparable to those from a prior phase II study using  erlotinib and were significantly better than those from 2 other previous studies  that used thalidomide or cis-retinoic acid, all in combination with temozolomide  plus RT. A positive correlation between O-6-methylguanine-DNA methyltransferase  promoter methylation and OS was observed. Adjusting for age and KPS, no other  biomarker was associated with survival outcome. Correlation of relevant  biomarkers with OS may be useful in future trials.', 'Randomized phase III trials have shown significant improvement of survival 1, 2,  and 3 years after implantation of 1,3-bis (2-chloroethyl)-1-nitrosourea (BCNU)  wafers for patients with newly diagnosed malignant glioma. But these studies and  subsequent non-phase III studies have also shown risks associated with local  chemotherapy within the central nervous system. The introduction of concomitant  radiochemotherapy with temozolomide (TMZ) has later demonstrated a survival  benefit in a phase III trial and has become the current treatment standard for  newly diagnosed malignant glioma patients. Lately, this has resulted in clinical  protocols combining local chemotherapy with BCNU wafers and concomitant  radiochemotherapy with TMZ although this may carry the risk of increased  toxicity. We have compiled the treatment experience of seven neurosurgical  centers using implantation of carmustine wafers at primary surgery followed by 6  weeks of radiation therapy (59-60 Gy) and 75 mg/m(2)/day TMZ in patients with  newly diagnosed glioblastoma followed by TMZ monochemotherapy. We have  retrospectively analyzed the postoperative clinical course, occurrence and  severity of adverse events, progression-free interval, and overall survival in  44 patients with newly diagnosed glioblastoma multiforme. All patients received  multimodal treatment including tumor resection, BCNU wafer implantation, and  concomitant radiochemotherapy. Of 44 patients (mean age 59\u2009±\u200910.8 years) with  glioblastoma who received Gliadel wafer at primary surgery, 28 patients (64%)  had died, 16 patients (36%) were alive, and 15 patients showed no evidence of  clinical or radiographic progression after a median follow-up of 15.6 months. At  time of analysis of adverse events in this patient population, the median  overall survival was 12.7 months and median progression-free survival was 7.0  months. Surgical, neurological, and medical adverse events were analyzed.  Twenty-three patients (52%) experienced adverse events of any kind including  complications that did not require treatment. Nineteen patients (43%)  experienced grade 3 or grade 4 adverse events. Surgical complications included  cerebral edema, healing abnormalities, cerebral spinal fluid leakage,  meningitis, intracranial abscess, and hydrocephalus. Neurological adverse events  included newly diagnosed seizures, alteration of mental status, and new  neurological deficits. Medical complications were thromboembolic events  (thrombosis, pulmonary embolism) and hematotoxicity. Combination of both  treatment strategies, local chemotherapy with BCNU wafer and concomitant  radiochemotherapy, appears attractive in aggressive multimodal treatment  schedules and may utilize the sensitizing effect of TMZ and carmustine on MGMT  and AGT on their respective drug resistance genes. Our data demonstrate that  combination of local chemotherapy and concomitant radiochemotherapy carries a  significant risk of toxicity that currently appears underestimated. Adverse  events observed in this study appear similar to complication rates published in  the phase III trials for BCNU wafer implantation followed by radiation therapy  alone, but further add the toxicity of concomitant radiochemotherapy with  systemic TMZ. Save use of a combined approach will require specific prevention  strategies for multimodal treatments.', ""INTRODUCTION: Glioblastoma, the most common malignant brain tumor, exhibits a  poor prognosis with little therapeutic progress in the last decade. Novel  treatment strategies beyond the established standard of care with  temozolomide-based radiotherapy are urgently needed. AREAS COVERED: We reviewed the literature on glioblastoma with a focus on phase  III trials for pharmacotherapies and/or innovative concepts until December 2015. EXPERT OPINION: In the last decade, phase III trials on novel compounds largely  failed to introduce efficacious pharmacotherapies beyond temozolomide in  glioblastoma. So far, inhibition of angiogenesis by compounds such as  bevacizumab, cediranib, enzastaurin or cilengitide as well as alternative dosing  schedules of temozolomide did not prolong survival, neither at primary diagnosis  nor at recurrent disease. Promising strategies of pharmacotherapy currently  under evaluation represent targeting epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR)  with biomarker-stratified patient populations and immunotherapeutic concepts  including checkpoint inhibition and vaccination. The clinical role of the  medical device delivering 'tumor-treating fields' in newly diagnosed  glioblastoma which prolonged overall survival in a phase III study has remained  controversial. After failure of several phase III trials with previously  promising agents, improvement of concepts and novel compounds are urgently  needed to expand the still limited therapeutic options for the treatment of  glioblastoma."", ""OBJECT: The objective of this study was to report the authors' experience with  the long-term administration of temozolomide (TMZ; > 6 cycles, up to 101) in  patients with newly diagnosed glioblastoma and to analyze its feasibility and  safety as well as its impact on survival. The authors also compared data  obtained from the group of patients undergoing long-term TMZ treatment with data  from patients treated with a standard TMZ protocol. METHODS: A retrospective analysis was conducted of 37 patients who underwent  operations for glioblastoma between 2004 and 2012. Volumetric analysis of  postoperative Gd-enhanced MR images, obtained within 48 hours, confirmed tumor  gross-total resection (GTR) in all but 2 patients. All patients received the  first cycle of TMZ at a dosage of 150 mg/m(2) starting on the second or third  postsurgical day. Afterward, patients received concomitant radiochemotherapy  according to the Stupp protocol. With regard to adjuvant TMZ therapy, the 19  patients in Group A, aged 30-72 years (mean 56.1 years), received 150 mg/m(2)  for 5 days every 28 days for more than 6 cycles (range 7-101 cycles). The 18  patients in Group B, aged 46-82 years (mean 64.8 years), received the same dose,  but for no more than 6 cycles. O(6)-methylguanine-DNA methyltransferase (MGMT)  promoter methylation status was analyzed for both groups and correlated with  overall survival (OS) and progression-free survival (PFS). The impact of age,  sex, Karnofsky Performance Scale score, and Ki 67 staining were also considered. RESULTS: All patients but 1 in Group A survived at least 18 months (range 18-101  months), and patients in Group B survived no more than 17 months (range 2-17  months). The long-term survivors (Group A), defined as patients who survived at  least 12 months after diagnosis, were 51.3% of the total (19/37). Kaplan-Meier  curve analysis showed that patients treated with more than 6 TMZ cycles had OS  and PFS that was significantly longer than patients receiving standard treatment  (median OS 28 months vs 8 months, respectively; p = 0.0001; median PFS 20 months  vs 4 months, respectively; p = 0.0002). By univariate and multivariate Cox  proportional hazard regression analysis, MGMT methylation status and number of  TMZ cycles appeared to be survival prognostic factors in patients with  glioblastoma. After controlling for MGMT status, highly significant differences  related to OS and PFS between patients with standard and long-term TMZ treatment  were still detected. Furthermore, in Group A and B, the statistical correlation  of MGMT status to the number of TMZ cycles showed a significant difference only  in Group A patients, suggesting that MGMT promoter methylation was predictive of  response for long-term TMZ treatment. Prolonged therapy did not confer  hematological toxicity or opportunistic infections in either patient group. CONCLUSIONS: This study describes the longest experience so far reported with  TMZ in patients with newly diagnosed glioblastomas, with as many as 101 cycles,  who were treated using GTR. Statistically significant data confirm that median  survival correlates with MGMT promoter methylation status as well as with the  number of TMZ cycles administered. Long-term TMZ therapy appears feasible and  safe."", ""BACKGROUND: This study's primary objective was evaluation of the  progression-free survival rate at 6 months (PFS-6) in patients with newly  diagnosed glioblastoma without O(6)-methylguanine-DNA-methyltransferase (MGMT)  promoter hypermethylation postsurgically treated with enzastaurin before and  concomitantly with radiation therapy, followed by enzastaurin maintenance  therapy. PFS-6 of at least 55% was set to be relevant compared with the data of  the EORTC 26981/22981 NCIC CE.3 trial. METHODS: Adult patients with a life expectancy of at least 12 weeks who were  newly diagnosed with a histologically proven supratentorial glioblastoma without  MGMT promoter hypermethylation were eligible. Patients were treated with  enzastaurin prior to, concomitantly with, and after standard partial brain  radiotherapy. Here we report on a multicenter, open-label, uncontrolled phase II  study of patients with newly diagnosed glioblastoma without MGMT promoter  hypermethylation treated with enzastaurin and radiation therapy within 4 study  periods. RESULTS: PFS-6 was 53.6% (95% confidence interval [CI]: 39.8-65.6). The median  overall survival was 15.0 months (95% CI: 11.9-17.9) for all patients, 3.9  months (95% CI: 0.8-9.0) for patients with biopsy, 15.4 months (95% CI:  10.1-17.9) for patients with partial resection, and 18.9 months (95% CI:  13.9-28.5) for patients with complete resection. The safety profile in this  study was as expected from previous trials, and the therapy was well tolerated. CONCLUSIONS: PFS-6 missed the primary planned outcome of 55%. The secondary  exploratory analysis according to resection status of the different subgroups of  patients with biopsies, partial resection, and complete resection demonstrates  the strong prognostic influence of resection on overall survival."", 'BACKGROUND: The study investigated if intraoperative use of carmustine wafers,  particularly in combination with Stupp regimen, is a viable and safe first-line  treatment option of glioblastomas. METHODS: Eighty-three consecutive adult patients (50 men; mean age 60 years)  with newly diagnosed supratentorial primary glioblastomas that underwent  surgical resection with intraoperative carmustine wafers implantation (n = 7.1 ±  1.7) were retrospectively studied. RESULTS: The median overall survival (OS) was 15.8 months with 56 patients dying  over the course of the study. There was no significant association between the  number of implanted carmustine wafers and complication rates (four surgical site  infections, one death). The OS was significantly longer in Stupp regimen  patients (19.5 months) as compared with patients with other postoperative  treatments (13 months; p = 0.002). In addition patients with eight or more  implanted carmustine wafers survived longer (24.5 months) than patients with  seven or less implanted wafers (13 months; p = 0.021). Finally, regardless of  the number of carmustine wafers, median OS was significantly longer in patients  with a subtotal or total resection (21.5 months) than in patients with a partial  resection (13 months; p = 0.011). CONCLUSIONS: The intraoperative use of carmustine wafers in combination with  Stupp regimen is a viable first-line treatment option of glioblastomas. The  prognostic value of this treatment association should be evaluated in a  multicenter trial, ideally in a randomized and placebo-controlled one.', 'BACKGROUND: glioblastomas are highly vascularized tumors and various  antiangiogenic drugs have been investigated in clinical trials showing unclear  results. We performed a systematic review and a meta-analysis to clarify and  evaluate their effectiveness in glioblastoma patients. PATIENTS AND METHODS: we searched relevant published and unpublished randomized  clinical trials analyzing antiangiogenic drugs versus chemotherapy in  glioblastoma patients from January 2006 to January 2016 in MEDLINE, WEB of  SCIENCE, ASCO, ESMO and SNO databases. RESULTS: fourteen randomized clinical trials were identified (7 with  bevacizumab, 2 cilengitide, 1 enzastaurin, 1 dasatinib, 1 vandetanib, 1  temsirolimus, 1 cediranib) including 4330 patients. Antiangiogenic drugs showed  no improvement in overall survival with a pooled HR of 1.00, a trend for an  inferior outcome, in terms of overall survival, was observed in the group of  patients receiving antiangiogenic drug alone compared to cytotoxic drug alone  (HR=1.24, p=0.056). Bevacizumab did not improve overall survival. Twelve trials  (4113 patients) were analyzed for progression-free survival. Among  antiangiogenic drugs, only bevacizumab demonstrated an improvement of  progression-free survival (HR=0.63, p<0.001), both alone (HR=0.60, p=0.003) or  in combination to chemotherapy (HR=0.63; p<0.001), both as first-line treatment  (HR=0.70, p<0.001) or in recurrent disease (HR=0.52, p<0.001). CONCLUSIONS: antiangiogenic drugs did not improve overall survival in  glioblastoma patients, either as first or second-line treatment, and either as  single agent or in combination with chemotherapy. Among antiangiogenic drugs,  only bevacizumab improved progression-free survival regardless of treatment  line, both as single agent or in combination with chemotherapy.', 'PURPOSE: A phase II study of temsirolimus was conducted in children and  adolescents with high-grade glioma, neuroblastoma or rhabdomyosarcoma. PATIENTS AND METHODS: Temsirolimus 75 mg/m(2) was administered once weekly until  disease progression or intolerance. Using the Simon 2-stage design, further  enrolment in each disease cohort required ≥ 2 objective responses within the  first 12 weeks for the first 12 evaluable patients (those who received ≥ 3  temsirolimus doses). RESULTS: Fifty-two heavily pretreated patients with relapsed (12%) or refractory  (88%) disease, median age 8 years (range 1-21 years), were enroled and treated.  One patient with neuroblastoma achieved confirmed partial response within the  first 12 weeks; thus, none of the 3 cohorts met the criterion for continued  enrolment. Disease stabilisation at week 12 was observed in 7 of 17 patients  (41%) with high-grade glioma (5 diffuse pontine gliomas, 1 glioblastoma  multiforme and 1 anaplastic astrocytoma), 6 of 19 (32%) with neuroblastoma and 1  of 16 (6%) with rhabdomyosarcoma (partial response confirmed at week 18). In the  three cohorts, median duration of stable disease or better was 128, 663 and 75  d, respectively. The most common treatment-related adverse events were  thrombocytopaenia, hyperlipidaemia and aesthenia. Pharmacokinetic findings were  similar to those observed in adults. CONCLUSIONS: Temsirolimus administered weekly at the dose of 75 mg/m(2) did not  meet the primary objective efficacy threshold in children with high-grade  glioma, neuroblastoma or rhabdomyosarcoma; however, meaningful prolonged stable  disease merits further evaluation in combination therapy.']]]","Based on the information provided, enzastaurin shows some promise as an effective treatment for glioblastoma. Specifically:

1. It was found to be well-tolerated in a phase II study where median overall survival was 74 weeks and progression-free survival was 36 weeks, comparable to prior studies using erlotinib and significantly better than two other studies using thalidomide or cis-retinoic acid.

2. A positive correlation between O-6-methylguanine-DNA methyltransferase promoter methylation and overall survival was observed.

3. No other biomarker was associated with survival outcome, suggesting potential for targeted treatment.

However, the study was open-label and single-arm, limiting its strength as a definitive proof of efficacy. Further prospective, controlled trials would be needed to fully assess enzastaurin's effectiveness.","[{'Exact': array([  3.61675362,   7.53742007, 202.95039977,   5.74841148,

Have microRNAs been implicated in pharmacogenomics? ,"[[[""MicroRNAs (miRNAs) are short regulatory RNAs that down-regulate gene expression.  They are essential for cell homeostasis and active in many disease states. A  major discovery is the ability of miRNAs to determine the efficacy of drugs,  which has given rise to the field of 'miRNA pharmacogenomics' through  'Pharmaco-miRs'. miRNAs play a significant role in pharmacogenomics by  down-regulating genes that are important for drug function. These interactions  can be described as triplet sets consisting of a miRNA, a target gene and a drug  associated with the gene. We have developed a web server which links miRNA  expression and drug function by combining data on miRNA targeting and  protein-drug interactions. miRNA targeting information derive from both  experimental data and computational predictions, and protein-drug interactions  are annotated by the Pharmacogenomics Knowledge base (PharmGKB). Pharmaco-miR's  input consists of miRNAs, genes and/or drug names and the output consists of  miRNA pharmacogenomic sets or a list of unique associated miRNAs, genes and  drugs. We have furthermore built a database, named Pharmaco-miR Verified Sets  (VerSe), which contains miRNA pharmacogenomic data manually curated from the  literature, can be searched and downloaded via Pharmaco-miR and informs on  trends and generalities published in the field. Overall, we present examples of  how Pharmaco-miR provides possible explanations for previously published  observations, including how the cisplatin and 5-fluorouracil resistance induced  by miR-148a may be caused by miR-148a targeting of the gene KIT. The information  is available at www.Pharmaco-miR.org."", 'Single nucleotide polymorphisms in pre‑microRNA (miRNA) may alter miRNA  expression levels or processing and contribute to susceptibility in a wide range  of diseases. The present study aimed to evaluate the possible association  between rs2910164 and rs3746444 of the pre-miRNA (hsa-mir-146a and hsa-mir-499)  polymorphisms and susceptibility to rheumatoid arthritis (RA) in an Iranian  population. This case-control study was performed on 104\xa0patients with RA and  110\xa0healthy individuals. Tetra amplification refractory mutation  system-polymerase chain reaction was used to genotype the hsa-mir-499 rs3746444  and hsa-mir-146a rs2910164 polymorphisms. The hsa-mir-499 rs3746444 polymorphism  was a risk factor for predisposition to RA in codominant [TT vs. TC: odds ratio  (OR), 2.11; 95% confidence interval (CI), 1.08-4.11; p=0.029; TT vs. CC: OR,  3.88; 95% CI, 1.68-8.98; p=0.002], dominant (TT vs. TC-CC: OR, 2.64; 95% CI, 1.48-4.72; p=0.001) and recessive (TC-CC vs. CC: OR,  3.05; 95% CI, 1.36-6.83; p=0.007) tested inheritance models. In addition, the  rs3746444 C allele was a risk factor for RA (OR, 2.49; 95% CI, 1.63-3.81;  p<0.0001). No significant difference was found between the groups concerning the  rs2910164 polymorphism (χ2=0.348, p=0.841). Our findings demonstrated that the  hsa-mir-499 rs3746444, but not mir-146a rs2910164, polymorphism is associated  with an increased RA risk in a sample of the Iranian population. Larger studies  with different ethnicities are required to validate our findings.', 'Pharmacogenomics, toxicogenomics, and small RNA expression analysis are three of  the most active research topics in the biological, biomedical, pharmaceutical,  and toxicological fields. All of these studies are based on gene expression  analysis, which requires reference genes to reduce the variations derived from  different amounts of starting materials and different efficiencies of RNA  extraction and cDNA synthesis. Thus, accurate normalization to one or several  constitutively expressed reference genes is a prerequisite to valid gene  expression studies. Although selection of reliable reference genes has been  conducted in previous studies in several animals and plants, no research has  been focused on pharmacological targets, and very few studies have had a  toxicological context. More interestingly, no studies have been performed to  identify reference genes for small RNA analysis although small RNA, particularly  microRNA (miRNA)-related research is currently one of the fastest-moving topics.  In this study, using MCF-7 breast cancer cells as a model, we employed  quantitative real-time PCR (qRT-PCR), one of the most reliable methods for gene  expression analysis in many research fields, to evaluate and to determine the  most reliable reference genes for pharmacogenomics and toxicogenomics studies as  well as for small RNA expression analysis. We tested the transcriptional  expression of five protein-coding genes as well as five non-coding genes in  MCF-7 cells treated with five different pharmaceuticals or toxicants [paclitaxel  (PTX), gossypol (GOS), methyl jasmonate (JAS), L-nicotine (NIC), and melamine  (mela)] and analyzed the stability of the selected reference genes by four  different methods: geNorm, NormFinder, BestKeeper, and the comparative ΔCt  method. According to our analysis, a protein-coding gene, hTBCA and four  non-coding genes, hRNU44, hRNU48, hU6, and hRNU47, appear to be the most  reliable reference genes for the five chemical treatments. Similar results were  also obtained in dose-response and time-course assays with gossypol (GOS)  treatment. Our results demonstrated that traditionally used reference genes,  such as 18s RNA, β-actin, and GAPDH, are not reliable reference genes for  pharmacogenomics and toxicogenomics studies. In contrast, hTBCA and small RNAs  are more stable during drug treatment, and they are better reference genes for  pharmacogenomics and toxicogenomics studies. To widely use these genes as  reference genes, these results should be corroborated by studies with other  human cell lines and additional drugs classes and hormonal treatments.', ""Pharmacogenetics and pharmacogenomics are keys to the success of personalized  medicine, prescribing drugs based on a patient's individual genetic and  biological profile. In this review, we will focus on the application of  pharmacogenetics and pharmacogenomics in developing monoclonal antibody (MAb)  therapeutics in oncology. The significance of pharmacogenomics in MAb  therapeutics is highlighted by the association between polymorphisms in Fc  receptors and clinical response to anti-CD20 MAb rituximab (Rituxan) or  anti-ganglioside GD2 MAb 3F8, as well as the potential link between  polymorphisms in HER2 and cardiac toxicity in patients treated with the  anti-HER2 MAb trastuzumab (Herceptin). The dependence on gene copy number or  expression levels of HER2 and epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) for  therapeutic efficacy of trastuzumab and cetuximab (Erbitux), respectively,  supports the importance of selecting suitable patient populations based on their  pharmacogenetic profile. In addition, a better understanding of target mutation  status and biological consequences will benefit MAAb development and may guide  clinical development and use of these innovative therapeutics. The application  of pharmacogenetics and pharmacogenomics in developing MAb therapeutics will be  largely dependent on the discovery of novel surrogate biomarkers and  identification of disease- and therapeutics-relevant polymorphisms. Challenges  and opportunities in biomarker discovery and validation, and in implementing  clinical pharmacogenetics and pharmacogenomics in oncology MAb development and  clinical practice will also be discussed."", ""AIMS: Polymorphisms of genes involved in the pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic  processes underlie the divergent drug responses among individuals. Despite some  successes in identifying these polymorphisms, the candidate gene approach  suffers from insufficient gene coverage whereas the genome-wide association  approach is limited by less than ideal coverage of SNPs in some important genes.  To expand the potential of the candidate approach, we aim to delineate a  comprehensive network of drug-response genes for in-depth genetic studies. MATERIALS & METHODS: Pharmacologically important genes were extracted from  various sources including literatures and web resources. These genes, along with  their homologs and regulatory miRNAs, were organized based on their  pharmacological functions and weighted by literature evidence and confidence  levels. Their coverage was evaluated by analyzing three commercial SNP chips  commonly used for genome-wide association studies: Affymetrix SNP array 6.0,  Illumina HumanHap1M and Illumina Omni. RESULTS: A panel of drug-response genes was constructed, which contains 923  pharmacokinetic genes, 703 pharmacodynamic genes and 720 miRNAs. There are only  16.7% of these genes whose all known SNPs can be directly or indirectly (r(2) >  0.8) captured by the SNP chips with coverage of more than 80%. This is possibly  because these SNPs chips have notably poor performance over rare SNPs and miRNA  genes. CONCLUSION: We have compiled a panel of candidate genes that may be  pharmacologically important. Using this knowledgebase, we are able to  systematically evaluate genes and their variants that govern an individual's  response to a given pharmaceutical therapy. This approach can serve as a  necessary complement to genome-wide associations."", 'microRNAs (miRNAs) represent the most abundant class of gene expression  regulators that bind complementarily to transcripts to repress their translation  or mRNA degradation. These small ( 21-23 nucleotides in length) noncoding RNAs  are derived through a multistep process by miRNA genes located in genomic DNA.  Because miRNAs regulate fundamental cellular functions, their dysregulation  affects a large range of physiological processes, such as development, immune  responses, metabolism, and diseases as well as toxicological outcomes.  Cancer-related miRNAs have been extensively studied; however, the roles of  miRNAs in xenobiotic metabolism and in toxicology have only recently been  explored. This review focuses on the current knowledge of miRNA-dependent  regulation of drug-metabolizing enzymes and nuclear receptors and the associated  potential toxicological implications. The potential modulation of  toxicology-related changes in miRNA expression, the role of miRNA in  immune-mediated drug-induced liver injuries, the use of circulating miRNAs in  body fluids as potential toxicological biomarkers, and the link between  miRNA-related pharmacogenomics and adverse drug reactions are highlighted.', ""Extensive research has shown that aberrant expression of microRNAs (miRNAs)  plays an important role in innate and adaptive immune responses. The rs2910164  polymorphism has been identified as a functional variant, which affects the  transcription and expression level of miR-146a and, thereby, contributes to the  pathogenesis of several inflammatory and autoimmune diseases. To investigate  whether the rs2910164 G/C polymorphism was associated with asthma, systemic  lupus erythematosus (SLE) or juvenile rheumatoid arthritis (JRA), we performed  an association study in a pediatric Mexican cohort. We included 979 pediatric  patients (asthma: 402, SLE: 367 and JRA: 210) and 531 control subjects without  inflammatory or immune diseases. Genotyping was performed using the 5'  exonuclease technique. The genotype distribution of the rs2910164 polymorphism  was in Hardy-Weinberg equilibrium in each group. No significant differences were  detected in the distribution of this polymorphism between cases and controls  (P\u2009=\u20090.108, 0.609 and 0.553 for subjects with asthma, JRA and SLE,  respectively). However, stratification by gender showed a statistically  significant difference between asthmatic and control females, where the C allele  was significantly associated with protection to asthma (odds ratio\u2009=\u20090.694, 95%  confidence interval 0.519-0.929, P\u2009=\u20090.0138). Our results provide evidence that  rs2910164 may play a role in the susceptibility to childhood-onset asthma, but  not SLE or JRA in Mexicans. Further association studies may contribute to  determining the role of miR-146a single-nucleotide polymorphisms in  immune-mediated diseases."", ""Pharmacogenetics (PGX) is the study of drug response as a function of an  individual's DNA. PGX is often viewed as an extension of disease association  genetics, and although this information may be related, it is not the study of  drug response. Although medicines are used to treat diseases, the value of  strategies that identify and incorporate DNA biomarkers associated with clinical  efficacy, or DNA biomarkers for untoward clinical responses, can be applied  directly to pharmaceutical pipelines. The growth of adverse event PGX studies  involving marketed medicines generally uses relatively large numbers of affected  patients, but has been productive. However, the two critical strategies for  pipeline genetics must make use of fewer patients: (1) the early identification  of efficacy signals so that they can be applied early in development for  targeted therapies and (2) identification of safety signals that can  subsequently be validated prospectively during development using the least  number of patients with adverse responses. Assumptions are often made that large  numbers of patients are necessary to recognize PGX hypotheses and to validate  DNA biomarkers. In some ways, pipeline pharmacogenetics may be viewed as the  opposite of current genome-wide scanning designs. The goal is to obtain PGX  signals in as few patients as possible, and then validate PGX hypotheses for  specificity and sensitivity as development trials go forward--not using hundreds  of thousand of markers to detect strong linkage disequilibrium signals in  thousands of patients and their controls. Drug development takes 5-7 years for a  drug candidate to traverse to registration--and this is similar to the timeframe  for validating genetic biomarkers using sequential clinical trials. Two  important examples are discussed, the association of APOE genotypes to the  demonstration of actionable efficacy signals for the use of rosiglitazone for  Alzheimer's disease; and the identification of HLA-B(*)5701 as a highly  sensitive and specific predictive marker for abacavir treated patients who will  develop hypersensitivity syndrome (HSS). The rosiglitazone study prevented  pipeline attrition by changing the interpretation of a critical Phase IIB proof  of concept study (2005) from a failed study, to a positive efficacy response in  a genetically predictable proportion of patients. Now, three years later, a  Phase III program of clinical trials using pharmacogenetic designs is months  away from completion (late08). If successfully registered (early09), millions of  patients could benefit, and efficacy PGX would have achieved its first  prospective block-buster. The use of safety candidate gene association genetics  in patients who received abacavir therapy and developed HSS starting in 1998  culminated in a double blind clinical trial that determined sensitivity > 97%  and specificity >99% in 2007. Clinical consensus panels rapidly recommended  abacavir as the preferred therapy along with HLA-B(*)5701 pre-testing,  immediately increasing the market share of abacavir with respect to other  reverse transcriptases that are associated with there own adverse events.  Targeting of medicines during drug development is now possible, practical, and  profitable."", ""BACKGROUND: The function of microRNAs (miRNAs) depends on the binding of miRNAs  to their target sequences in the 3'UTR of messenger RNAs (mRNAs), which enhances  the degradation of mRNAs and consequently, represses their expression. Single  nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) in the miRNA target sequences may affect or  impair the binding of miRNAs. Studies have shown that SNPs in miRNA target sites  (miR-TS-SNPs) have a great influence on diverse biological functions, including  pharmacogenomics and disease susceptibilities in human. METHODS: High-resolution melting (HRM) analysis was applied for investigating  the allele frequencies of 3 miR-TS-SNPs (PLA2G2A, IL-16, and NOD2) in acute  leukemia. We also compared the genotypes of acute lymphoblastic leukemia  patients at initial diagnosis and complete remission. RESULTS: HRM analysis revealed 3 genotypes (both homozygous and heterozygous) in  the 3 miR-TS-SNPs. The allele frequencies of all 3 miR-TS-SNPs were similar in  normal individuals and patients with acute myelogenous leukemia. Most patients  with acute lymphoblastic leukemia had the same genotypes at initial diagnosis  and complete remission. CONCLUSIONS: Large scale scanning of case-control studies for miR-TS-SNPs may  contribute to the investigation of their roles and pathogenesis mechanisms in  human diseases. Our study showed that HRM analysis can be an efficient tool for  studies of miR-TS-SNPs."", 'Despite a large amount of microRNAs (miRNAs) have been validated to play crucial  roles in human biology and disease, there is little systematic insight into the  nature and scale of the potential synergistic interactions executed by miRNAs  themselves. Here we established an integrated parameter synergy score to  determine miRNA synergy, by combining the two mechanisms for miRNA-miRNA  interactions, miRNA-mediated gene co-regulation and functional association  between target gene products, into one single parameter. Receiver operating  characteristic (ROC) analysis indicated that synergy score accurately identified  the gene ontology-defined miRNA synergy (AUC\u200a=\u200a0.9415, p<0.001). Only a very  small portion of the random miRNA-miRNA combinations generated potent synergy,  implying poor expectancy of widespread synergy. However, targeting more key  genes made two miRNAs more likely to act synergistically. Compared to other  miRNAs, miR-21 was a highly exceptional case due to frequent appearance in the  top synergistic miRNA pairs. This result highlighted its essential role in  coordinating or strengthening physiological and pathological functions of other  miRNAs. The synergistic effect of miR-21 and miR-1 were functionally validated  for their significant influences on myocardial apoptosis, cardiac hypertrophy  and fibrosis. The novel approach established in this study enables easy and  effective identification of condition-restricted potent miRNA synergy simply by  concentrating the available protein interactomics and miRNA-target interaction  data into a single parameter synergy score. Our results may be important for  understanding synergistic gene regulation by miRNAs and may have significant  implications for miRNA combination therapy of cardiovascular disease.']]]","Yes, microRNAs (miRNAs) have been implicated in pharmacogenomics. They play a significant role by down-regulating genes that are important for drug function, forming triplet sets with miRNAs, target genes, and drugs. This interaction helps explain drug resistance and susceptibility, as seen in studies linking miR-148a to cisplatin and 5-fluorouracil resistance.","[{'Exact': array([186.70635784,  -8.11208673,   1.20638545,   0.79602865,

Are piRNAs involved in gene silencing?,"[[['PIWI-interacting small non-coding RNAs (piRNAs) are genetic and epigenetic  regulatory factors in germline cells, where they maintain genome stability, are  involved in RNA silencing and regulate gene expression. We found that the piRNA  biogenesis and effector pathway are present in human breast cancer (BC) cells  and, analyzing smallRNA-Seq data generated from BC cell lines and tumor  biopsies, we identified >100 BC piRNAs, including some very abundant and/or  differentially expressed in mammary epithelial compared to BC cells, where this  was influenced by estrogen or estrogen receptor β, and in cancer respect to  normal breast tissues. A search for mRNAs targeted by the BC piRNome revealed  that eight piRNAs showing a specific expression pattern in breast tumors target  key cancer cell pathways. Evidence of an active piRNA pathway in BC suggests  that these small non-coding RNAs do exert transcriptional and  post-transcriptional gene regulatory actions also in cancer cells.', 'In the Drosophila germline, retrotransposons are silenced by the  PIWI-interacting RNA (piRNA) pathway. piRNA pathway mutations lead to  overexpression and mobilization of retrotransposons in the germline. In  different organisms, small RNAs were shown to be implicated in the  posttranscriptional degradation of mRNA and/or transcriptional repression of the  homologous locus. In Drosophila, the mechanism of piRNA-mediated silencing is  still far from being understood. Transcriptional silencing implies a  piRNA-mediated formation of repressive chromatin which diminishes the  transcriptional capacity of the target locus. Nuclear Run-On (NRO) assay allows  a direct estimation of the density of transcribing polymerases at specific  genomic regions. Here we describe the NRO protocol on Drosophila ovarian tissues  which can be useful for investigation of the transcriptional silencing in the  female germline.', 'In the metazoan germline, piwi proteins and associated piwi-interacting RNAs  (piRNAs) provide a defense system against the expression of transposable  elements. In the cytoplasm, piRNA sequences guide piwi complexes to destroy  complementary transposon transcripts by endonucleolytic cleavage. However, some  piwi family members are nuclear, raising the possibility of alternative pathways  for piRNA-mediated regulation of gene expression. We found that Drosophila Piwi  is recruited to chromatin, colocalizing with RNA polymerase II (Pol II) on  polytene chromosomes. Knockdown of Piwi in the germline increases expression of  transposable elements that are targeted by piRNAs, whereas protein-coding genes  remain largely unaffected. Derepression of transposons upon Piwi depletion  correlates with increased occupancy of Pol II on their promoters. Expression of  piRNAs that target a reporter construct results in a decrease in Pol II  occupancy and an increase in repressive H3K9me3 marks and heterochromatin  protein 1 (HP1) on the reporter locus. Our results indicate that Piwi identifies  targets complementary to the associated piRNA and induces transcriptional  repression by establishing a repressive chromatin state when correct targets are  found.', 'PIWI clade Argonaute proteins silence transposon expression in animal gonads.  Their target specificity is defined by bound ∼23- to 30-nucleotide (nt)  PIWI-interacting RNAs (piRNAs) that are processed from single-stranded precursor  transcripts via two distinct pathways. Primary piRNAs are defined by the  endonuclease Zucchini, while biogenesis of secondary piRNAs depends on  piRNA-guided transcript cleavage and results in piRNA amplification. Here, we  analyze the interdependencies between these piRNA biogenesis pathways in  developing Drosophila ovaries. We show that secondary piRNA-guided target  slicing is the predominant mechanism that specifies transcripts—including those  from piRNA clusters—as primary piRNA precursors and defines the spectrum of  Piwi-bound piRNAs in germline cells. Post-transcriptional silencing in the  cytoplasm therefore enforces nuclear transcriptional target silencing, which  ensures the tight suppression of transposons during oogenesis. As target slicing  also defines the nuclear piRNA pool during mouse spermatogenesis, our findings  uncover an unexpected conceptual similarity between the mouse and fly piRNA  pathways.', ""Although Piwi proteins and Piwi-interacting RNAs (piRNAs) genetically repress  transposable elements (TEs), it is unclear how the highly diverse piRNA  populations direct Piwi proteins to silence TE targets without silencing the  entire transcriptome. To determine the capacity of piRNA-mediated silencing, we  introduced reporter genes into Drosophila OSS cells, which express microRNAs  (miRNAs) and piRNAs, and compared the Piwi pathway to the Argonaute pathway in  gene regulation. Reporter constructs containing several target sites that were  robustly silenced by miRNAs were not silenced to the same degrees by piRNAs.  However, another set of reporters we designed to enable a large number of both  TE-directed and genic piRNAs to bind were robustly silenced by the PIWI/piRNA  complex in OSS cells. These reporters show that a bulk of piRNAs are required to  pair to the reporter's transcripts and not the reporter's DNA sequence to engage  PIWI-mediated silencing. Following our genome-wide study of PIWI-regulated  targets in OSS cells, we assessed candidate gene elements with our reporter  platform. These results suggest TE sequences are the most direct of PIWI  regulatory targets while coding genes are less directly affected by PIWI  targeting. Finally, our study suggests that the PIWI transcriptional silencing  mechanism triggers robust chromatin changes on targets with sufficient piRNA  binding, and preferentially regulates TE transcripts because protein-coding  transcripts lack a threshold of targeting by piRNA populations. This reporter  platform will facilitate future dissections of the PIWI-targeting mechanism."", 'Proteins of the PIWI subfamily Aub and AGO3 associated with the  germline-specific perinuclear granules (nuage) are involved in the silencing of  retrotransposons and other selfish repetitive elements in the Drosophila genome.  PIWI proteins and their 25- to 30-nt PIWI-interacting RNA (piRNAs) are  considered as key participants of the piRNA pathway. Using immunostaining, we  found a large, nuage-associated organelle in the testes, the piNG-body (piRNA  nuage giant body), which was significantly more massive than an ordinary nuage  granule. This body contains known ovarian nuage proteins, including Vasa, Aub,  AGO3, Tud, Spn-E, Bel, Squ, and Cuff, as well as AGO1, the key component of the  microRNA pathway. piNG-bodies emerge at the primary spermatocyte stage of  spermatogenesis during the period of active transcription. Aub, Vasa, and Tud  are located at the periphery of the piNG-body, whereas AGO3 is found in its  core. Mutational analysis revealed that Vasa, Aub, and AGO3 were crucial for  both the maintenance of the piNG-body structure and the silencing of selfish  Stellate repeats. The piNG-body destruction caused by csul mutations that  abolish specific posttranslational symmetrical arginine methylation of PIWI  proteins is accompanied by strong derepression of Stellate genes known to be  silenced via the piRNA pathway.', 'The Piwi-interacting RNA (piRNA) pathway defends animal genomes against the  harmful consequences of transposable element (TE) infection by imposing  small-RNA-mediated silencing. Because silencing is targeted by TE-derived  piRNAs, piRNA production is posited to be central to the evolution of genome  defense. We harnessed genomic data sets from Drosophila melanogaster, including  genome-wide measures of piRNA, mRNA, and genomic abundance, along with estimates  of age structure and risk of ectopic recombination, to address fundamental  questions about the functional and evolutionary relationships between TE  families and their regulatory piRNAs. We demonstrate that mRNA transcript  abundance, robustness of ""ping-pong"" amplification, and representation in piRNA  clusters together explain the majority of variation in piRNA abundance between  TE families, providing the first robust statistical support for the prevailing  model of piRNA biogenesis. Intriguingly, we also discover that the most  transpositionally active TE families, with the greatest capacity to induce  harmful mutations or disrupt gametogenesis, are not necessarily the most  abundant among piRNAs. Rather, the level of piRNA targeting is largely  independent of recent transposition rate for active TE families, but is rapidly  lost for inactive TEs. These observations are consistent with population genetic  theory that suggests a limited selective advantage for host repression of  transposition. Additionally, we find no evidence that piRNA targeting responds  to selection against a second major cost of TE infection: ectopic recombination  between TE insertions.

Aub in ovaries associates with a  variety of Piwi-interacting RNAs (piRNAs) derived from repetitive intergenic  elements including retrotransposons. Here we found that Aub in testes also  associates with various kinds of piRNAs. Although in ovaries Aub-associated  piRNA populations are quite diverse, piRNAs with Aub in testes show a strong  bias. The most abundant piRNAs were those corresponding to antisense transcripts  of Suppressor of Stellate [Su(Ste)] genes known to be involved in Stellate gene  silencing. The second most abundant class was made up of those from chromosome X  and showed strong complementarity to vasa transcripts. Immunopurified Aub-piRNA  complexes from testes displayed activity in cleaving target RNA containing  sequences complementary to Stellate and vasa transcripts.

The mouse PIWI family proteins MILI and MIWI2 are involved in  production of Piwi-interacting RNAs (piRNAs) in fetal male germ cells through a  ping-pong amplification cycle. Expression of retrotransposons is elevated in  MILI- and MIWI2-deficient male germ cells due to defective de novo DNA  methylation, which is presumably caused by impaired piRNA expression. Here, we  report that essentially the same abnormalities are observed in MVH (mouse VASA  homolog)-deficient mice. Comprehensive analysis of piRNAs in MVH-deficient fetal  male germ cells showed that MVH plays crucial roles in the early phase of the  ping-pong amplification cycle.']]]","Yes, piRNAs are involved in gene silencing.

Is methotrexate used for the treatment of Rheumatoid Arthritis (RA)?,"[[['A number of studies show the efficacy of methotrexate (MTX) for rheumatoid  arthritis (RA) in general. However, is there any reason to single this drug out  for early RA? Mechanistically, it probably works differently in RA than in  cancer, at least in part. Thus, in addition to dihydrofolate reductase-related  effects, MTX inhibits aminoimidazocarboxamide transformylase, decreases  leukotriene B4 production, and increases adenosine release at concentrations  achieved with low-dose MTX regimens. Clinically, it is well tolerated over  relatively long periods. Further, a recent meta-analysis of radiology studies  shows that MTX compares favorably with intramuscular gold and is better than  azathioprine. Toxicity remains a concern in treating early RA, particularly as  pulmonary ""hypersensitivity reactions"" continue (1% to 7.6%), infections (both  fungal and perioperative) are documented, and more cirrhosis is found. With all  of the above in mind, the use of MTX seems reasonable but not necessarily  uniformly appropriate and not yet proved for early RA. Studies of MTX in early  RA, particularly in combination with other drugs, are only beginning.', 'Methotrexate (MTX) is the anchor treatment for rheumatoid arthritis (RA) and has  been very thoroughly studied in many different patient populations, as  monotherapy and in combination with various other disease modifying  antirheumatic drugs and biologic agents, as they became available. It has a  well-established safety and efficacy profile and is the preferred first line  agent for RA treatment. Historically, oral (PO) preparations of MTX have been  used in the USA with minimal parenteral (subcutaneous, SC, and intramuscular,  IM) administration. Several shortages of drug availability in a parenteral form  have been possibly one of the reasons for this low level of use. Several studies  have looked at the role of parenteral MTX in RA treatment, and these overall  demonstrate better tolerability, bioavailability, and possible efficacy of MTX  compared with PO preparation.', 'Twenty-nine patients participated in a prospective study of the safety and  efficacy of oral methotrexate in the treatment of refractory rheumatoid  arthritis. Patients received a mean dosage of 12.4 mg weekly over a mean  duration of 29.1 months. All patients had liver biopsies at baseline, 2 years,  and annually thereafter. Patients improved significantly by all clinical  measures of efficacy after 1 month; maximum improvement tended to occur after  approximately 6 months of therapy. Radiographs showed improvement of erosive  disease in 7 of 11 patients measured. There was a significant reduction in mean  prednisone dosage. Four patients required an increase in the dosage of  methotrexate after prolonged therapy, because of declining clinical response.  Toxicity was noted at some time in 26 of 29 patients (90%), but reactions  universally became mild and tolerable after adjustment of the dosage. No  significant hepatotoxicity was found in 60 sequential liver biopsies, although  elevated transaminase levels were noted at some time in 20 of 29 patients (70%).', 'Increasingly, methotrexate (MTX) and sulphasalazine (SASP) are used initially  for second-line therapy of rheumatoid arthritis (RA). Although SASP and MTX are  commonly used, the mechanism(s) by which these drugs control the inflammation  that characterizes RA have remained obscure. Results from my laboratory indicate  that these agents share a mode of action; the anti-inflammatory effects of both  SASP and MTX are due, in both in vitro and in vivo studies, to their capacity to  enhance adenosine release at inflamed sites. This mode of action suggests that  the development of agents that directly alter adenosine metabolism may lead to  new, more effective and safer antirheumatic drugs than those currently  available.', ""Methotrexate is the most common disease-modifying antirheumatic drug (DMARD)  used in the treatment of rheumatoid arthritis (RA). Current evidence supports  its efficacy in the treatment of RA, resulting in improved short-term disease  control and long-term outcomes in terms of radiographic progression. Oral  methotrexate has traditionally been used first-line due to various reasons,  including ease of administration, low cost and easy availability. A methotrexate  dose of >15 mg/week is generally required for disease control but oral  methotrexate may be only partially effective or poorly tolerated in some  patients. The rationale for using subcutaneous (SC) methotrexate is based on its  improved bioavailability at higher doses and better tolerability in some  patients who have side effects when receiving oral methotrexate. Current  guidance advocates 'treating to target', with the aim of inducing remission in  RA patients. In some patients, this can be achieved using methotrexate alone or  in combination with other traditional DMARDs. Patients who have not responded to  two DMARDs, including methotrexate, are eligible for biological therapy as per  current National Institute for Health and Care Excellence (NICE) guidance in the  UK. Biological treatments are expensive and using SC methotrexate can improve  disease control in RA patients, thus potentially avoiding or delaying the  requirement for future biological treatment."", 'Methotrexate (MTX) has been the anchor treatment in rheumatoid arthritis (RA)  over the last 15 years, and is used in combination with biologic agents to  enhance efficacy over the last decade or so. The safety profile of MTX has been  studied over 25 years with very few clinically important adverse events in the  weekly low-doses used for RA treatment. The importance of MTX in earlier and  more aggressive management of RA patients cannot be overstated. MTX courses show  some of the longest continuation rates reported in clinical medicine, due to  both effectiveness and safety. The safety profile of MTX indicates that it is  among the safest of any mediation used for the treatment of any arthritis.  Better information on the effectiveness and safety of weekly-low dose MTX should  be communicated to all health professionals involved in the management of RA  patients.', 'OBJECTIVE: To address the long-term efficacy and toxicity issues related to  methotrexate (MTX) and compare it with other disease-modifying antirheumatic  drugs (DMARDs). METHODS: Review of the international literature on the clinical use of MTX in  rheumatoid arthritis (RA) disease. RESULTS: MTX has emerged as a relatively safe and effective treatment for RA  that compares favorably with other therapies, particularly because of its  considerably longer median drug survival. The toxicity profile of MTX is well  established and includes serious and sometimes fatal liver disease, pneumonitis,  and cytopenias. Hence, regular and careful monitoring of patients taking MTX is  essential, particularly when MTX is combined with other DMARDs. Folate  supplementation can reduce some of the most common side effects of MTX, but it  has not yet been established whether this translates into a reduced risk of  serious disease. Another potential approach to reducing the toxicity of MTX is  therapeutic drug monitoring and dose individualization. However, correlations  between pharmacokinetics and clinical response have been addressed in only a few  studies and with conflicting results. CONCLUSIONS: MTX is an effective DMARD with a relatively safe profile compared  with other therapies. Folate supplementation can significantly reduce the risk  of MTX toxicity. Finally, it is essential that patients be monitored carefully  to reduce the potential serious toxicities of MTX.', 'The association of rheumatoid arthritis (RA) and immune thrombocytopenic purpura  (ITP) has been reported rarely. Methotrexate, which is used for RA treatment,  causes thrombocytopenia. Therefore, in medical practice, physicians avoid using  methotrexate for RA in patients who have both RA and ITP. Here, we report an RA  case that also had ITP, which did not decrease in platelet count after  methotrexate therapy. A 50-year-old woman was diagnosed with diabetes mellitus  in 1990, RA in 1995, and ITP in 2000. She had received hydroxychloroquine for  more than 5 years. She was treated with prednisolone 16 mg/daily between 2006  and 2007, but she discontinued this therapy because of weight gain. Laboratory  findings were not remarkable, except for thrombocytopenia. We started  methotrexate therapy 10 mg per week for treatment of RA, and hydroxychloroquine  therapy was stopped due to nonresponse. The methotrexate dose was increased up  to 15 mg/week. Her complete blood cell count was monitored frequently. We did  not observe any decrease in platelet count, while active arthritis symptoms of  the patient were relieved. This case shows that methotrexate may be used in  patients diagnosed with RA that is associated with ITP under strict monitoring.', 'PURPOSE OF REVIEW: Dramatic improvement seen in the prognosis of rheumatoid  arthritis has been driven by higher expectations, led by newer drugs and more  intensive use of the older drugs. Although methotrexate has retained its place  as the first-line agent, there has been great interest in comparing biologicals  to conventional Disease Modifying Anti Rheumatic Drugs (DMARDs) over the past  few years with the updated guidelines from both the American College of  Rheumatology and European League Against Rheumatism. We have tried to critically  summarize the findings of some landmark trials that compare these two  approaches. RECENT FINDINGS: Treatment of Early Rheumatoid Arthritis, The Swedish  Pharmacotherapy study and Rheumatoid Arthritis Comparison of Active Therapies  are landmark trials that were designed to compare strategies using biologicals  vs. conventional DMARDs. We will review the safety and efficacy data from these  three trials here and also briefly the important cost differential. CONCLUSION: Methotrexate should be the first-line therapy for most rheumatoid  arthritis patients and will produce the desired results in greater than  one-third of the patients. When methotrexate is not adequate, triple DMARD  therapy should be added which will result in control of approximately another  one-third of the patients. Ultimately, and usually before 1 year of disease, the  remainder of patients will require biological therapies usually added to  conventional DMARDs. There is no evidence that this step-up approach results in  any long-term disadvantage and good evidence that it results in substantial cost  savings.', 'We present a case of a 67-year-old Japanese man with a serious oropharyngeal  ulceration that at first seemed to be destructive malignant lymphoma or  oropharyngeal carcinoma. We suspected methotrexate (MTX)-associated  lymphoproliferative disorder (LPD) induced by MTX treatment for rheumatoid  arthritis (RA). About 3 weeks after simple discontinuation of MTX, complete  regression of the disease was observed, confirming our diagnosis.']]]","Yes, methotrexate (MTX) is used for the treatment of Rheumatoid Arthritis (RA).

Which cells express CIDEC protein in humans?,"[[['White adipose tissue (WAT) functions as an energy reservoir where excess  circulating fatty acids are transported to WAT, converted to triglycerides, and  stored as unilocular lipid droplets. Fat-specific protein 27 (FSP27, CIDEC in  humans) is a lipid-coating protein highly expressed in mature white adipocytes  that contributes to unilocular lipid droplet formation. However, the influence  of FSP27 in adipose tissue on whole-body energy homeostasis remains unclear.  Mice with adipocyte-specific disruption of the Fsp27 gene (Fsp27(ΔAd)) were  generated using an aP2-Cre transgene with the Cre/LoxP system. Upon high-fat  diet feeding, Fsp27(ΔAd) mice were resistant to weight gain. In the small WAT of  these mice, small adipocytes containing multilocular lipid droplets were  dispersed. The expression levels of the genes associated with mitochondrial  abundance and brown adipocyte identity were increased, and basal lipolytic  activities were significantly augmented in adipocytes isolated from Fsp27(ΔAd)  mice compared with the Fsp27(F/F) counterparts. The impaired fat-storing  function in Fsp27(ΔAd) adipocytes and the resultant lipid overflow from WAT led  to marked hepatosteatosis, dyslipidemia, and systemic insulin resistance in  high-fat diet-treated Fsp27(ΔAd) mice. These results demonstrate a critical role  for FSP27 in the storage of excess fat in WAT with minimizing ectopic fat  accumulation that causes insulin-resistant diabetes and non-alcoholic fatty  liver disease. This mouse model may be useful for understanding the significance  of fat-storing properties of white adipocytes and the role of local FSP27 in  whole-body metabolism and estimating the pathogenesis of human partial  lipodystrophy caused by CIDEC mutations.', 'The hepatic expression of the cell death-inducing DNA fragmentation factor  A-like effector family (CIDEA, CIDEB, and CIDEC) genes is markedly upregulated  in mouse models of obesity. We evaluated the expression of CIDE genes in liver  of obese human subjects undergoing gastric bypass surgery (GBS), at the time of  surgery and again 1 year later when subjects had lost 37.6 +/- 1.4% of their  initial body weight. At the time of GBS, the expression of CIDEA (r(2) = 0.20, P  = 0.04) and CIDEC (r(2) = 0.32, P = 0.01) was strongly correlated with BMI,  whereas CIDEB was not (r(2) = 0.01, P = 0.81). One year after surgery, CIDEC  expression had declined over 60% (P = 0.02), whereas CIDEA expression did not  change (P = 0.20). These data demonstrate that, consistent with previous studies  conducted in rodents, hepatic expression of CIDEA and CIDEC, but not CIDEB, is  increased in obese humans. Moreover, the hepatic expression of CIDEC is  downregulated by marked weight loss.', 'Storage of energy as triglyceride in large adipose-specific lipid droplets is a  fundamental need in all mammals. Efficient sequestration of fat in adipocytes  also prevents fatty acid overload in skeletal muscle and liver, which can impair  insulin signaling. Here we report that the Cide domain-containing protein Cidea,  previously thought to be a mitochondrial protein, colocalizes around lipid  droplets with perilipin, a regulator of lipolysis. Cidea-GFP greatly enhances  lipid droplet size when ectopically expressed in preadipocytes or COS cells.  These results explain previous findings showing that depletion of Cidea with  RNAi markedly elevates lipolysis in human adipocytes. Like perilipin, Cidea and  the related lipid droplet protein Cidec/FSP27 are controlled by peroxisome  proliferator-activated receptor gamma (PPARgamma). Treatment of lean or obese  mice with the PPARgamma agonist rosiglitazone markedly up-regulates Cidea  expression in white adipose tissue (WAT), increasing lipid deposition.  Strikingly, in both omental and s.c. WAT from BMI-matched obese humans,  expression of Cidea, Cidec/FSP27, and perilipin correlates positively with  insulin sensitivity (HOMA-IR index). Thus, Cidea and other lipid droplet  proteins define a novel, highly regulated pathway of triglyceride deposition in  human WAT. The data support a model whereby failure of this pathway results in  ectopic lipid accumulation, insulin resistance, and its associated comorbidities  in humans.', 'Cell death-inducing DFFA-like effector c (CIDEC) protein, also known as fat  specific protein 27 (Fsp27), is localized to lipid droplets. CIDEC protein is  required for unilocular lipid droplet formation and optimal energy storage in  addition to controlling lipid metabolism in adipocytes and hepatocytes. Research  found that Ad-36 could induce lipid droplets in the cultured skeletal muscle  cells and this process may be mediated by promoting CIDEC expression. The  content of intermuscular fat is an important index for evaluation of beef  quality, so the CIDEC gene appeared to be a candidate gene for regulation of  intermuscular fat, however similar research for the bovine CIDEC gene is  lacking. This paper examined the tissue expression profile of CIDEC gene in  cattle using real-time RT-PCR to suggest that bovine CIDEC is highly expressed  in adipose tissue. In addition, the Bovine CIDEC gene was cloned and inserted  into the eukaryotic expression vector pET-28a(+), whereupon recombinant bovine  CIDEC protein was induced and identified by Western-blot. A phylogenetic  analysis showed that the animo acid sequence of bovine CIDEC was closer to  mammalian CIDEC than rasorial CIDEC. We found ten single nucleotide  polymorphisms sites (SNPs) in bovine CIDEC gene, of which SNP 2, 3, 4, 6 and 9,  and SNP 8 and 10 were in complete linkage disequilibrium, respectively. SNP 1, 2  and 10 were used in further haplotype studies. Eight different haplotypes were  identified in 973 cattle, of which haplotype 8 predominated with frequencies  ranging from 42.90 to 54.30\xa0%. This research provides a basis for future  functional studies of CIDEC in cattle.', 'Fat specific protein 27 (FSP27) was originally isolated by screen for genes  specifically expressed in fully differentiated mouse adipocytes. FSP27 and cell  death-inducing DFF45-like effector C (CIDEC), the human homologue of FSP27,  belong to the CIDE family. The FSP27 in adipocytes was recently reported to be a  lipid droplet (LD)-associated protein, that promotes the formation of unilocular  LDs. An FSP27 knockout mouse demonstrated lean phenotypes with atrophic adipose  tissue as a result of high-energy expenditure; this mouse line was also  resistant to diet-induced obesity and insulin resistance. Interestingly, FSP27  was also expressed in the steatoic liver of a type II diabetes model mouse. The  expression of FSP27 was markedly decreased in livers lacking the nuclear  receptor peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor gamma. Forced expression of  FSP27 in hepatocytes in vitro or in vivo led to an increase of LD through  increased triglyceride levels. The current status of the physiological roles of  FSP27/CIDEC in adipose tissue and liver are discussed along with its  significance as a factor involved in the development of metabolic disorders.', 'BACKGROUND & AIMS: Alcoholic steatohepatitis (ASH) is the progressive form of  alcoholic liver disease and may lead to cirrhosis and hepatocellular carcinoma.  We studied mouse models and human tissues to identify molecules associated with  ASH progression and focused on the mouse fat-specific protein 27 (FSP-27)/human  cell death-inducing DFF45-like effector C (CIDEC) protein, which is expressed in  white adipose tissues and promotes formation of fat droplets. METHODS: C57BL/6N mice or mice with hepatocyte-specific disruption of Fsp27  (Fsp27(Hep-/-) mice) were fed the Lieber-Decarli ethanol liquid diet (5%  ethanol) for 10 days to 12 weeks, followed by 1 or multiple binges of ethanol (5  or 6 g/kg) during the chronic feeding. Some mice were given an inhibitor  (GW9662) of peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor γ (PPARG). Adenoviral  vectors were used to express transgenes or small hairpin (sh) RNAs in cultured  hepatocytes and in mice. Liver tissue samples were collected from ethanol-fed  mice or from 31 patients with alcoholic hepatitis (AH) with biopsy-proved ASH  and analyzed histologically and immunohistochemically and by transcriptome,  immunoblotting, and real-time PCR analyses. RESULTS: Chronic-plus-binge ethanol feeding of mice, which mimics the drinking  pattern of patients with AH, produced severe ASH and mild fibrosis. Microarray  analyses revealed similar alterations in expression of many hepatic genes in  ethanol-fed mice and humans with ASH, including up-regulation of mouse Fsp27  (also called Cidec) and human CIDEC. Fsp27(Hep-/-) mice and mice given  injections of adenovirus-Fsp27shRNA had markedly reduced ASH following  chronic-plus-binge ethanol feeding. Inhibition of PPARG and cyclic  AMP-responsive element binding protein H (CREBH) prevented the increases in  Fsp27α and FSP27β mRNAs, respectively, and reduced liver injury in this  chronic-plus-binge ethanol feeding model. Overexpression of FSP27 and ethanol  exposure had synergistic effects in inducing production of mitochondrial  reactive oxygen species and damage to hepatocytes in mice. Hepatic CIDEC mRNA  expression was increased in patients with AH and correlated with the degree of  hepatic steatosis and disease severity including mortality. CONCLUSIONS: In mice, chronic-plus-binge ethanol feeding induces ASH that mimics  some histological and molecular features observed in patients with AH. Hepatic  expression of FSP27/CIDEC is highly up-regulated in mice following  chronic-plus-binge ethanol feeding and in patients with AH; this up-regulation  contributes to alcohol-induced liver damage.', 'Human adipocytes express high levels of two distinct lipid droplet proteins, fat  specific protein 27 (FSP27; also called CIDEC), a member of the CIDE family, and  perilipin1 (PLIN1), a member of the PAT family. Both proteins play a role in fat  metabolism in adipocytes, but how they interact is not known. Our present study  demonstrates that FSP27 and PLIN1 co-localize and interact in cultured human  primary adipocytes. We also found that the C-terminal domain of FSP27, aa  120-220, interacts with PLIN1. Individual expression of exogenous FSP27 or PLIN1  increased triglyceride content and decreased glycerol release (a measure of  lipolysis), but co-expression of both proteins did not further increase  triglyceride content or decrease lipolysis in human adipocytes. However, the  combination of PLIN1 and FSP27 increased the average size of lipid droplets or  caused the formation of unilocular adipocytes. Our data suggest that FSP27  interacts with PLIN1 to regulate lipid droplet size in human adipocytes in a  concerted manner.', 'Storage of energy as triglyceride in large adipose-specific lipid droplets is a  fundamental need in all mammals. Efficient sequestration of fat in adipocytes  also prevents fatty acid overload in skeletal muscle and liver, which can impair  insulin signaling. Here we report that the Cide domain-containing protein Cidea,  previously thought to be a mitochondrial protein, colocalizes around lipid  droplets with perilipin, a regulator of lipolysis. Cidea-GFP greatly enhances  lipid droplet size when ectopically expressed in preadipocytes or COS cells.  These results explain previous findings showing that depletion of Cidea with  RNAi markedly elevates lipolysis in human adipocytes. Like perilipin, Cidea and  the related lipid droplet protein Cidec/FSP27 are controlled by peroxisome  proliferator-activated receptor gamma (PPARgamma). Treatment of lean or obese  mice with the PPARgamma agonist rosiglitazone markedly up-regulates Cidea  expression in white adipose tissue (WAT), increasing lipid deposition.  Strikingly, in both omental and s.c. WAT from BMI-matched obese humans,  expression of Cidea, Cidec/FSP27, and perilipin correlates positively with  insulin sensitivity (HOMA-IR index). Thus, Cidea and other lipid droplet  proteins define a novel, highly regulated pathway of triglyceride deposition in  human WAT. The data support a model whereby failure of this pathway results in  ectopic lipid accumulation, insulin resistance, and its associated comorbidities  in humans.', 'Fat-specific protein 27 (FSP27)/CIDEC was initially identified by its  upregulation in TA1 adipogenesis and is one of three cell death-inducing  DFF45-like effector (CIDE) family proapoptotic proteins. Ectopic expression of  CIDEs promotes apoptosis of mammalian cells. On the other hand, FSP27 has very  recently been illustrated to regulate lipid droplet size and promote lipid  storage in adipocytes. Regulation of endogenous FSP27 expression is unknown. We  assessed the FSP27 transcript level in the well-characterized 3T3-L1 in vitro  adipocyte differentiation model and found its emergence parallels the  adipocyte-enriched transcript adipocyte fatty acid binding protein and stearoyl  Co-A desaturase 1. Furthermore, FSP27 is a differentiation-dependent transcript  in adipogenesis of primary rodent and human preadipocytes and in brown  adipogenesis. The FSP27 transcript is inversely regulated by TNF-alpha and  insulin, consistent with an antilipolytic function. It is nearly abolished with  a 4-h exposure of 3T3-L1 adipocytes to 10 ng/ml TNF-alpha, while treatment with  100 nM insulin increased the FSP27 transcript eightfold. In the latter case  LY-294002 blocked this response, indicating involvement of phosphatidylinositol  3-kinase signals. Northern blot analysis of murine tissues indicated exclusive  expression of FSP27 in white and brown adipose tissue; however, a dramatic  upregulation occurred in the liver of ob/ob mice. Ectopic expression of murine  FSP27 in 293T cells and in 3T3-L1 preadipocytes led to the appearance of key  apoptotic hallmarks and cell death. However, despite the upregulation for FSP27  in adipogenesis, we failed to detect DNA laddering indicative of apoptosis in  3T3-L1 adipocytes. This suggests that adipogenesis is accompanied by decreased  susceptibility to the proapoptotic effects of FSP27. Overall, our findings  support roles for FSP27 in cell death and in adipocyte function.', 'FSP27 [cell death-inducing DFFA-like effector c (CIDEC) in humans] is a protein  associated with lipid droplets that downregulates the fatty acid oxidation (FAO)  rate when it is overexpressed. However, little is known about its physiological  role in liver. Here, we show that fasting regulates liver expression of Fsp27 in  a time-dependent manner. Thus, during the initial stages of fasting, a maximal  induction of 800-fold was achieved, whereas during the later phase of fasting,  Fsp27 expression decreased. The early response to fasting can be explained by a  canonical PKA-CREB-CRTC2 signaling pathway because: i) CIDEC expression was  induced by forskolin, ii) Fsp27 promoter activity was increased by CREB, and  iii) Fsp27 expression was upregulated in the liver of Sirt1 knockout animals.  Interestingly, pharmacological (etomoxir) or genetic (Hmgcs2 interference)  inhibition of the FAO rate increases the in vivo expression of Fsp27 during  fasting. Similarly, CIDEC expression was upregulated in HepG2 cells by either  etomoxir or HMGCS2 interference. Our data indicate that there is a kinetic  mechanism of autoregulation between short- and long-term fasting, by which free  FAs delivered to the liver during early fasting are accumulated/exported by  FSP27/CIDEC, whereas over longer periods of fasting, they are degraded in the  mitochondria through the carnitine palmitoyl transferase system.']]]",Human adipocytes express CIDEC protein.,"[{'Exact': array([ 1.70769028,  0.56040961,  2.44403513, -0.03083043,  1.51546397,

Which are the problems associated with the use of PD-L1 as immunotherapy biomarker?,"[[['INTRODUCTION: The prominent immune checkpoint molecule, programmed cell death  ligand-1 (PD-L1), is the object of increasing attention. Here, we report a  meta-analysis investigating the safety and efficacy of durvalumab (MEDI4736), an  inhibitor of PD-L1, in various solid tumors. METHODS: A systematic search of PubMed, Embase, and related articles was  performed. Safety data were analyzed using Comprehensive Meta-Analysis software  program version 2. Ultimately, 17 studies with 1,529 patients were included in  our analysis. RESULTS: The major adverse events associated with durvalumab were pruritus and  fatigue, while pruritus, increased alanine transaminase, and increased aspartate  aminotransferase were common among patients treated with a combination of  durvalumab and tremelimumab. Higher PD-L1 expression was associated with a  superior objective response rate. CONCLUSION: Durvalumab is safe in patients with many solid cancers and, in  combination with tremelimumab, it has a tolerable safety profile and is  associated with improved prognosis. PD-L1 expression is a biomarker of the  efficacy of durvalumab.', 'INTRODUCTION: The functional aspects of programmed death 1 (PD-1) and PD ligand  1 (PD-L1) immune checkpoints in malignant mesothelioma have not been studied. METHODS: Tumor samples from 65 patients with mesothelioma were evaluated for  PD-L1 expression by immunohistochemistry, and its prognostic significance was  examined. Malignant effusions from patients with pleural and peritoneal  mesothelioma were evaluated for PD-1-positive and PD-L1-positive infiltrating  lymphocytes and their role in inducing PD-L1 expression in tumor cells.  Antibody-dependent cellular cytotoxicity (ADCC) of avelumab, a fully humanized  immunoglobulin G1 anti PD-L1 antibody against primary mesothelioma cell lines,  was evaluated in presence of autologous and allogeneic natural killer cells. RESULTS: Of 65 pleural and peritoneal mesothelioma tumors examined, 41 (63%)  were PD-L1-positive, which was associated with slightly inferior overall  survival compared to patients with PD-L1-negative tumors (median 23.0 versus  33.3 months, p\xa0= 0.35). The frequency of PD-L1 expression was similar in  patients with pleural and peritoneal mesothelioma, with 62% and 64% of samples  testing positive, respectively. In nine mesothelioma effusion samples evaluated,  the fraction of cells expressing PD-L1 ranged from 12% to 83%. In seven patients  with paired malignant effusion and peripheral blood mononuclear cell (PBMC)  samples, PD-L1 expression was significantly higher on CD3-positive T cells  present in malignant effusions as compared with PBMCs (p\xa0= 0.016). In addition,  the numbers of CD14-positive PD-1-positive cells were increased in malignant  effusions compared with PBMCs (p\xa0= 0.031). The lymphocytes present in malignant  effusions recognized autologous tumor cells and induced interferon-γ-mediated  PD-L1 expression on the tumor cell surface. Of the three primary mesothelioma  cell lines tested, two were susceptible to avelumab-mediated ADCC in the  presence of autologous natural killer cells. CONCLUSIONS: Most pleural as well as peritoneal mesotheliomas express PD-L1.  Malignant effusions in this disease are characterized by the presence of tumor  cells and CD3-positive T cells that highly express PD-L1. In addition,  mesothelioma tumor cells are susceptible to ADCC by the anti-PD-L1 antibody  avelumab.', 'AIM: The treatment of non-small-cell lung cancer has changed after the  development of the immune checkpoint inhibitors. Although the most studied  biomarker is PD-L1 expression, its clinical significance is still debatable. In  this article, we show the updated survival analysis of all published data. METHODS: We searched in network and conference data sources for relevant  clinical studies of immunotherapy for non-small-cell lung cancer that assessed  the PD-L1 expression even as an exploratory analysis. The updated survival  hazard ratios (HR) were included in the analysis. RESULTS: 14 studies with 2857 patients were included (2019 treated with  immunotherapy). The response rate was as higher among PD-L1-positive patients  (RR: 2.19, 95% CI: 1.63-2.94). PD-L1 expression was also related to better  progression-free survival (HR: 0.69, 95% CI: 0.57-0.85) and better overall  survival (HR: 0.77, 95% CI: 0.67-0.89). CONCLUSION: PD-L1 overexpression predicts activity as well as better survival  for patients treated with immune checkpoint inhibitors.', 'The sixth ""Melanoma Bridge Meeting"" took place in Naples, Italy, December  1st-4th, 2015. The four sessions at this meeting were focused on: (1) molecular  and immune advances; (2) combination therapies; (3) news in immunotherapy; and  4) tumor microenvironment and biomarkers. Recent advances in tumor biology and  immunology has led to the development of new targeted and immunotherapeutic  agents that prolong progression-free survival (PFS) and overall survival (OS) of  cancer patients. Immunotherapies in particular have emerged as highly successful  approaches to treat patients with cancer including melanoma, non-small cell lung  cancer (NSCLC), renal cell carcinoma (RCC), bladder cancer, and Hodgkin\'s  disease. Specifically, many clinical successes have been using checkpoint  receptor blockade, including T cell inhibitory receptors such as cytotoxic  T-lymphocyte-associated antigen 4 (CTLA-4) and the programmed cell death-1  (PD-1) and its ligand PD-L1. Despite demonstrated successes, responses to  immunotherapy interventions occur only in a minority of patients. Attempts are  being made to improve responses to immunotherapy by developing biomarkers.  Optimizing biomarkers for immunotherapy could help properly select patients for  treatment and help to monitor response, progression and resistance that are  critical challenges for the immuno-oncology (IO) field. Importantly, biomarkers  could help to design rational combination therapies. In addition, biomarkers may  help to define mechanism of action of different agents, dose selection and to  sequence drug combinations. However, biomarkers and assays development to guide  cancer immunotherapy is highly challenging for several reasons: (i) multiplicity  of immunotherapy agents with different mechanisms of action including  immunotherapies that target activating and inhibitory T cell receptors (e.g.,  CTLA-4, PD-1, etc.); adoptive T cell therapies that include tissue infiltrating  lymphocytes (TILs), chimeric antigen receptors (CARs), and T cell receptor (TCR)  modified T cells; (ii) tumor heterogeneity including changes in antigenic  profiles over time and location in individual patient; and (iii) a variety of  immune-suppressive mechanisms in the tumor microenvironment (TME) including T  regulatory cells (Treg), myeloid derived suppressor cells (MDSC) and  immunosuppressive cytokines. In addition, complex interaction of tumor-immune  system further increases the level of difficulties in the process of biomarkers  development and their validation for clinical use. Recent clinical trial results  have highlighted the potential for combination therapies that include  immunomodulating agents such as anti-PD-1 and anti-CTLA-4. Agents targeting  other immune inhibitory (e.g., Tim-3) or immune stimulating (e.g., CD137)  receptors on T cells and other approaches such as adoptive cell transfer are  tested for clinical efficacy in melanoma as well. These agents are also being  tested in combination with targeted therapies to improve upon shorter-term  responses thus far seen with targeted therapy. Various locoregional  interventions that demonstrate promising results in treatment of advanced  melanoma are also integrated with immunotherapy agents and the combinations with  cytotoxic chemotherapy and inhibitors of angiogenesis are changing the evolving  landscape of therapeutic options and are being evaluated to prevent or delay  resistance and to further improve survival rates for melanoma patients\'  population. This meeting\'s specific focus was on advances in immunotherapy and  combination therapy for melanoma. The importance of understanding of melanoma  genomic background for development of novel therapies and biomarkers for  clinical application to predict the treatment response was an integral part of  the meeting. The overall emphasis on biomarkers supports novel concepts toward  integrating biomarkers into personalized-medicine approach for treatment of  patients with melanoma across the entire spectrum of disease stage. Translation  of the knowledge gained from the biology of tumor microenvironment across  different tumors represents a bridge to impact on prognosis and response to  therapy in melanoma. We also discussed the requirements for pre-analytical and  analytical as well as clinical validation process as applied to biomarkers for  cancer immunotherapy. The concept of the fit-for-purpose marker validation has  been introduced to address the challenges and strategies for analytical and  clinical validation design for specific assays.', 'PURPOSE: Promising results in the treatment of non-small cell lung cancer  (NSCLC) have been seen with agents targeting immune checkpoints, such as  programmed cell death 1 (PD-1) or programmed death ligand-1 (PD-L1). However,  only a select group of patients respond to these interventions. The  identification of biomarkers that predict clinical benefit to immune checkpoint  blockade is critical to successful clinical translation of these agents. METHODS: We conducted an integrated analysis of three independent large  datasets, including The Cancer Genome Atlas of lung adenocarcinoma and two  datasets from MD Anderson Cancer Center (Houston, TX), Profiling of Resistance  Patterns and Oncogenic Signaling Pathways in Evaluation of Cancers of the Thorax  (named PROSPECT) and Biomarker-Integrated Approaches of Targeted Therapy for  Lung Cancer Elimination (named BATTLE-1). Comprehensive analysis of mRNA gene  expression, reverse-phase protein array, IHC, and correlation with clinical data  were performed. RESULTS: Epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT) is highly associated with an  inflammatory tumor microenvironment in lung adenocarcinoma, independent of tumor  mutational burden. We found immune activation coexistent with elevation of  multiple targetable immune checkpoint molecules, including PD-L1, PD-L2, PD-1,  TIM-3, B7-H3, BTLA, and CTLA-4, along with increases in tumor infiltration by  CD4(+)Foxp3(+) regulatory T cells in lung adenocarcinomas that displayed an EMT  phenotype. Furthermore, we identify B7-H3 as a prognostic marker for NSCLC. CONCLUSIONS: The strong association between EMT status and an inflammatory tumor  microenvironment with elevation of multiple targetable immune checkpoint  molecules warrants further investigation of using EMT as a predictive biomarker  for immune checkpoint blockade agents and other immunotherapies in NSCLC and  possibly a broad range of other cancers. Clin Cancer Res; 22(14); 3630-42. ©2016  AACRSee related commentary by Datar and Schalper, p. 3422.', 'BACKGROUND: Carcinosarcomas of the gynecologic tract, also known as malignant  mixed Müllerian tumors, are aggressive neoplasms with a high recurrence rate and  poor prognosis. Despite advances in adjuvant therapies in recent years, the  prognosis of these tumors has not improved. In fact, there are currently no  consensus guidelines for the treatment of these neoplasms and the search for  targetable biomarkers has not been successful so far. Programmed death-ligand 1  (PD-L1) has emerged as a potential target for therapeutics in a number of  malignant tumors, including melanoma, lung, and colorectal cancer. In normal  conditions, PD-L1 is thought to promote immune homeostasis via a number of  pathways, but mainly through downregulation of cytotoxic T cells. In some human  neoplasms, however, overexpression of PD-L1 by tumor cells has been observed,  which can modulate the immune system to allow cancer cells to evade host  response. As this marker could potentially be a therapeutic target for these  tumors, the immunohistochemical expression of PD-L1 in a group of  carcinosarcomas was evaluated in the present study. MATERIAL AND METHODS: Twenty-nine cases of gynecologic carcinosarcomas were  analyzed, corresponding to tumors originating from the uterus (25), ovary (2),  fallopian tube (1), and pelvic epithelium (1). Immunohistochemistry for PD-L1  was performed on paraffin sections and the staining results were assessed  semiquantitatively in both epithelial and mesenchymal components of each tumor. RESULTS: Positive membranous staining for PD-L1 was detected in 25/29 tumors  (86%). The epithelial components were strongly positive in 19/29 (65%) and  weakly positive in 6/29 tumors (21%). The mesenchymal elements were strongly  positive in 8/29 (27%) and weakly positive in 3/29 tumors (10%). With exception  of 1, all tumors with positive sarcomatous components had staining of the  carcinomatous element. Four tumors were negative for PD-L1 in both components. CONCLUSIONS: This study shows that PD-L1 is expressed by the majority of  carcinosarcomas, predominantly in the epithelial components. This is  particularly important as most locoregional recurrences and distant metastases  are of epithelial origin. This finding may serve as a basis for possible  therapeutic approaches using antibodies that have already shown significant  value in a number of other malignant tumors.', ""Programmed death-1 receptor (PD-1)/its ligand (PD-L1) antibodies have changed  the landscape in oncology in 2013. The most mature results have been obtained in  advanced melanoma patients. They indicate important response rates and high  quality responses or prolonged duration. Also in renal cancer and in lung cancer  remarkable activity has been demonstrated. Thus it is clear that these  antibodies have a very broad potential and trials in many tumour types are being  initiated. Breaking tolerance at the tumour site is a potent phenomenon and the  potential for synergy with other checkpoint inhibitors such as ipilimumab have  also been demonstrated in 2013. Long term tumour control now seems achievable  and thus the concept of a clinical cure is emerging by modulation of the immune  system. These antibodies bring immunotherapy to the forefront and indicate that  immune-modulation will be a key component of therapeutic strategies from now on.  Because of all these reasons PD-1/PD-L1 antibodies are considered 'drug of the  year'."", 'BACKGROUND: Lung cancer is the most common cause of cancer-related death among  males and the second leading cause among females globally. Checkpoint inhibitors  re-engage the immune system to fight cancer. This review evaluates phase III  data on the use of checkpoint inhibitors in the treatment of advanced NSCLC and  addresses PD-L1 expression in predicting efficacy. METHODS: Six phase III clinical trials investigating checkpoint inhibitors for  NSCLC were identified through a search of PubMed (to November 15, 2016) and  conference databases, with findings updated from a directed search of eligible  studies conducted in January 2018. RESULTS: Significant reductions in the risk of death ranging from 27% to 41% and  were observed second-line and beyond. A relationship between PD-L1 expression  and survival was apparent in most trials with optimal benefit for the highest  expression levels (≥50%). Benefit was also observed at low or no PD-L1  expression levels and in third-line in some studies. Significantly improved PFS  was observed for pembrolizumab at high PD-L1 expression levels (≥50%)  first-line. Immune-related adverse events associated with checkpoint inhibitors  are tolerable and rates of pneumonitis may be lower among PD-L1 inhibitors. Use  of checkpoint inhibitors for tumors with driver mutations should only be  considered after all appropriate targeted therapy and chemotherapy have been  exhausted. PD-L1 testing presents a valuable tool to guide treatment sequencing  and we recommend use of agent-specific PD-L1 tests and respective scoring  systems until a standardized, convenient and broadly applicable test is  identified. CONCLUSIONS: Checkpoint inhibitors represent a major advance in the treatment of  advanced NSCLC and PD-L1 status can inform treatment decisions.', 'Triple negative breast cancer (TNBC) has an aggressive clinical behaviour, with  a poorer prognosis compared to other subtypes. Recently, tumor-infiltrating  lymphocytes (TILs) have been proposed as a predictive biomarker for a better  clinical outcome and pathological response (pR) after neoadjuvant chemotherapy  (NACT) in TNBC. These data confirm the role of the immune system in the  neoplastic progression and in the response to therapy. We performed a  retrospective analysis of 54 pre-NACT biopsies of TNBC and compared both the  percentage of stromal TILs and the degree of PD-L1 expression with the extent of  pR to standard NACT. A pathological complete response (pCR) was achieved in 35%  of cases. Univariate analysis showed (i) a significant association between PD-L1  expression in ≥25% of neoplastic cells and the achievement of a pCR (p = 0.024);  (ii) a significantly higher frequency of pCR in cases showing ≥50% stromal TILs  (p < 0.001). However in the multivariate analysis only PD-L1 expression on tumor  cells remained significantly associated with pCR (OR = 1,13; 95% CI 1,01-1,27),  suggesting that the expression of this biomarker could be associated with a  subpopulation of TNBC more likely to respond to chemotherapy. These data need to  be confirmed by larger studies.', 'Drugs that target the programmed cell death-1 (PD-1) receptor have shown  promising antitumor activity in clinical trials, but it is not clear whether  expression of the ligand PD-L1 is a biomarker for response. Increasingly,  researchers say that PD-L1 expression is just one of many variables that may  affect response to PD-1 blockade.']]]","Based on the provided context, some problems associated with the use of PD-L1 as an immunotherapy biomarker include:

1. **Complex Interactions**: PD-L1 expression can vary within the tumor microenvironment, making it difficult to consistently predict response.
2. **Tumor Heterogeneity**: Different regions of the same tumor may have varying levels of PD-L1 expression, complicating its use as a reliable biomarker.
3. **Multiple Mechanisms**: PD-L1 is part of a broader network of immune checkpoints, and its expression does not necessarily correlate with the effectiveness of PD-1/PD-L1 inhibitors alone.
4. **Variable Clinical Response**: While PD-L1 expression is often associated with better outcomes, not all patients with high PD-L1 expression respond positively to treatment.
5. **Challenges in Validation**: Developing and validating PD-L1 biomarkers for clinical use is challenging due to the complexity of the tumor microenvironment and the need for robust analytical and clinical validation processes","[{'Exact': array([ 8.89257661,  3.40277107,  0.10559633, 69.14496132,  9.30626163,

Is tirilazad effective for treatment of aneurysmal subarachnoid haemorrhage?,"[[[""BACKGROUND: Corticosteroids, particularly dexamethasone, are commonly used for  treatments in patients with subarachnoid haemorrhage (SAH) and primary  intracerebral haemorrhage (PICH) despite the lack of evidence. OBJECTIVES: This review aimed: (1) to determine whether corticosteroid therapy  reduces the proportion of patients who die or have a poor outcome at one to six  months after the onset of SAH or PICH; (2) to determine whether corticosteroid  therapy reduces the frequency of delayed cerebral ischaemia (DCI) in patients  with SAH; (3) to determine the frequency of adverse effects of corticosteroid  therapy in patients with SAH or PICH within six months of the onset of the  event. SEARCH STRATEGY: We searched the Cochrane Stroke Group Trials Register (last  searched November 2003). In addition, we searched MEDLINE (1966 to March 2004)  and EMBASE (1980 to March 2004), and searched reference lists of relevant  studies identified. We also made an attempt to identify any relevant ongoing and  published or unpublished studies by contacting trialists and pharmaceutical  companies. SELECTION CRITERIA: We sought to identify all randomised or quasi-randomised  clinical trials of corticosteroid therapy, in patients with SAH or PICH, that  have a placebo or standard strategy arm as control. Patients of any age and  either gender with clinically (bed-side) diagnosed PICH and cerebrospinal fluid  documented SAH were included in the analysis. The data were analysed both  separately and combined for computed tomography (CT)/magnetic resonance imaging  (MRI)/autopsy/angiography verified patients. DATA COLLECTION AND ANALYSIS: Data extracted from eligible clinical trials  included: (1) death and poor outcome (death, severe disability, or vegetative  state) within the first one to six months of the event onset (primary outcomes);  (2) development of delayed cerebral ischaemia (as defined by the trialists) in  patients with SAH; and (3) adverse effects of the treatment during the scheduled  treatment or follow-up period (secondary outcomes). A pooled estimate of the  effect size was computed, and the test for heterogeneity between trial results  was carried out using The Cochrane Collaboration's Review Manager software,  RevMan 4.2. Intention-to-treat analysis was carried out whenever possible. MAIN RESULTS: Eight trials that fulfilled the eligibility criteria were  identified, with a total of 256 randomised patients in three SAH trials, and 206  patients in five PICH trials. The studies differed substantially with regard to  the study populations and drugs, and methodological quality. The number of  patients allocated to either hydrocortisone or fludrocortisone acetate treatment  in patients with SAH, or to dexamethasone treatment in patients with PICH, was  too small to make any definitive conclusions (confidence intervals were wide for  any of the outcome estimates). AUTHORS' CONCLUSIONS: Overall, there is no evidence of a beneficial or adverse  effect of corticosteroids in patients with either SAH or PICH. Confidence  intervals are wide and include clinically significant effects in both  directions."", ""BACKGROUND: Cerebral vasospasm and related delayed ischaemic deficits (DIDs)  occur in about 17% to 40% of patients with aneurysmal subarachnoid haemorrhage  (SAH) and lead to a poor outcome. Cholesterol-reducing agents might improve  unfavourable outcomes. OBJECTIVES: To assess the effects of cholesterol-reducing agents for improving  outcomes in patients with aneurysmal SAH. SEARCH METHODS: We searched the Cochrane Stroke Group Trials Register (May  2012), the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL) (The  Cochrane Library 2012, Issue 5), MEDLINE (1948 to May 2012) and EMBASE (1980 to  May 2012). We also searched three Chinese databases: SinoMed, CNKI and VIP (May  2012). In an effort to identify further published, ongoing and unpublished  trials we searched relevant clinical trials and research registers (May 2012),  contacted pharmaceutical companies and investigators known to be involved in  previous trials and screened the reference lists of all relevant articles  identified. SELECTION CRITERIA: We included randomised controlled trials (RCTs) that  compared cholesterol-reducing agents with control or placebo treatment in  participants with aneurysmal SAH. DATA COLLECTION AND ANALYSIS: Two review authors independently applied the  inclusion criteria, reviewed the relevant trials and extracted data. We did not  perform meta-analysis as we only included one RCT in the review. MAIN RESULTS: We included one study in which 39 patients received either  simvastatin (80 mg daily; n = 19) or placebo (n = 20) for 14 days. The incidence  of DIDs (secondary outcome) was 26% (5/19) in the simvastatin group versus 60%  (12/20) in the placebo group (risk ratio (RR) 0.44, 95% confidence interval (CI)  0.19 to 1.01, P = 0.05). This means that, in this study, simvastatin had no  effect on DIDs. Two patients in the simvastatin group and one patient in the  placebo group had elevated levels of aspartate transaminase or alanine  transaminase. One patient in the simvastatin group had a raised creatine  phosphokinase. There were no results from this trial for the primary outcome of  death or dependency at six months. AUTHORS' CONCLUSIONS: We cannot draw any conclusions about the effectiveness and  safety of lowering cholesterol in aneurysmal SAH because of insufficient  reliable evidence from only one small trial. More RCTs are needed."", 'INTRODUCTION: Cerebral vasospasm in aneurysmal subarachnoid hemorrhage (SAH) is  associated with poor outcome. The safety and feasibility of continuous high-dose  intravenous magnesium sulfate (MgSO4) for the prevention of cerebral vasospasm  and ischemic cerebral injury has not been well studied. METHODS: Patients presenting to our center within 72 hours of aneurysmalSAH  (confirmed by computed tomography [CT] scanning and cerebral angiography)  between June 2001 and October 2002 were enrolled in a prospective pilot study in  which they received MgSO4 as an adjunct to standard SAH management. Study  patients received an intravenous infusion of 12 g of MgSO4 in a 500-mL solution  of 0.9% NaCl administered at a rate of 4.06 mM (or 0.5 g) every hour over a  24-hour period for 10 days to achieve a target predetermined serum Mg range of  more than 1.5 to less than 4.0 mM/L. The effect of MgSO4 on clinical  examination, heart rate, and blood pressure was measured every 2 hours; serum  glucose and phenytoin levels were monitored daily. Outcome measures included  evidence of vasospasm on clinical examination, transcranial Doppler study  ((TCD); velocity >or=100 cm/s), or repeat cerebral angiogram obtained within 10  days of SAH; and Glasgow Outcome Scale (GOS) score assessment and CT scan  evidence of ischemic infarction at 30 days. RESULTS: Nineteen patients (mean age: 55 years; range: 39-84 years; 11 males, 8  females) were enrolled in the study. Presenting Hunt Hess grade was II or  higher; mean Fisher grade was 3. Vasospasm was observed in nine patients (by  clinical examination in two, TCD in five, and angiogram in nine). The mean serum  Mg level was 2.7 mM/L (standard deviation: +/- 0.37) and was maintained during  the infusion period. No clinical adverse effects, hemodynamic changes, or  fluctuations in serum glucose or phenytoin levels were observed. None of the  patients died; no CT evidence of ischemic infarction was present; and most had  good outcomes (GOS 5 in 10 patients; GOS 4 in 8 patients). CONCLUSION: Our study confirmed the safety and feasibility of a continuous  infusion of high-dose intravenous MgSO4 in patients with aneurysmal SAH.  Randomized controlled trials are required to confirm the promising results.', 'Tirilazad mesylate, a nonglucocorticoid 21-aminosteroid, has been shown in  experimental models to reduce vasospasm following subarachnoid hemorrhage (SAH)  and to reduce infarct size from focal cerebral ischemia. To test whether  treatment with tirilazad would reduce ischemic symptoms from vasospasm and  improve overall outcome in patients with ruptured aneurysms, a prospective  randomized, double-blind, vehicle-controlled trial was conducted at 41  neurosurgical centers in Europe, Australia, and New Zealand. One thousand  twenty-three patients were randomly assigned to receive 0.6, 2, or 6 mg/kg per  day of intravenously administered tirilazad or a placebo containing the citrate  vehicle. All patients were also treated with intravenously administered  nimodipine. Patients receiving 6 mg/kg per day of tirilazad had reduced  mortality (p = 0.01) and a greater frequency of good recovery on the Glasgow  Outcome Scale 3 months after SAH (p = 0.01) than similar patients treated with  vehicle. There was a reduction in symptomatic vasospasm in the group that  received 6 mg/kg per day tirilazad; however, the difference was not  statistically significant (p = 0.048). The benefits of treatment with tirilazad  were predominantly shown in men rather than in women. There were no material  differences between the outcomes in the groups treated with 0.6 and 2 mg/kg  tirilazad per day and the group treated with vehicle. Tirilazad was well  tolerated at all three dose levels. These observations suggest that tirilazad  mesylate, at a dosage of 6 mg/kg per day, is safe and improves overall outcome  in patients (especially in men) who have experienced an aneurysmal SAH.', 'To test the safety and efficacy of tirilazad mesylate, a nonglucocorticoid  21-aminosteroid, in improving the outcome of patients with aneurysmal  subarachnoid hemorrhage (SAH), 902 patients were enrolled in a prospective  randomized, double-blind, vehicle-controlled trial at 54 North American  neurosurgical centers. Five patients were excluded prior to receiving any study  drug. Of 897 patients who received at least one dose of study medication, 300  received a placebo containing a citrate vehicle, 298 received 2 mg/kg per day  tirilazad, and 299 received 6 mg/kg per day tirilazad, all administered  intravenously beginning within 48 hours of the SAH and continuing through 10  days posthemorrhage. All patients were also treated with orally administered  nimodipine. At 3 months post-SAH, there were no significant differences (p <  0.025) among the groups with regard to mortality rate, favorable outcome on the  Glasgow Outcome Scale, or employment status. During the first 14 days after the  SAH, there were no significant differences among the groups in the incidence or  severity of clinically symptomatic or angiographically identifiable cerebral  vasospasm. Mortality data stratified by gender and neurological grade on  admission (assessed according to a modified World Federation of Neurological  Surgeons scale) demonstrated that the men with Grades IV to V had a 33%  mortality rate in the vehicle group, 52% in the 2 mg/kg per day tirilazad group  (p = 0.29), and 5% in the 6 mg/kg per day tirilazad group (p = 0.03). Tirilazad  was well tolerated at both dose levels. Tirilazad mesylate at dosage levels of  up to 6 mg/kg per day for 8 to 10 days following SAH did not improve the overall  outcome in patients with aneurysmal SAH in this trial. The differences in the  efficacy of tirilazad in this trial and a previously reported trial in Europe,  Australia, and New Zealand, in which dosage levels of tirilazad of 6 mg/kg per  day reduced mortality rates and increased good recovery, may be a result of  differences in admission characteristics of the patients and/or differences in  management protocols, including the use of anticonvulsant medications.', 'Objective The present study was performed to explore the therapeutic potential  of simvastatin in subarachnoid hemorrhage (SAH) in the context of the  Simvastatin in Aneurysmal Subarachnoid Hemorrhage (STASH) trial. Methods  MEDLINE, EMBASE, and the Cochrane Library were searched for all randomized  controlled trials (RCTs) investigating the therapeutic effect of simvastatin on  aneurysmal SAH. We applied a random-effects model to calculate the data. Results  Five RCTs involving 951 patients met the eligibility criteria. We found no  statistically significant effects on vasospasm detected by transcranial cerebral  Doppler (relative risk [RR], 0.91; 95% confidence interval [CI], 0.55-1.49),  delayed cerebral ischemia (DCI) (RR, 0.85; 95% CI, 0.63-1.14), or all-cause  mortality (RR, 1.02; 95% CI, 0.67-1.54). Subgroup analysis showed that these  consolidated results were stable at different doses, different times to start of  treatment, and different courses of treatment in all included RCTs. Sensitivity  analysis showed that the STASH trial, which had a large population, did not  influence the consolidated results of all three outcomes. Conclusions  Simvastatin showed no benefits in decreasing the incidence of vasospasm, DCI, or  all-cause mortality after aneurysmal SAH. We conclude that patients with SAH  should not be treated routinely with simvastatin during the acute stage.', 'Tirilazad mesylate, a nonglucocorticoid 21-aminosteroid, has been used in two  randomized, double-blind, vehicle-controlled trials in Europe, Australia, New  Zealand, and in North America in patients with aneurysmal subarachnoid  hemorrhage. The first trial has been concluded, enrolled 1023 patients, and  demonstrated a dramatic reduction in mortality from 27% to 3% (p = 0.01) in  males receiving 6 mg/kg/day tirilazad for 10 days, when compared to  vehicle-treated patients. There was also a less incidence of symptomatic  vasospasm, and the frequency of hypertensive-hypervolemic-hemodilution therapy  was significantly reduced. The reduction in mortality rate was remarkable,  however the benefits of treatment with tirilazad were predominantly shown in men  rather than in women. This clinical trial suggest that tirilazad mesylate, at a  dosage of 6 mg/kg/day, improves overall outcome in aneurysmal subarachnoid  hemorrhage patients. Further data from the North America trial and the trial in  women receiving higher doses of tirilazad are still pending.', 'BACKGROUND: There has been longstanding controversy over the use of magnesium  sulfate infusion in the medical management of aneurysmal subarachnoid hemorrhage  (SAH). Several clinical trials evaluating the beneficial effects of magnesium on  cerebral vasospasm and their poor outcome have been published. However, results  from the majority of these studies have been inconclusive. This meta-analysis  was performed to evaluate the effectiveness of magnesium on patient outcomes  after aneurysmal SAH. MATERIALS AND METHODS: PubMed and the Cochrane library were searched for  controlled clinical trials assessing the efficacy of magnesium sulfate infusion  after aneurysmal SAH. Eight studies consisting of 936 patients were included. RESULTS: There was a decreased risk of poor outcome at 3-6 months after SAH in  magnesium treatment groups when compared to placebo [0.78 (95% CI 0.66-0.93)].  Poor outcome was defined as severe disability, persistent vegetative state, or  death, as measured by the Glasgow outcome scale (GOS), extended Glasgow outcome  scale (GOSE) or modified Rankin scale (mRS). The risk of mortality after SAH was  unaffected by magnesium treatment [RR 0.68 (95% CI 0.58-1.27)]. CONCLUSION: Magnesium sulfate infusion decreases risk of poor outcome after  aneurysmal SAH. Current studies in the literature do not suggest a role for  magnesium sulfate in mortality reduction after SAH.', 'OBJECT: Findings from previous multicenter clinical trials have suggested that  tirilazad mesylate, a synthetic nonhormonal 21-aminosteroid, might be effective  in preventing delayed cerebral ischemia following subarachnoid hemorrhage (SAH).  This beneficial effect, however, was greater in males than females, possibly  because of gender-related pharmacokinetic differences. The authors sought to  assess the effects of administering a larger dose of tirilazad in women with  SAH. METHODS: To test the efficacy of a higher tirilazad mesylate dose in female  patients, a prospective randomized, double-blind, vehicle-controlled trial was  conducted at 56 neurosurgical centers in Europe, Australia, New Zealand, and  South Africa. Eight hundred nineteen patients were randomly assigned to receive  either 15 mg/kg/day of tirilazad mesylate or a placebo containing the citrate  vehicle. The two groups were similar in prognostic factors for delayed cerebral  ischemia and overall outcome. High-dose tirilazad appeared to be well tolerated  because no differences in the incidence of untoward medical events were noted  between the two groups. Medical and surgical interventions were no different in  the two treatment groups except for hyperdynamic therapy (intentional  hypervolemia, induced hypertension, and/or hemodilution), which was more often  used in the placebo-treated group to counteract symptomatic vasospasm (24% of  patients given placebo compared with 18% of patients given tirilazad, p = 0.02).  Mortality rates and overall outcome, assessed using the Glasgow Outcome Scale at  3 months post-SAH, were not different between the two groups, despite a  significantly lower incidence of delayed cerebral ischemia in patients given  tirilazad. Post hoc subgroup analysis by neurological grade also did not reveal  significant differences in outcome, although a trend toward a lower mortality  rate favoring the study drug was present in patients with neurological Grade IV  and V at admission (32% compared with 37%). Symptomatic vasospasm occurred in  33.7% of the placebo-treated patients as opposed to 24.8% of the patients who  were given tirilazad (p = 0.005). The severity of symptomatic vasospasm was also  attenuated by administration of the study drug (severe symptomatic vasospasm was  reported in 11% of the placebo-treated patients compared with 6% of patients in  the tirilazad-treated group (p = 0.008). Clinical cerebral infarction from  vasospasm was also reduced from 13% in the vehicle-treated group to 8% in the  tirilazad-treated group (p < 0.04). CONCLUSIONS: The authors conclude that high-dose tirilazad mesylate is well  tolerated in women with aneurysmal SAH. Although a significant reduction in the  incidence of symptomatic vasospasm was observed in the treatment group, the  primary end point (mortality rate at 3 months post-SAH) was not affected by the  study drug. The use of other potentially effective rescue therapies (that is,  hypervolemia, hemodilution, and induced hypertension) to counteract vasospasm  may have been responsible for these contrasting observations between the two  groups.', ""The 21-aminosteroid lipid-peroxidation inhibitor, tirilazad mesylate (U-74006F),  recently was shown in a large multinational Phase III clinical trial to decrease  mortality and improve neurological recovery in patients 3 months after onset of  aneurysmal subarachnoid hemorrhage (SAH). A major tirilazad metabolite in  animals and man, U-89678 is formed when the 4-5 double bond in the A-ring is  reduced and has been postulated to contribute significantly to tirilazad's  neuroprotective effects. In the first experiment of the present study, the  authors compared the effects of tirilazad and U-89678 on acute blood-brain  barrier (BBB) damage in rats subjected to SAH via injection of 300 microliters  of autologous nonheparinized blood under the dura of the left cortex. The rats  were treated by intravenous administration of either 0.3 or 1.0 mg/kg of  tirilazad or U-89678 10 minutes before and 2 hours after SAH, and BBB damage was  quantified according to the extravasation of the protein-bound Evans' blue dye  into the injured cortex 3 hours post-SAH. The results revealed that 0.3 and 1.0  mg/kg tirilazad significantly reduced SAH-induced BBB damage 35.2% (p < 0.05)  and 60.6% (p < 0.0001), respectively, in comparison to treatment with vehicle.  The 0.3- and 1.0-mg/kg doses of U-89678 also decreased injury by 39.1% (p <  0.05) and 21.3% (not significant), respectively. In the second experiment, the  investigators assessed the relative abilities of tirilazad and U-89678 to  protect cultured neurons from iron-induced lipid peroxidative injury. Fetal  mouse spinal cord cells were pretreated with 3, 10, or 30 microM tirilazad or  U-89678 for 1 hour and then exposed to 200 microM ferrous ammonium sulfate (FAS)  for 40 minutes. Cell viability was measured in terms of the uptake of  [3H]alpha-(methyl)-aminoisobutyric acid 45 minutes after the FAS treatment. Both  compounds enhanced neuronal survival in a concentration-dependent fashion.  Although the two were equally efficacious, U-89678 was slightly more potent than  its parent. On the basis of these findings, the authors conclude that the  tirilazad metabolite, U-89678, possesses vaso- and neuroprotective properties  that are essentially equivalent to the parent 21-aminosteroid. Hence, U-89678  probably contributes to the protective effects of tirilazad in SAH and other  insults to the central nervous system.""]]]","Based on the information provided, tirilazad mesylate appears to have some effectiveness in reducing mortality and improving neurological recovery in patients with aneurysmal subarachnoid hemorrhage (SAH) 3 months after the onset. Specifically:

1. It demonstrated a significant reduction in mortality rate (from 27% to 3%) in male patients receiving 6 mg/kg/day tirilazad for 10 days compared to those receiving a placebo.

2. It showed a lower incidence of symptomatic vasospasm.

3. It was generally well-tolerated.

However, it did not show a significant impact on all-cause mortality or the incidence of delayed cerebral ischemia (DCI). The benefits were predominantly observed in men rather than women.

In summary, while tirilazad can be considered effective in reducing mortality, its impact on DCI and overall mortality remains inconclusive. Its use should be carefully considered based on these findings.","[{'Exact': array([12.12070423,  5.53572616,  3.910069  , 25.09503579,  9.90920389,

Which animal bite can cause Capnocytophaga canimorsus infection?,"[[['Capnocytophaga canimorsus is a gram-negative rod that can be transmitted  primarily by dog bites. This life-threatening organism commonly causes sepsis in  patients with splenectomy or alcoholism. A 53-year-old rheumatoid arthritis male  treated with methotrexate (MTX) for 5 years was admitted for a 4-day history of  fever and dyspnea. He had been bitten on a finger by the family dog 4\xa0days  before onset. Laboratory tests revealed pancytopenia, acute renal failure, and  evidence of disseminated intravascular coagulation, and he subsequently  developed acute respiratory distress syndrome. Furthermore, blood cultures grew  gram-negative bacilli and despite intensive treatment, he died 5\xa0days after  admission. Later, C. canimorsus was identified from his culture samples using a  species-specific polymerase chain reaction. C. canimorsus infections should be  considered in the differential diagnosis of sepsis for immunocompromised hosts  following animal bites.', 'Capnocytophaga canimorsus is a gram-negative, capnophilic rod constituting  normal bacterial flora of the oral cavity of dogs and cats. It is also  considered to be an etiological factor of infections in human that may lead to  multiple complications, i.a. sepsis, endocarditis and meningitis. C. canimorsus  poses a serious threat, especially to patients with asplenia, cirrhosis or  alcohol abuse. In most cases, infection occurs after a dog bite. Isolation and  identification of the bacteria from the biological material is difficult and  often delayed because of slow growth of the bacteria on microbiological media.  Gold standard for bacteriological identification of C. canimorsus is polymerase  chain reaction method. Amoxicillin with clavulanic acid is considered the drug  of choice used in prophylaxis of C. canimorsus infections. Based on the data  available from the literature, the authors present the epidemiology, risk  factors, clinical picture, diagnostic methods and treatment of the C. canimorsus  infection.', 'Capnocytophaga species are gram-negative bacilli that inhabit mammalian oral  surfaces and can cause opportunistic infection, especially in asplenic patients.  The species Capnocytophaga canimorsus is particularly associated with dog bites  and is known to cause endocarditis, meningitis, and sepsis in the general  population. In pregnant patients, infections tied to Capnocytophaga species from  human flora have been associated with preterm labor, chorioamnionitis, and  neonatal septicemia. There is little known about the effects of  zoonotically-acquired Capnocytophaga infection in pregnant patients. In this  case report, we present a patient with Capnocytophaga bacteremia acquired after  a dog bite associated with profound thrombocytopenia and preterm labor. Dog  bites are common in the United States, and we present basic recommendations for  management of dog bites in pregnant patients in order to avoid morbidity  associated with delay in time to antibiotic treatment of infection as described  in this case.', 'BACKGROUND: Capnocytophaga canimorsus is a commensal bacterium found in the  saliva of dogs and cats. Clinically significant infections in humans after a  bite are often associated with the presence of immune deficiency. Early  recognition and appropriate treatment are crucial for patient survival. In  addition, patients with immune deficiency are susceptible to serious  life-threatening nosocomial infections, which may also influence the prognosis  of patients with Capnocytophaga canimorsus infection. CASE PRESENTATION: A 62-year-old Caucasian female was admitted with septic  shock, acute respiratory distress syndrome, acute renal failure, metabolic  acidosis and disseminated intravascular coagulation after suffering two small  bites from her dog. She had received a splenectomy during childhood. The patient  survived after early empiric treatment with antibiotics and intensive supportive  care, including ventilation support, a high dose of noradrenalin, and continuous  venovenous hemodialysis applied prior to the definitive diagnosis of  Capnocytophaga canimorsus sepsis. She improved within 2 weeks but, despite all  efforts to prevent nosocomial infection, her hospital course was complicated by  Enterococcus species and Candida albicans pleuropneumonia that prolonged her  stay in the intensive care unit, and necessitated ventilation support for 2  months. CONCLUSION: Severe Capnocytophaga canimorsus sepsis may be complicated by  life-threatening nosocomial infection in immunocompromized patients. The  prophylactic application of antibiotics after a dog bite should be considered in  high-risk individuals with immune deficiency in order to prevent both  Capnocytophyga canimorsus sepsis and serious nosocomial complications.', 'INTRODUCTION: Capnocytophaga canimorsus infections are associated with dog  bites, especially in asplenic or immunocompromised patients, and typically  manifest as sepsis and/or bacteremia. Meningitis has been rarely described, and  its diagnosis may be delayed due to poor or slow growth using traditional  culture techniques. We provide our experience using polymerase chain reaction  (PCR) to establish the diagnosis and perform a comprehensive review of C.  canimorsus meningitis cases to provide summary data on the clinical  manifestations, diagnosis, and outcomes of this unusual infection. METHODS: A systematic review of the peer-reviewed English literature (PubMed,  Embase, Ovid Medline) from January 1966 to March 2018 was conducted to identify  cases of C. canimorsus meningitis. Data collected included demographics, risk  factors, cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) findings, PCR results, treatments, and  outcomes. Descriptive statistics are presented as numbers (percentages) and  medians (ranges). RESULTS: A total of 37 patients were reviewed with a median age of 63\xa0years  (12\xa0days to 83\xa0years) with a male predominance (76%). A relatively low  proportion had an immunocompromised state (16% splenectomy and 5% steroid use);  the most common risk factor was alcoholism (19%). Fifty-nine percent reported a  dog bite (all within\u2009≤\u200914\xa0days prior to presentation), while 22%\xa0reported a  non-bite dog exposure, 3% reported cat bite, and 3% reported both dog and cat  exposures; 11% reported no animal contact. CSF parameters included a median  white count of 1024 cells/mm3, 81% had neutrophilic predominance, median protein  of 190\xa0mg/dl, and median glucose CSF/serum ratio 0.23. In 54% of cases, blood  cultures were positive for C. canimorsus (median, 4\xa0days) and 70% had positive  CSF cultures (median, 5\xa0days). PCR established the diagnosis in eight (22%)  cases. Antibiotic therapy was given for a median of 15\xa0days (range, 7 to  42\xa0days). Prognosis was overall favorable with only one (3%) death reported and  adverse neurologic and/or physical sequelae in 19% of the survivors. CONCLUSION: C. canimorsus meningitis is a rare but increasingly important  clinical entity occurring in patients of all ages, typically after dog exposure.  While classically considered an infection among immunocompromised patients, most  cases have occurred in previously healthy, immunocompetent persons. Diagnosis  may be rapidly established by PCR, and this test should be considered in  culture-negative cases with associated exposures. Outcome was generally  favorable after a median antibiotic duration of 15\xa0days.', 'Capnocytophaga canimorsus is part of normal gingival flora of dogs and cats. The  organism can cause septicemia, meningitis, and endocarditis in humans after  contact with dogs or cats. In spite of the frequency of gastrointestinal  symptoms in C. canimorsus infection patients, specific gastrointestinal disease  or clinical images have not been reported. We report a case of C. canimorsus  bacteremia presenting with acute cholecystitis in elderly woman. She suffered  from general fatigue and right upper abdominal pain. She had leukocytosis and  abnormal liver function tests. She showed abnormal findings of the gallbladder  by abdominal computed tomography and ultrasonography. She was diagnosed with  acute cholecystitis without gallstones and was administered with antibiotics.  C.\xa0canimorsus was isolated from blood cultures. A history of an insignificant  wound secondary to a dog bite was elicited. She recovered completely with  antibiotic treatment. This case revealed that C.\xa0canimorsus bacteremia can be  presented with acute cholecystitis, suggesting that C.\xa0canimorsus could cause  cholecystitis. And this cholecystitis can be treated with antibiotics without  operation. Physicians seeing patients with acute cholecysitis should ask  questions regarding animal contact.', ""INTRODUCTION: The gram-negative bacteria known as Capnocytophaga canimorsus (C.  canimorsus) is found in dog saliva and rarely can cause severe infection in  humans following a bite or scratch. There has previously been just a single case  described in the literature of Acute Acalculous Cholecystitis (AAC) secondary to  C. canimorsus. PRESENTATION OF CASE: Here we describe the second ever published case of C.  canimorsus bacteremia presenting with acute cholecystitis. The patient presented  with epigastric pain and sepsis three weeks post domestic dog bite. On further  examination, he was Murphy's sign positive. Investigations included blood  cultures, Ultrasound Scan and Computed Tomography of the Abdomen. He was treated  with intravenous fluid resuscitation, and intravenous ceftriaxone and  metronidazole. He required an extended course of antibiotics for complete  symptom resolution. His blood cultures were positive for C. Canimorsus. DISCUSSION: This case highlights the ever-present need for thorough history and  examination, and consideration of prolonged antibiotics for cases of  cholecystitis that could be secondary to C. canimorsus bacteremia. CONCLUSION: We strongly advocate blood cultures in patients who present with  abdominal pain and sepsis, particularly when they have a recent history of  animal bite. In cases of cholecystitis secondary to C. canimorsus it may be  necessary to monitor the patient's progress more closely and treat with  prolonged targeted antibiotic therapy."", 'A diagnosis of myocardial infarction is made using a combination of clinical  presentation, electrocardiogram and cardiac biomarkers. However, myocardial  infarction can be caused by factors other than coronary artery plaque rupture  and thrombosis. We describe an interesting case presenting with hypertensive  emergency and type 2 myocardial infarction resulting from Pheochromocytoma  associated with Capnocytophaga canimorsus infection from a dog bite. We also  review current literature on the management of hypertensive emergency and  Pheochromocytoma.', ""BACKGROUND: Animal bites are typically harmless, but in rare cases infections  introduced by such bites can be fatal. Capnocytophaga canimorsus, found in the  normal oral flora of dogs, has the potential to cause conditions ranging from  minor cellulitis to fatal sepsis. The tendency of C. canimorsus infections to  present with varied symptoms, the organism's fastidious nature, and difficulty  of culturing make this a challenging diagnosis. Rarely, bacterial cytotoxins  such as those produced by C. canimorsus may act as causative agents of TTP,  further complicating the diagnosis. Early recognition is crucial for survival,  and the variability of presentation must be appreciated. We present the first  known case of C. canimorsus infection resulting in TTP that initially presented  as splenic infarction. CASE PRESENTATION: 72-year-old Caucasian male presented with a four-day history  of abdominal pain, nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, and intermittent confusion. On  presentation, vital signs were stable and the patient was afebrile. Physical  examination was unremarkable apart from petechiae on the inner left thigh, and  extreme diffuse abdominal pain to palpation and percussion along with positive  rebound tenderness. Initial investigations revealed leukocytosis with left shift  and thrombocytopenia, but normal liver enzymes, cardiac enzymes, lipase, INR and  PTT. Abdominal CT demonstrated a non-enhancing spleen and hemoperitoneum,  suggesting complete splenic infarction. Although the patient remained afebrile,  he continued deteriorating over the next two days with worsening  thrombocytopenia. After becoming febrile, he developed microangiopathic  hemolytic anemia and hemodynamic instability, and soon after was intubated due  to hypoxic respiratory failure and decreased consciousness. Plasma exchange was  initiated but subsequently stopped when positive blood cultures grew a  gram-negative organism. The patient progressively improved following therapy  with piperacillin-tazobactam, which was switched to imipenem, then meropenem  when Capnocytophaga was identified. CONCLUSIONS: There is a common misconception amongst practitioners that the  presence of systemic infection excludes the possibility of TTP and vice versa.  This case emphasizes that TTP may occur secondary to a systemic infection,  thereby allowing the two processes to coexist. It is important to maintain a  wide differential when considering the diagnosis of either TTP or C. canimorsus  infection since delays in treatment may have fatal consequences."", 'Capnocytophaga canimorsus is a fastidious, slow-growing, gram-negative,  rod-shaped bacterium that belongs to the normal oral flora of dogs and cats.  Human septicemic infections are associated with a high mortality; most cases  occur in immunocompromised patients with a history of dog bite. The fifth case  of cat-associated septicemia caused by Capnocytophaga canimorsus is described.  The six case reports presented here point out the characteristics reported  previously: (a) cats are a source of human infection; (b) alcohol abuse is an  important risk factor for the development of septicemic Capnocytophaga  canimorsus infection; (c) septicemic infection often manifests with disseminated  intravascular consumption coagulopathy or purpura; and (d) some cases of  septicemia in humans result from pets that lick skin ulcers.']]]",Dog bite can cause Capnocytophaga canimorsus infection.,"[{'Exact': array([1.39149011, 0.92964426, 1.75859985, 1.02102704, 1.69900709,

Does RNA polymerase II have RNA cleavage activity?,"[[['RNA chain elongation by RNA polymerase is a dynamic process. Techniques that  allow the isolation of active elongation complexes have enabled investigators to  describe individual steps in the polymerization of RNA chains. This article will  describe recent studies of elongation by RNA polymerase II (pol II). At least  four types of blockage to chain elongation can be overcome by elongation factor  SII: (a) naturally occurring ""arrest"" sequences, (b) DNA-bound protein, (c)  drugs bound in the DNA minor groove, and (d) chain-terminating substrates  incorporated into the RNA chain. SII binds to RNA polymerase II and stimulates a  ribonuclease activity that shortens nascent transcripts from their 3\' ends. This  RNA cleavage is required for chain elongation from some template positions. As a  result, the pol II elongation complex can repeatedly shorten and reextend the  nascent RNA chain in a process we refer to as cleavage-resynthesis. Hence,  assembly of large RNAs does not necessarily proceed in a direct manner. The  ability to shorten and reextend nascent RNAs means that a transcription  impediment through which only half the enzyme molecules can proceed per  encounter, can be overcome by 99% of the molecules after six iterations of  cleavage-resynthesis. Surprisingly, the boundaries of the elongation complex do  not move upstream after RNA cleavage. The physico-chemical alterations in the  elongation complex that accompany RNA cleavage and permit renewed chain  elongation are not yet understood.', 'Regulation of transcription elongation is an important mechanism in controlling  eukaryotic gene expression. SII is an RNA polymerase II-binding protein that  stimulates transcription elongation and also activates nascent transcript  cleavage by RNA polymerase II in elongation complexes in vitro (Reines, D.  (1992) J. Biol. Chem. 267, 3795-3800). Here we show that SII-dependent in vitro  transcription through an arrest site in a human gene is preceded by nascent  transcript cleavage. RNA cleavage appeared to be an obligatory step in the SII  activation process. Recombinant SII activated cleavage while a truncated  derivative lacking polymerase binding activity did not. Cleavage was not  restricted to an elongation complex arrested at this particular site, showing  that nascent RNA hydrolysis is a general property of RNA polymerase II  elongation complexes. These data support a model whereby SII stimulates  elongation via a ribonuclease activity of the elongation complex.', ""Eukaryotic RNA polymerase II transcribes precursors of mRNAs and of  non-protein-coding RNAs such as snRNAs and snoRNAs. These RNAs have to be  processed at their 3' ends to be functional. mRNAs are matured by cleavage and  polyadenylation that require a well-characterized protein complex. Small RNAs  are also subject to 3' end cleavage but are not polyadenylated. Here we show  that two newly identified proteins, Pti1p and Ref2p, although they were found  associated with the pre-mRNA 3' end processing complex, are essential for yeast  snoRNA 3' end maturation. We also provide evidence that Pti1p probably acts by  uncoupling cleavage and polyadenylation, and functions in coordination with the  Nrd1p-dependent pathway for 3' end formation of non-polyadenylated transcripts."", 'We have reported previously the isolation and genetic characterization of  mutations in the gene encoding the largest subunit of yeast RNA polymerase II  (RNAPII), which lead to 6-azauracil (6AU)-sensitive growth. It was suggested  that these mutations affect the functional interaction between RNAPII and  transcription-elongation factor TFIIS because the 6AU-sensitive phenotype of the  mutant strains was similar to that of a strain defective in the production of  TFIIS and can be suppressed by increasing the dosage of the yeast TFIIS-encoding  gene, PPR2, RNAPIIs were purified and characterized from two independent  6AU-sensitive yeast mutants and from wild-type (wt) cells. In vitro, in the  absence of TFIIS, the purified wt polymerase and the two mutant polymerases  showed similar specific activity in polymerization, readthrough at intrinsic  transcriptional arrest sites and nascent RNA cleavage. In contrast to the wt  polymerase, both mutant polymerases were not stimulated by the addition of a  3-fold molar excess of TFIIS in assays of promoter-independent transcription,  readthrough or cleavage. However, stimulation of the ability of the mutant  RNAPIIs to cleave nascent RNA and to read through intrinsic arrest sites was  observed at TFIIS:RNAPII molar ratios greater than 600:1. Consistent with these  findings, the binding affinity of the mutant polymerases for TFIIS was found to  be reduced by more than 50-fold compared with that of the wt enzyme. These  studies demonstrate that TFIIS has an important role in the regulation of  transcription by yeast RNAPII and identify a possible binding site for TFIIS on  RNAPII.', ""RNA polymerase II is implicated in the RNA-templated RNA synthesis during  replication of viroids and Hepatitis Delta Virus (HDV); however, neither the RNA  template nor protein factor requirements for this process are well defined. We  have developed an in vitro transcription system based on HeLa cell nuclear  extract (NE), in which a segment of antigenomic RNA corresponding to the  left-hand tip region of the HDV rod-like structure serves as a template for  efficient and highly specific RNA synthesis. Accumulation of the unique RNA  product is highly sensitive to alpha-amanitin in HeLa NE and only partially  sensitive to this drug in NE from PMG cells that contain an allele of the  alpha-amanitin-resistant subunit of pol II, strongly suggesting pol II  involvement in this reaction. Detailed analysis of the RNA product revealed that  it represents a chimeric molecule composed of a newly synthesized transcript  covalently attached to the 5' half of the RNA template. Selection of the start  site for transcription is remarkably specific and depends on the secondary  structure of the RNA template, rather than on its primary sequence. Some  features of this reaction resemble the RNA cleavage-extension process observed  for pol II-arrested complexes in vitro. A possible involvement of the described  reaction in HDV replication is discussed."", ""In the absence of DNA, purified yeast RNA polymerase II can bind RNA to form a  binary complex. RNA in such RNA-RNA polymerase complexes undergoes reactions  previously thought to be unique to nascent RNA in ternary complexes with DNA,  including TFIIS-dependent cleavage and elongation by 3'-terminal addition of NMP  from NTP. Both of these reactions are inhibited by alpha-amanitin. Hence, by  several criteria the RNA in binary complexes is bound to the polymerase in a  manner quite similar to that in ternary complexes in which the catalytic site  for nucleotide addition is positioned at or near the 3'-OH terminus of the RNA.  These findings are consistent with a model for the RNA polymerase ternary  complex in which the RNA is bound at the 3' terminus through two protein-binding  sites located up to 10 nt apart."", 'TFIIS is a transcription elongation factor that stimulates transcript cleavage  activity of arrested RNA polymerase II (Pol II). Recent studies revealed that  TFIIS has also a role in Pol II transcription initiation. To improve our  understanding of TFIIS function in vivo, we performed genome-wide location  analysis of this factor. Under normal growth conditions, TFIIS was detected on  Pol II-transcribed genes, and TFIIS occupancy was well correlated with that of  Pol II, indicating that TFIIS recruitment is not restricted to NTP-depleted  cells. Unexpectedly, TFIIS was also detected on almost all Pol III-transcribed  genes. TFIIS and Pol III occupancies correlated well genome-wide on this novel  class of targets. In vivo, some dst1 mutants were partly defective in tRNA  synthesis and showed a reduced Pol III occupancy at the restrictive temperature.  In vitro transcription assays suggested that TFIIS may affect Pol III start site  selection. These data provide strong in vivo and in vitro evidence in favor of a  role of TFIIS as a general Pol III transcription factor.', 'Influenza virus intimately associates with host RNA polymerase II (Pol II) and  mRNA processing machinery. Here, we use mammalian native elongating transcript  sequencing (mNET-seq) to examine Pol II behavior during viral infection. We show  that influenza virus executes a two-pronged attack on host transcription. First,  viral infection causes decreased Pol II gene occupancy downstream of  transcription start sites. Second, virus-induced cellular stress leads to a  catastrophic failure of Pol II termination at poly(A) sites, with transcription  often continuing for tens of kilobases. Defective Pol II termination occurs  independently of the ability of the viral NS1 protein to interfere with host  mRNA processing. Instead, this termination defect is a common effect of diverse  cellular stresses and underlies the production of previously reported  downstream-of-gene transcripts (DoGs). Our work has implications for  understanding not only host-virus interactions but also fundamental aspects of  mammalian transcription.', 'Budding yeast RNA polymerase III (Pol III) contains a small, essential subunit,  named C11, that is conserved in humans and shows a strong homology to TFIIS. A  mutant Pol III, heterocomplemented with Schizosaccharomyces pombe C11, was  affected in transcription termination in vivo. A purified form of the enzyme  (Pol III Delta), deprived of C11 subunit, initiated properly but ignored pause  sites and was defective in termination. Remarkably, Pol III Delta lacked the  intrinsic RNA cleavage activity of complete Pol III. In vitro reconstitution  experiments demonstrated that Pol III RNA cleavage activity is mediated by C11.  Mutagenesis in C11 of two conserved residues, which are critical for the  TFIIS-dependent cleavage activity of Pol II, is lethal. Immunoelectron  microscopy data suggested that C11 is localized on the mobile thumb-like stalk  of the polymerase. We propose that C11 allows the enzyme to switch between an  RNA elongation and RNA cleavage mode and that the essential role of the Pol III  RNA cleavage activity is to remove the kinetic barriers to the termination  process. The integration of TFIIS function into a specific Pol III subunit may  stem from the opposite requirements of Pol III and Pol II in terms of transcript  length and termination efficiency.', ""During gene transcription, the RNA polymerase (Pol) active center can catalyze  RNA cleavage. This intrinsic cleavage activity is strong for Pol I and Pol III  but very weak for Pol II. The reason for this difference is unclear because the  active centers of the polymerases are virtually identical. Here we show that Pol  II gains strong cleavage activity when the C-terminal zinc ribbon domain  (C-ribbon) of subunit Rpb9 is replaced by its counterpart from the Pol III  subunit C11. X-ray analysis shows that the C-ribbon has detached from its site  on the Pol II surface and is mobile. Mutagenesis indicates that the C-ribbon  transiently inserts into the Pol II pore to complement the active center. This  mechanism is also used by transcription factor IIS, a factor that can bind Pol  II and induce strong RNA cleavage. Together with published data, our results  indicate that Pol I and Pol III contain catalytic C-ribbons that complement the  active center, whereas Pol II contains a non-catalytic C-ribbon that is  immobilized on the enzyme surface. Evolution of the Pol II system may have  rendered mRNA transcript cleavage controllable by the dissociable factor  transcription factor IIS to enable promoter-proximal gene regulation and  elaborate 3'-processing and transcription termination.""]]]","Yes, RNA polymerase II has RNA cleavage activity. This activity can be stimulated by elongation factor SII, allowing the elongation complex to repeatedly shorten and reextend the nascent RNA chain. However, the intrinsic cleavage activity of Pol II is very weak compared to Pol I and Pol III.","[{'Exact': array([70.98714553,  8.38097523, -2.60290194, -0.21916597,  0.7401461 ,

The growth and multiplication of human hepatoma  cell lines (HepG2) under the effect of different concentrations of C-PC (0.8,  1.75, 3.5 and 7.0 microg/ml) against untreated cells as control for 24h were  investigated. The results showed that the proliferating cells in presence of  C-PC reached 70, 51, 44, and 39%, respectively. The results revealed that the  greatest reduction in proliferation of cells was recorded at 7.0 microg/ml and  LC50 at 1.75 microg/ml of C-PC. In parallel, to the previous results  HCl-denatured MG-P revealed that in mass of cells there is a pattern of  apoptosis because the expanded cytoplasmic area (bluish-green) reduced and  appeared faintly red as C-PC concentration increased. Moreover, the cells lost  all the nuclear entities then, become fragmented and having no nuclear remnants.  The C-PC may be a new potential anti-cancer drug for therapy of human hepatoma  cells.', 'BACKGROUND: In this study, responses to fatty acid treatments in commonly used  prostate cancer cell culture models and variability of gene expression between  them were determined. MATERIALS AND METHODS: PC3, DU145, LNCaP, VCaP and PNT2 cells were treated with  100 μM of either oleate, stearate or conjugated linoleate. Cell proliferation  and viability were assessed using trypan blue and 3-(4,  5-dimethylthiazol-2-yl)-2, 5-diphenyltetrazolium bromide (MTT) assay  respectively. Gene expression was measured using real-time polymerase chain  reaction (PCR). RESULTS: Conjugated linoleic acid reduced cell proliferation and viability in  all prostate cancer cell lines, whilst the effects of oleic and stearic acid on  proliferation were found to be cell line-dependent. A reduction in gene  expression of fatty acid desaturases was observed in prostate cancer cell lines  compared to normal prostate cells. CONCLUSION: Differential responses of the cell lines investigated here to fatty  acid treatment suggest that multiple prostate cancer cell line models should be  used when designing experiments aimed at examining lipid metabolism in prostate  cancer.', ""INTRODUCTION: Māori experience a disproportionate amount of smoking-related harm  (46% of adult Māori smoke). Effective cessation treatments that are both  accessible and attractive to Māori are urgently needed. Cytisine (a plant  extract found in Golden Rain [Cytisus laburnum L.] and the New Zealand Kowhai  [Sophora tetraptera L.] has a similar molecular makeup to nicotine, has been  used successfully as a cessation product in central and eastern Europe and  central Asia for many years, and is low priced. Recent reviews have found that  cytisine is twice as effective as a placebo for smoking cessation. This study  aimed to explore cytisine's potential as a 'rongoā Māori' (traditional Māori  remedy) and its attractiveness to Māori smokers compared with other cessation  products. METHODS: Māori that smoked were interviewed in two focus groups and eight  individual semi-structured interviews. Two key informants were interviewed also. RESULTS: Barriers to using cessation products were financial and effort cost,  pervasive smoking among family and peers, environments permissive of smoking,  and perceived cultural inappropriateness of treatments. Participants were very  interested in cytisine, supported the idea that it would be acceptable to  package it as a rongoā Māori, and all wanted to use it. Named appropriately,  packaged and promoted as a Māori cessation product, participants thought  cytisine would contribute to the restoration of Māori identity and traditional  beliefs and practices in addition to reducing smoking. CONCLUSIONS: Presented as a rongoā Māori, cytisine would likely be more  attractive to Māori than currently available cessation products. Confirmation of  efficacy and safety will be needed before promotion of the product could occur."", 'AIM: To immobilize dental pulp stem cells (DPSC) in alginate microspheres and to  determine cell viability, proliferation, stem cell characteristics and  osteogenic potential of the immobilized DPSCs. METHODOLOGY: Human DPSCs isolated from the dental pulp were immobilized in 1%  w/v alginate microspheres. Viability and proliferation of immobilized DPSCs were  determined by trypan blue and MTT assay, respectively. Stem cell characteristics  of DPSCs post immobilization were verified by labelling the cells with CD73 and  CD90. Osteogenic potential of immobilized DPSCs was assessed by the presence of  osteocalcin. Alizarin red staining and O-cresolphthalein complexone method  confirmed and quantified calcium deposition. A final reverse transcriptase PCR  evaluated the expression of osteogenic markers - ALP, Runx-2 and OCN. RESULTS: More than 80% of immobilized DPSCs were viable throughout the 3-week  study. Proliferation appeared controlled and consistent unlike DPSCs in the  control group. Presence of CD73 and CD90 markers confirmed the stem cell nature  of immobilized DPSCs. The presence of osteocalcin, an osteoblastic marker, was  confirmed in the microspheres on day 21. Mineralization assays showed high  calcium deposition indicating elevated osteogenic potential of immobilized  DPSCs. Osteogenic genes- ALP, Runx-2 and OCN were also upregulated in  immobilized DPSCs. Surprisingly, immobilized DPSCs in the control group cultured  in conventional stem cell media showed upregulation of osteogenic genes and  expressed osteocalcin. CONCLUSION: Dental pulp stem cells immobilized in alginate hydrogels exhibit  enhanced osteogenic potential while maintaining high cell viability both of  which are fundamental for bone tissue regeneration.', ""Ex vivo skin preservation is important for skin banks, burn centers, and in  research; however, the optimal preservation solution is not known. Human  amniotic fluid (HAF), in addition to its role in fetal wound healing, has  promise as an effective and readily available preservation solution. The purpose  of this study was to compare the efficacy of several solutions, including HAF,  in full-thickness skin preservation. Human amniotic fluid was obtained from  patients undergoing amniocentesis. Full-thickness skin obtained during  abdominoplasty was divided into 1-cm(2) samples. These specimens were preserved  in either saline, HAF from a single patient, pooled HAF, University of Wisconsin  solution, or custodial histidine-tryptophan-ketoglutarate solution at 4°C. There  were 5 samples in each group. Specimens were examined for keratinocyte survival  at 7, 14, 21, 28, and 35 days using the trypan blue assay. The first 200 cells  identified were counted to calculate the degree of cell death. Comparisons were  made between the groups, and a multivariable repeated-measures analysis was  performed to determine statistical significance, which was defined as P < 0.05.  The individual and pooled HAF showed greater keratinocyte survival than the  other solutions, at each time point. The difference was statistically  significant (P < 0.05) when compared to saline and custodial solution but not  statistically significant when compared to University of Wisconsin solution.  When used as a tissue preservation solution, HAF produces superior keratinocyte  survival than several commercially available solutions. Amniotic fluid, nature's  tissue preservation solution, may be an inexpensive, readily available  alternative for use in skin banks, burn centers, and research."", ""Hemoglobin is one of the most important molecules of the human body.

METHODS: We used MTT assays and trypan blue staining to test the viability of  cancer cell lines. Hoechst 33258 and DAPI staining were used to observe cell  apoptosis. Cell-cycle percentages were analyzed by flow cytometry. Apoptosis was  assayed using caspase-3 and poly (ADP-ribose) polymerase (PARP) combined with  Western blotting. Student's t-test was used for statistical analysis. RESULTS: PTS2 inhibited proliferation in four cancer cell lines in a  dose-dependent manner. Treated cells showed shrinkage, irregular fragments,  condensed and dispersed blue fluorescent particles compared with control cells.  PTS2 induced cycle-arrest and death. Cleavage of caspase-9, caspase-3, and PARP  were detected in PTS2-treated cells. Antitumor activity of PTS2 was more  effective against widely used cancer drugs and its precursor.

METHODS: In this randomized, placebo-controlled, multinational clinical trial,  we assigned 481 patients (nearly all of whom were negative for the human  immunodeficiency virus) with pulmonary multidrug-resistant tuberculosis to  receive delamanid, at a dose of 100 mg twice daily (161 patients) or 200 mg  twice daily (160 patients), or placebo (160 patients) for 2 months in  combination with a background drug regimen developed according to World Health  Organization guidelines. Sputum cultures were assessed weekly with the use of  both liquid broth and solid medium; sputum-culture conversion was defined as a  series of five or more consecutive cultures that were negative for growth of M.  tuberculosis. The primary efficacy end point was the proportion of patients with  sputum-culture conversion in liquid broth medium at 2 months. RESULTS: Among patients who received a background drug regimen plus 100 mg of  delamanid twice daily, 45.4% had sputum-culture conversion in liquid broth at 2  months, as compared with 29.6% of patients who received a background drug  regimen plus placebo (P=0.008). Likewise, as compared with the placebo group,  the group that received the background drug regimen plus 200 mg of delamanid  twice daily had a higher proportion of patients with sputum-culture conversion  (41.9%, P=0.04). The findings were similar with assessment of sputum-culture  conversion in solid medium. Most adverse events were mild to moderate in  severity and were evenly distributed across groups. Although no clinical events  due to QT prolongation on electrocardiography were observed, QT prolongation was  reported significantly more frequently in the groups that received delamanid. CONCLUSIONS: Delamanid was associated with an increase in sputum-culture  conversion at 2 months among patients with multidrug-resistant tuberculosis.  This finding suggests that delamanid could enhance treatment options for  multidrug-resistant tuberculosis.

Iron oxide (Fe3O4) NPs are  applied for both medical diagnostics and targeted drug delivery. We investigated  the potential cytotoxicity and genotoxicity of uncoated iron oxide (U-Fe3O4) NPs  in comparison with oleate-coated iron oxide (OC-Fe3O4) NPs. Testing was  performed in vitro in human lymphoblastoid TK6 cells and in primary human blood  cells. For cytotoxicity testing, relative growth activity, trypan blue  exclusion, (3)H-thymidine incorporation and cytokinesis-block proliferation  index were assessed. Genotoxicity was evaluated by the alkaline comet assay for  detection of strand breaks and oxidized purines. Particle characterization was  performed in the culture medium. Cellular uptake, morphology and pathology were  evaluated by electron microscopy. U-Fe3O4 NPs were found not to be cytotoxic  (considering interference of NPs with proliferation test) or genotoxic under our  experimental conditions. In contrast, OC-Fe3O4 NPs were cytotoxic in a  dose-dependent manner, and also induced DNA damage, indicating genotoxic  potential. Intrinsic properties of sodium oleate were excluded as a cause of the  toxic effect. Electron microscopy data were consistent with the cytotoxicity  results. Coating clearly changed the behaviour and cellular uptake of the NPs,  inducing pathological morphological changes in the cells.', 'OBJECTIVE: To investigate the possibility of placenta mesenchymal stem cells  (PMSCs) differentiation into dermal fibroblast, and the potency of PMSCs used in  cutaneous wound healing and stored as seed cells. METHODS: Enzyme digestion method was used to obtain PMSCs, and PMSCs were  amplified after culture in vitro. Flow cytometry assay, osteogenic and  adipogenic differentiation were done for MSCs identification. The induction  medium composed of DMEM/F12 + 50 microg/ml VC + 100 ng/ml connective tissue  growth factor (CTGF) was added into the 24-well plate for 16 days induction  period. Pictures were taken to record morphologic change. Immunofluorescence  tests were performed to detect Vimentin, FSP-1, collagen I , collagen III,  desmin and laminin expression before and after induction. At the same time  osteogenic and adipogenic differentiation were used to assay the differentiation  ability change after induction. The induced dermal fibroblasts were frozen in  liquid nitrogen and recovery and trypan blue was used to detect cell viability. RESULTS: After CTGF induction, PMSCs got obvious fibroblasts morphology, the  protein level of Vimentin, FSP-1, collagen I, collagen III and Laminin  increased, PMSCs started to express Desmin, the dermal fibroblasts specific  proteins, and osteogenic and adipogenic differentiation ability was diminished.  PMSCs were successfully induced into dermal fibroblasts, and these induced cells  could get a high cell viability ( more than 90% ) after recovery. CONCLUSIONS: PMSCs could be induced into dermal fibroblasts by CTGF in vitro.  PMSCs have the potential application in skin wound healing, and can be used as  seed cells of dermal fibroblasts.']]]","Trypan blue is used to assess cell viability by excluding live cells from staining, allowing dead cells to remain unstained and appear blue under a microscope.","[{'Exact': array([ 1.32550638,  7.33574211, -1.26027252,  5.05742672,  4.17920019,

Is there any genetic determinant of hair pigmentation that could be useful in forensic analyses?,"[[[""Genetic information in forensic studies is largely limited to CODIS data and the  ability to match samples and assign them to an individual. However, there are  circumstances, in which a given DNA sample does not match anyone in the CODIS  database, and no other information about the donor is available. In this study,  we determined 75 SNPs in 24 genes (previously implicated in human or animal  pigmentation studies) for the analysis of single- and multi-locus associations  with hair, skin, and eye color in 789 individuals of various ethnic backgrounds.  Using multiple linear regression modeling, five SNPs in five genes were found to  account for large proportions of pigmentation variation in hair, skin, and eyes  in our across-population analyses. Thus, these models may be of predictive value  to determine an individual's pigmentation type from a forensic sample,  independent of ethnic origin."", 'Prediction of physical appearance based on genetic analysis is a very attractive  prospect for forensic investigations. Recent studies have proved that there is a  significant association between some genetic variants of the melanocortin 1  receptor (MC1R) gene and red hair color. The present study focuses on the  potential forensic applicability of variation within this pigment-related gene.  Sequencing of the complete MC1R gene was performed on a group of red-haired  individuals and controls with different pigmentation. A major role in  determination of red hair color is played by two MC1R variants--C451T and C478T.  The optimized minisequencing assay for genotyping of the above positions and  three other important red hair-related MC1R polymorphisms, C252A, G425A, and  G880C was successfully applied to analyze typical forensic specimens.  Determination of a homozygous or heterozygous combination can be a good  predictor of both red hair color and fair skin of a subject.', 'The prediction of an individuals physical appearance from small biological  samples, such as those collected from crime scenes may still sound like science  fiction, but how close are we to achieving this goal? This review provides a  brief introduction to the areas under investigation for direct and indirect  phenotypic inference from DNA alone and suggests some sources of further reading  for those interested in gaining a more in-depth knowledge of this complex  subject.', 'Cutaneous pigmentation is a major determinant of the cutaneous response to  ultraviolet radiation, and consequently of the risk of developing skin cancer.  Over the past 10 years, several genes involved in melanogenesis have been  identified, including the melanocortin 1 receptor gene. Recent work on the  melanocortin 1 receptor suggests that it is a key player in determining whether  eumelanin or pheomelanin is predominantly produced both in vitro and in vivo. In  the mouse, variants of this receptor, which differ in their ability to activate  adenylyl cyclase, are associated with different coat colors. In humans,  melanocortin 1 receptor variants are associated with red hair and fair skin, and  work in progress from our laboratory suggests that certain melanocortin 1  receptor variants may preferentially be associated with hair color rather than  skin type. In addition, melanocortin 1 receptor variants are a risk factor,  possibly independent of skin type, for melanoma susceptibility.', 'We have examined MC1R variant allele frequencies in the general population of  South East Queensland and in a collection of adolescent dizygotic and  monozygotic twins and family members to define statistical associations with  hair and skin color, freckling, and mole count. Results of these studies are  consistent with a linear recessive allelic model with multiplicative penetrance  in the inheritance of red hair. Four alleles, D84E, R151C, R160W, and D294H, are  strongly associated with red hair and fair skin with multinomial regression  analysis showing odds ratios of 63, 118, 50, and 94, respectively. An additional  three low-penetrance alleles V60L, V92M, and R163Q have odds ratios 6, 5, and 2  relative to the wild-type allele. To address the cellular effects of MC1R  variant alleles in signal transduction, we expressed these receptors in  permanently transfected HEK293 cells. Measurement of receptor activity via  induction of a cAMP-responsive luciferase reporter gene found that the R151C and  R160W receptors were active in the presence of NDP-MSH ligand, but at much  reduced levels compared with that seen with the wild-type receptor. The ability  to stimulate phosphorylation of the cAMP response element binding protein (CREB)  transcription factor was also apparent in all stimulated MC1R variant  allele-expressing HEK293 cell extracts as assessed by immunoblotting. In  contrast, human melanoma cell lines showed wide variation in the their ability  to undergo cAMP-mediated CREB phosphorylation. Culture of human melanocytes of  known MC1R genotype may provide the best experimental approach to examine the  functional consequences for each MC1R variant allele. With this objective, we  have established more than 300 melanocyte cell strains of defined MC1R genotype.', ""In forensic analysis predictive tests for external visible characteristics (or  EVCs), including inference of iris color, represent a potentially useful tool to  guide criminal investigations. Two recent studies, both focused on forensic  testing, have analyzed single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) genotypes underlying  common eye color variation (Mengel-From et al., Forensic Sci. Int. Genet. 4:323  and Walsh et al., Forensic Sci. Int. Genet. 5:170). Each study arrived at  different recommendations for eye color predictive tests aiming to type the most  closely associated SNPs, although both confirmed rs12913832 in HERC2 as the key  predictor, widely recognized as the most strongly associated marker with blue  and brown iris colors. Differences between these two studies in identification  of other eye color predictors may partly arise from varying approaches to  assigning phenotypes, notably those not unequivocally blue or dark brown and  therefore occupying an intermediate iris color continuum. We have developed two  single base extension assays typing 37 SNPs in pigmentation-associated genes to  study SNP-genotype based prediction of eye, skin, and hair color variation.  These assays were used to test the performance of different sets of eye color  predictors in 416 subjects from six populations of north and south Europe. The  presence of a complex and continuous range of intermediate phenotypes distinct  from blue and brown eye colors was confirmed by establishing eye color  populations compared to genetic clusters defined using Structure software. Our  study explored the effect of an expanded SNP combination beyond six markers has  on the ability to predict eye color in a forensic test without extending the SNP  assay excessively - thus maintaining a balance between the test's predictive  value and an ability to reliably type challenging DNA with a multiplex of  manageable size. Our evaluation used AUC analysis (area under the receiver  operating characteristic curves) and naïve Bayesian likelihood-based  classification approaches. To provide flexibility in SNP-based eye color  predictive tests in forensic applications we modified an online Bayesian  classifier, originally developed for genetic ancestry analysis, to provide a  straightforward system to assign eye color likelihoods from a SNP profile  combining additional informative markers from the predictors analyzed by our  study plus those of Walsh and Mengel-From. Two advantages of the online  classifier is the ability to submit incomplete SNP profiles, a common occurrence  when typing challenging DNA, and the ability to handle physically linked SNPs  showing independent effect, by allowing the user to input frequencies from SNP  pairs or larger combinations. This system was used to include the submission of  frequency data for the SNP pair rs12913832 and rs1129038: indicated by our study  to be the two SNPs most closely associated to eye color."", 'The prediction of an individuals physical appearance from small biological  samples, such as those collected from crime scenes may still sound like science  fiction, but how close are we to achieving this goal?

A demonstrated lack of linkage to SILV,  the strong candidate gene for silver, led to the initiation of a genome scan  utilizing 2 pedigrees segregating for silver coat color. Linkage mapping defined  a genomic region for SILVER as a 3.3-Mb region, (95.87-99.21 Mb) on chromosome  D2, (peak logarithm of the odds = 10.5, = 0), which displays conserved synteny  to a genomic interval between 118.58 and 121.85 Mb on chromosome 10 in the human  genome. In the domestic cat, mutations at the SILVER locus suppress the  development of pigment in the hair, but in contrast to other mammalian silver  variants, there is an apparently greater influence on the production of  pheomelanin than eumelanin pigment. The mapping of a novel locus for SILVER  offers much promise in identifying a gene that may help elucidate aspects of  pheomelanogenesis, a pathway that has been very elusive, and illustrates the  promise of the cat genome project in increasing our understanding of basic  biological processes of general relevance for mammals.']]]","Yes, there are genetic determinants of hair pigmentation that could be useful in forensic analyses.

What is the lay name of the treatment for CCSVI (chronic cerebro-spinal venous insufficiency)  in multiple sclerosis.,"[[[""BACKGROUND: Multiple sclerosis (MS) is a leading cause of neurological  disability in young adults. The most widely accepted hypothesis regarding its  pathogenesis is that it is an immune-mediated disease. It has been hypothesised  more recently that chronic venous congestion may be an important factor in the  pathogenesis of MS. This concept has been named 'chronic cerebrospinal venous  insufficiency' (CCSVI) and is characterised by stenoses of either the internal  jugular or azygos veins, or both. It is suggested that these stenoses restrict  the normal blood flow from the brain, causing the deposition of iron in the  brain and the eventual triggering of an auto-immune response. The proposed  treatment for CCSVI is percutaneous transluminal angioplasty, also known as the  'liberation procedure', which is claimed to improve the blood flow in the brain  thereby alleviating some of the symptoms of MS. OBJECTIVES: To assess the effects of percutaneous transluminal angioplasty for  the treatment of CCSVI in people with MS. SEARCH METHODS: We searched the following databases up to June 2012: The  Cochrane Multiple Sclerosis and Rare Diseases of the Central Nervous System  Group Specialised Register, CENTRAL in The Cochrane Library 2012, Issue 5,  MEDLINE (from 1946), EMBASE (from 1974), and reference lists of articles. We  also searched several online trials registries for ongoing trials. SELECTION CRITERIA: Randomised controlled trials assessing the effects of  percutaneous transluminal angioplasty in adults with multiple sclerosis, that  have been diagnosed to have CCSVI. DATA COLLECTION AND ANALYSIS: Our searches retrieved 159 references, six of  which were to ongoing trials. Based on assessment of the title or abstract, or  both, we excluded all of the studies, with the exception of one which was  evaluated following examination of the full text report. However, this study  also did not meet our inclusion criteria and was subsequently excluded. MAIN RESULTS: No randomised controlled trials met our inclusion criteria. AUTHORS' CONCLUSIONS: There is currently no high level evidence to support or  refute the efficacy or safety of percutaneous transluminal angioplasty for  treatment of CCSVI in people with MS. Clinical practice should be guided by  evidence supported by well-designed randomised controlled trials: closure of  some of the gaps in the evidence may be feasible at the time of completion of  the six ongoing clinical trials."", ""BACKGROUND: Multiple sclerosis (MS) is a chronic inflammatory demyelinating  disease of the central nervous system with a disabling progressive course.  Chronic cerebrospinal venous insufficiency (CCSVI) has recently been described  as a vascular condition characterized by restricted venous outflow from the  brain, mainly due to blockages of the internal jugular and azygos veins. Despite  a wide variability among studies, it has been found to be associated with MS.  Data from a few small case series suggest possible improvement of the clinical  course and quality of life by performing percutaneous balloon angioplasty (PTA)  of the stenotic veins. STUDY DESIGN AND METHODS: This is a multicenter, randomized, parallel group,  blinded, sham-controlled trial to assess the efficacy and safety of PTA.  Participants with relapsing remitting MS or secondary progressive MS and a  sonographic diagnosis of CCSVI will be enrolled after providing their informed  consent. Each participant will be centrally randomized to receive catheter  venography and PTA or catheter venography and sham PTA. Two primary end points  with respect to efficacy at 12 months are (1) a combined end point obtained  through the integration of five functional indicators, walking, balance, manual  dexterity, bladder control, and visual acuity, objectively measured by  instruments; and (2) number of new brain lesions measured by T2-weighted MRI  sequences. Secondary end points include annual relapse rate, change in Expanded  Disability Status Scale score, proportion of patients with zero, one or two, or  more than two relapses; fatigue; anxiety and depression; general cognitive  state; memory/attention/calculus; impact of bladder incontinence; and adverse  events. Six hundred seventy-nine patients will be recruited. The follow-up is  scheduled at 12 months. Patients, treating neurologists, trained outcome  assessors, and the statistician in charge of data analysis will be masked to the  assigned treatment. DISCUSSION: The study will provide an answer regarding the efficacy of PTA on  patients' functional disability in balance, motor, sensory, visual and bladder  function, cognitive status, and emotional status, which are meaningful clinical  outcomes, beyond investigating the effects on inflammation. In fact, an  important part of patients' expectations, sustained and amplified by anecdotal  data, has to do precisely with these functional aspects.

Although  his theory and the associated treatment (""liberation therapy"") received little  more than passing interest in the international scientific and medical  communities, his ideas became the source of tremendous public and political  tension in Canada. The story moved rapidly from mainstream media to social  networking sites. CCSVI and liberation therapy swiftly garnered support among  patients and triggered remarkable and relentless advocacy efforts. Policy makers  have responded in a variety of ways to the public\'s call for action. DISCUSSION: We present three different perspectives on this evolving story, that  of a health journalist who played a key role in the media coverage of this  issue, that of a health law and policy scholar who has closely observed the  unfolding public policy developments across the country, and that of a medical  ethicist who sits on an expert panel convened by the MS Society of Canada and  the Canadian Institutes of Health Research to assess the evidence as it emerges. SUMMARY: This story raises important questions about resource allocation and  priority setting in scientific research and science policy. The growing power of  social media represents a new level of citizen engagement and advocacy, and  emphasizes the importance of open debate about the basis on which such policy  choices are made. It also highlights the different ways evidence may be  understood, valued and utilized by various stakeholders and further emphasizes  calls to improve science communication so as to support balanced and informed  decision-making.', 'Chronic cerebrospinal venous insufficiency (CCSVI) is a hypothesis through which  cerebral venous drainage abnormalities contribute towards the pathogenesis of  multiple sclerosis. CCSVI venoplasty is already practised worldwide. We report  the case of a 33-year-old lady with multiple sclerosis who underwent left  internal jugular venoplasty resulting in iatrogenic jugular thrombosis requiring  open thrombectomy for symptom relief. This occurred without insertion of a stent  and while fully anticoagulated. Clinicians should be aware that endovenous  treatment of CCSVI could cause paradoxical deterioration of cerebral venous  drainage. Patients with complications post venoplasty are now presenting to  geographically distant vascular units.', 'Multiple sclerosis (MS) is an inflammatory demyelinating disease of the central  nervous system (CNS) by an unknown pathogenesis. MR venography and postmortem  studies have demonstrated a topographic correspondence between multiple  sclerosis (MS) plaques and the cerebral venous system pathology. In recent  observational studies performed on patients from distinctive gene pools, the  prevalence of chronic cerebrospinal venous insufficiency (CCSVI) in MS ranged  from 56% to 100%. Endovascular treatment (percutaneous transluminal angioplasty  (PTA) with or without stenting) of CCSVI was reported to be feasible with a  minor complication rate. In 4 patients with different forms of multiple  sclerosis venography was performed that revealed stenosis of the proximal region  of the jugular vein (right or left). Percutaneous transluminal balloon  angioplasty (PTA) was performed in all patients. There were no complications and  mean stenosis was reduced after PTA from 59.75% to 36.75%. Follow-up included  clinical observations and magnetic resonance imaging (MRI). In all the cases we  observed positive remission of the disease, the first ever documented case of  MRI index improvement. PTA seems to be an effective treatment for patients with  CCVI and multiple sclerosis, However, randomized studies are warranted to  establish the efficacy of this new treatment for MS.', ""PURPOSE: To assess the safety of endovascular treatment of chronic cerebrospinal  venous insufficiency (CCSVI) in patients with multiple sclerosis (MS). MATERIALS AND METHODS: A total of 72 patients with CCSVI and MS (44 with  relapsing remitting--RR, 4 with primary progressive, 20 with secondary  progressive and 4 with benign MS) underwent percutaneous angioplasty. Outcome  measures were colour Doppler ultrasonography parameters, gradient pressure at  the vein abnormality level, postoperative complications, re-stenosis, disease  severity scored by means of Expanded Disability Status Scale (EDSS) and  patients' assumption of disease status. Controls were done after one month on 72  patients, six months on 69 patients and one year on 61 patients, respectively  (the average follow-up was 11 months). RESULTS: There were no postoperative complications. Colour Doppler  ultrasonography showed significant improvement in cross-sectional area  parameters (P\u2009<\u20090.05) and significant decrease in confluence velocity values  (P\u2009<\u20090.05). Postoperative gradient pressure decreased, in internal jugular vein  (IJV) significantly (P\u2009<\u20090.05). Re-stenosis appeared in 5.3% of patients. EDSS  score was significantly improved (P\u2009<\u20090.01) and about half of patients reported  significant or mild improvement in disease status and none of them worsening of  symptoms. CONCLUSION: Endovascular treatment of the IJV and azygous veins in patients with  CCSVI and MS is a safe procedure with no post-procedural complications followed  by significant improvement of IJV flow haemodynamic parameters and decrease in  the EDSS score. Whether CCSVI percutaneous treatment might affect clinical  improvement in patients suffering from MS is yet to be seen after completion of  major multicentric clinical trials, still it seems like that this procedure is  not negligible."", 'Chronic cerebrospinal venous insufficiency (CCSVI) is a putative new theory that  has been suggested by some to have a direct causative relation with the  symptomatology associated with multiple sclerosis (MS) [1]. The core foundation  of this theory is that there is abnormal venous drainage from the brain due to  outflow obstruction in the draining jugular vein and/or azygos veins. This  abnormal venous drainage, which is characterised by special ultrasound criteria,  called the ""venous hemodynamic insufficiency severity score"" (VHISS), is said to  cause intracerebral flow disturbance or outflow problems that lead to  periventricular deposits [2]. In the CCSVI theory, these deposits have a great  similarity to the iron deposits seen around the veins in the legs in patients  with chronic deep vein thrombosis. Zamboni, who first described this new theory,  has promoted balloon dilatation to treat the outflow problems, thereby curing  CCSVI and by the same token alleviating MS complaints. However, this theory does  not fit into the existing bulk of scientific data concerning the pathophysiology  of MS. In contrast, there is increasing worldwide acceptance of CCSVI and the  associated balloon dilatation treatment, even though there is no supporting  scientific evidence. Furthermore, most of the information we have comes from one  source only. The treatment is called ""liberation treatment,"" and the results of  the treatment can be watched on YouTube. There are well-documented testimonies  by MS patients who have gained improvement in their personal quality of life  (QOL) after treatment. However, there are no data available from patients who  underwent unsuccessful treatments with which to obtain a more balanced view. The  current forum for the reporting of success in treating CCSVI and thus MS seems  to be the Internet. At the CIRCE office and the MS Centre in Amsterdam, we  receive approximately 10 to 20 inquiries a month about this treatment. In  addition, many interventional radiologists, who are directly approached by MS  patients, contact the Cardiovascular and Interventional Radiological Society of  Europe (CIRSE) for advice. Worldwide, several centres are actively promoting and  performing balloon dilatation, with or without stenting, for CCSVI. Thus far, no  trial data are available, and there is currently no randomized controlled trial  (RCT) in progress Therefore, the basis for this new treatment rests on anecdotal  evidence and successful testimonies by patients on the Internet. CIRSE believes  that this is not a sound basis on which to offer a new treatment, which could  have possible procedure-related complications, to an often desperate patient  population.', ""Chronic cerebrospinal venous insufficiency (CCSVI) has been implicated as a  contributing factor to multiple sclerosis (MS). This theory is strongly debated  within the neurology and radiology communities. This report presents the case of  a 45-year-old man with known MS and suspected CCSVI who had undergone previous  internal jugular angioplasty and stenting. The patient reported dramatic  improvement of symptoms after intervention. The stent thrombosed despite  antithrombotic medication, and several endovascular interventions failed to  restore long-term patency. Open venous reconstruction of the internal jugular  vein was performed with a spiral graft from the saphenous vein. The patient's  symptoms improved for several weeks until the venous reconstruction occluded.  This case is the first reported open venous reconstruction for suspected CCSVI."", 'Chronic impaired venous outflow from the central nervous system has recently  been claimed to be associated with multiple sclerosis (MS) pathology. This  resulted in the term chronic cerebrospinal venous insufficiency (CCSVI) in MS.  The concept of CCSVI is based on sonography studies showing that impaired venous  outflow leading to pathological reflux is almost exclusively present in MS  patients but not in healthy controls. Based on these findings, a new  pathophysiological concept has been introduced suggesting that chronic venous  outflow obstruction and venous reflux in the CNS result in pathological iron  depositions leading to inflammation and neurodegeneration. The theory of CCSVI  in MS has rapidly generated tremendous interest in the media and among patients  and the scientific community. In particular, the potential shift in treatment  concepts possibly leading to an interventional treatment approach including  balloon angioplasty and venous stent placement is currently being debated.  However, results from recent studies involving several imaging modalities have  raised substantial concerns regarding the CCSVI concept in MS. In this review  article, we explain the concept of CCSVI in MS and discuss this hypothesis in  the context of MS pathophysiology and imaging studies which have tried to  reproduce or refute this theory. In addition, we draw some major conclusions  focusing in particular on the crucial question as to whether interventional  treatment options are expedient. In conclusion, the present conclusive data  confuting the theory of CCSVI in MS should lead to reluctance with respect to  the interventional treatment of possible venous anomalies in MS patients.', 'Multiple sclerosis (MS) is a disorder characterized by damage to the myelin  sheath insulation of nerve cells of the brain and spinal cord affecting nerve  impulses which can lead to numerous physical and cognitive disabilities. The  disease, which affects over 500,000 people in the United States alone, is widely  believed to be an autoimmune condition potentially triggered by an antecedant  event such as a viral infection, environmental factors, a genetic defect or a  combination of each. Chronic cerebrospinal venous insufficiency (CCSVI) is a  condition characterized by abnormal venous drainage from the central nervous  system that has been theorized to have a possible role in the pathogenesis and  symptomatology of MS (1). A significant amount of attention has been given to  this theory as a possible explanation for the etiology of symptoms related to MS  patients suffering from this disease. The work of Dr. Zamboni, et al, who  reported that treating the venous stenoses causing CCSVI with angioplasty  resulting in significant improvement in the symptoms and quality of life of  patients with MS (2) has led to further interest in this theory and potential  treatment. The article presented describes endovascular techniques employed to  diagnose and treat patients with MS and CCSVI.']]]","The lay name of the treatment for CCSVI in multiple sclerosis is ""liberation procedure"".","[{'Exact': array([21.91806506, -1.80801115,  3.48703439, -2.42846979, -0.83808406,

Is phospholamban a regulatory/inhibitory protein of the Ca ATPase SERCA?,"[[['Heart disease remains the leading cause of death and disability in the Western  world. Current therapies aim at treating the symptoms rather than the  subcellular mechanisms, underlying the etiology and pathological remodeling in  heart failure. A universal characteristic, contributing to the decreased  contractile performance in human and experimental failing hearts, is impaired  calcium sequestration into the sarcoplasmic reticulum (SR). SR calcium uptake is  mediated by a Ca(2+)-ATPase (SERCA2), whose activity is reversibly regulated by  phospholamban (PLN). Dephosphorylated PLN is an inhibitor of SERCA and  phosphorylation of PLN relieves this inhibition. However, the initial simple  view of a PLN/SERCA regulatory complex has been modified by our recent  identification of SUMO, S100 and the histidine-rich Ca-binding protein as  regulators of SERCA activity. In addition, PLN activity is regulated by 2  phosphoproteins, the inhibitor-1 of protein phosphatase 1 and the small heat  shock protein 20, which affect the overall SERCA-mediated Ca-transport. This  review will highlight the regulatory mechanisms of cardiac contractility by the  multimeric SERCA/PLN-ensemble and the potential for new therapeutic avenues  targeting this complex by using small molecules and gene transfer methods.', ""Increases in diastolic Ca2+ and impaired relaxation in failing hearts have been  suggested to reflect the deteriorated function of the sarcoplasmic reticulum  Ca-ATPase (SERCA2), whose activity is regulated by phospholamban (PLN). PLN is a  reversible inhibitor of SERCA2's Ca2+ affinity and cardiac contractility.  Studies in genetically altered mouse models have demonstrated that the levels  and the degree of PLN phosphorylation are critical in modulating basal Ca2+  handling and contractility. Correspondingly, the depressed contractility in  experimental and human heart failure is partially attributed to increased  inhibition by PLN due to: (a) increases in PLN/SERCA2; and (b) decreases in PLN  phosphorylation. The attenuated PLN phosphorylation is associated with increased  type 1 phosphatase, which reflects dephosphorylation or inactivation of its  inhibitor 1. Indeed PLN ablation was successful in rescuing cardiac remodelling  and dysfunction in several heart failure mouse models, and inhibition of the  phosphatase activity restored contractile parameters in failing rat hearts.  Recently, two human PLN mutations, associated with either absence or sustained  dephosphorylation of PLN, were linked to dilated cardiomyopathy. Thus, PLN  modulation appears to be of paramount importance in humans, and further  investigation into PLN function in higher mammalian species may provide insights  into its potential as a therapeutic modality in heart failure."", 'Phospholamban (PLN) is a type II membrane protein that inhibits the sarcoplasmic  reticulum Ca(2+)-ATPase (SERCA), thereby regulating calcium homeostasis in  cardiac muscle. In membranes, PLN forms pentamers that have been proposed to  function either as a storage for active monomers or as ion channels. Here, we  report the T-state structure of pentameric PLN solved by a hybrid solution and  solid-state NMR method. In lipid bilayers, PLN adopts a pinwheel topology with a  narrow hydrophobic pore, which excludes ion transport. In the T state, the  cytoplasmic amphipathic helices (domains Ia) are absorbed into the lipid bilayer  with the transmembrane domains arranged in a left-handed coiled-coil  configuration, crossing the bilayer with a tilt angle of approximately 11° with  respect to the membrane normal. The tilt angle difference between the monomer  and pentamer is approximately 13°, showing that intramembrane helix-helix  association forces dominate over the hydrophobic mismatch, driving the overall  topology of the transmembrane assembly. Our data reveal that both topology and  function of PLN are shaped by the interactions with lipids, which fine-tune the  regulation of SERCA.', '1. Phospholamban (PLB) is an inhibitor of the sarcoplasmic reticulum (SR)  Ca2+-ATPase (SERCA). Its presence and/or functional significance in  contractility of bladder, a smooth muscle tissue particularly dependent on SR  function, is unknown. We investigated this by measuring the effects of carbachol  (CCh) on force and [Ca2+]i in bladder from mice in which the PLB gene was  ablated (PLB-KO mice). In the PLB-KO bladder, the maximum increases in [Ca2+]i  and force were significantly decreased (41.5 and 47.4 % of WT), and the EC50  values increased. 2. Inhibition of SERCA with cyclopiazonic acid (CPA) abolished  these differences between WT and PLB-KO bladder, localizing the effects to the  SR. 3. To determine whether these effects were specific to PLB, we generated  mice with smooth-muscle-specific expression of PLB (PLB-SMOE mice), using the  SMP8 alpha-actin promoter. Western blot analysis of PLB-SMOE mice showed  approximately an eightfold overexpression of PLB while SERCA was downregulated  12-fold. 4. In PLB-SMOE bladders, in contrast, the response of [Ca2+]i and force  to CCh was significantly increased and the EC50 values were decreased. CPA had  little affect on the CCh-induced increases in [Ca2+]i and force in PLB-SMOE  bladder. 5. These results show that alteration of the PLB:SERCA ratio can  significantly modulate smooth muscle [Ca2+]i. Importantly, our data show that  PLB can play a major role in modulation of bladder contractility.', 'Phospholamban (PLB) inhibits the sarcoplasmic reticulum (SR) Ca(2+)-ATPase  (SERCA), and this inhibition is relieved by Ca(2+) calmodulin-dependent protein  kinase II (CaM kinase II) phosphorylation. We previously reported significant  differences in contractility, SR Ca(2+) release, and CaM kinase II activity in  gastric fundus smooth muscles as a result of PLB phosphorylation by CaM kinase  II. In this study, we used PLB-knockout (PLB-KO) mice to directly examine the  effect of PLB absence on contractility, CaM kinase II activity, and  intracellular Ca(2+) waves in gastric antrum smooth muscles. The frequencies and  amplitudes of spontaneous phasic contractions were elevated in antrum smooth  muscle strips from PLB-KO mice. Bethanecol increased the amplitudes of phasic  contractions in antrum smooth muscles from both control and PLB-KO mice.  Caffeine decreased and cyclopiazonic acid (CPA) increased the basal tone of  antrum smooth muscle strips from PLB-KO mice, but the effects were less  pronounced compared with control strips. The CaM kinase II inhibitor KN-93 was  less effective at inhibiting caffeine-induced relaxation in antrum smooth muscle  strips from PLB-KO mice. CaM kinase II autonomous activity was elevated, and not  further increased by caffeine, in antrum smooth muscles from PLB-KO mice.  Similarly, the intracellular Ca(2+) wave frequency was elevated, and not further  increased by caffeine, in antrum smooth muscles from PLB-KO mice. These findings  suggest that PLB is an important modulator of gastric antrum smooth muscle  contractility by modulation of SR Ca(2+) release and CaM kinase II activity.', 'Phospholamban (PLB) is an integral membrane protein regulating Ca(2+) transport  through inhibitory interaction with sarco(endo)plasmic reticulum calcium ATPase  (SERCA). The Asn27 to Ala (N27A) mutation of PLB has been shown to function as a  superinhibitor of the affinity of SERCA for Ca(2+) and of cardiac contractility  in vivo. The effects of this N27A mutation on the side-chain and backbone  dynamics of PLB were investigated with (2)H and (15)N solid-state NMR  spectroscopy in phospholipid multilamellar vesicles (MLVs). (2)H and (15)N NMR  spectra indicate that the N27A mutation does not significantly change the  side-chain or backbone dynamics of the transmembrane and cytoplasmic domains  when compared to wild-type PLB. However, dynamic changes are observed for the  hinge region, in which greater mobility is observed for the CD(3)-labeled Ala24  N27A-PLB. The increased dynamics in the hinge region of PLB upon N27A mutation  may allow the cytoplasmic helix to more easily interact with the Ca(2+)-ATPase;  thus, showing increased inhibition of Ca(2+)-ATPase.', 'Phospholamban has been suggested to be a key regulator of cardiac sarcoplasmic  reticulum (SR) Ca cycling and contractility and a potential therapeutic target  in restoring the depressed Ca cycling in failing hearts. Our understanding of  the function of phospholamban stems primarily from studies in genetically  altered mouse models. To evaluate the significance of this protein in larger  mammalian species, which exhibit Ca cycling properties similar to humans, we  overexpressed phospholamban in adult rabbit cardiomyocytes. Adenoviral-mediated  gene transfer, at high multiplicities of infection, resulted in an insignificant  1.22-fold overexpression of phospholamban. There were no effects on twitch  Ca-transient amplitude or decay under basal or isoproterenol-stimulated  conditions. Furthermore, the SR Ca load and Na/Ca exchanger function were not  altered. These apparent differences between phospholamban overexpression in  rabbit compared with previous findings in the mouse may be due to a  significantly higher (1.5-fold) endogenous phospholamban-to-sarco(endo)plasmic  reticulum Ca-ATPase (SERCA) 2a ratio and potential functional saturation of  SERCA2a by phospholamban in rabbit cardiomyocytes. The findings suggest that  important species-dependent differences in phospholamban regulation of SERCA2a  occur. In larger mammals, a higher fraction of SERCA2a pumps are regulated by  phospholamban, and this may influence therapeutic strategies to enhance cardiac  contractility and functional cardiac reserve.', 'The sarco(endo)plasmic reticulum calcium ATPase (SERCA) is regulated in a  tissue-dependent manner via interaction with the short integral membrane  proteins phospholamban (PLN) and sarcolipin (SLN). Although defects in SERCA  activity are known to cause heart failure, the regulatory mechanisms imposed by  PLN and SLN could have clinical implications for both heart and skeletal muscle  diseases. PLN and SLN have significant sequence homology in their transmembrane  regions, suggesting a similar mode of binding to SERCA. However, unlike PLN, SLN  has a conserved C-terminal luminal tail composed of five amino acids  ((27)RSYQY), which may contribute to a distinct SERCA regulatory mechanism. We  have functionally characterized alanine mutants of the C-terminal tail of SLN  using co-reconstituted proteoliposomes of SERCA and SLN. We found that Arg(27)  and Tyr(31) are essential for SLN function. We also tested the effect of a  truncated variant of SLN (Arg(27)stop) and extended chimeras of PLN with the  five luminal residues of SLN added to its C terminus. The Arg(27)stop form of  SLN resulted in loss of function, whereas the PLN chimeras resulted in  superinhibition with characteristics of both PLN and SLN. Based on our results,  we propose that the C-terminal tail of SLN is a distinct, essential domain in  the regulation of SERCA and that the functional properties of the SLN tail can  be transferred to PLN.', 'Sarco(endo)plasmic reticulum Ca(2+)ATPase (SERCA) pump activity is modulated by  phospholamban (PLB) and sarcolipin (SLN) in cardiac and skeletal muscle. Recent  data suggest that SLN could play a role in muscle thermogenesis by promoting  uncoupling of the SERCA pump (Lee, A.G. (2002) Curr. Opin. Struct. Biol. 12,  547-554 and Bal, N. C., Maurya, S. K., Sopariwala, D. H., Sahoo, S. K., Gupta,  S. C., Shaikh, S. A., Pant, M., Rowland, L. A., Bombardier, E., Goonasekera, S.  A., Tupling, A. R., Molkentin, J. D., and Periasamy, M. (2012) Nat. Med. 18,  1575-1579), but the mechanistic details are unknown. To better define how  binding of SLN to SERCA promotes uncoupling of SERCA, we compared SLN and SERCA1  interaction with that of PLB in detail. The homo-bifunctional cross-linker  (1,6-bismaleimidohexane) was employed to detect dynamic protein interaction  during the SERCA cycle. Our studies reveal that SLN differs significantly from  PLB: 1) SLN primarily affects the Vmax of SERCA-mediated Ca(2+) uptake but not  the pump affinity for Ca(2+); 2) SLN can bind to SERCA in the presence of high  Ca(2+), but PLB can only interact to the ATP-bound Ca(2+)-free E2 state; and 3)  unlike PLB, SLN interacts with SERCA throughout the kinetic cycle and promotes  uncoupling of the SERCA pump. Using SERCA transmembrane mutants, we additionally  show that PLB and SLN can bind to the same groove but interact with a different  set of residues on SERCA. These data collectively suggest that SLN is  functionally distinct from PLB; its ability to interact with SERCA in the  presence of Ca(2+) causes uncoupling of the SERCA pump and increased heat  production.', 'Phospholamban is an endogenous inhibitor of sarcoplasmic reticulum calcium  ATPase and plays a prime role in cardiac contractility and relaxation.  Phospholamban may be a candidate gene responsible for cardiomyopathy. We  investigated genome sequence of phospholamban in patients with cardiomyopathy.  PCR-based direct sequence was performed for the promoter region and the whole  coding region of phospholamban in 87 hypertrophic, 10 dilated, and 2 restricted  cardiomyopathic patients. We found a heterozygous single nucleotide transition  from A to G at -77-bp upstream of the transcription start site in the  phospholamban promoter region of one patient with familial hypertrophic  cardiomyopathy.

Is galcanezumab effective for treatment of migraine?,"[[['OBJECTIVE: This meta-analysis was performed to evaluate the efficacy and safety  of monoclonal antibodies against calcitonin gene-related peptide (CGRP) for  episodic migraine prevention. METHODS: MEDLINE, EMBASE, Web of Science, and the Cochrane Library were searched  from inception to April 2018. Studies considered to be eligible were randomized  controlled trials about efficacy and safety of calcitonin gene-related peptide  monoclonal antibody for episodic migraine prevention. RESULTS: Eight randomized controlled trials involving 2292 patients were  included. The outcomes of this meta-analysis presented that CGRP monoclonal  antibodies for preventive treatment of episodic migraine significantly reduced  the monthly migraine days from baseline [weighted mean difference  (WMD)\u2009=\u2009-\u20091.52; 95%CI, -\u20091.92 to -\u20091.11; Z\u2009=\u20097.40; P\u2009<\u20090.001] and monthly acute  migraine-specific medication consumption from baseline [WMD\u2009=\u2009-\u20091.45; 95%CI,  -\u20092.17 to -\u20090.72; Z\u2009=\u20093.93; P\u2009<\u20090.001], as compared with placebo group. CGRP  monoclonal antibodies for preventive treatment of episodic migraine  significantly increased the ≥\u200950% reduction from baseline in migraine days per  month [RR\u2009=\u20091.54; 95%CI, 1.38 to1.71; Z\u2009=\u20097.88; P\u2009<\u20090.001]. The adverse events  were similar between the CGRP monoclonal antibody group and placebo group  (P\u2009=\u20090.998). The outcomes of subgroup analysis showed that erenumab,  galcanezumab, and fremanezumab significantly reduced the monthly migraine days  from baseline and increased the ≥\u200950% reduction from baseline in migraine days  per month. Both erenumab and fremanezumab significantly reduced from baseline. CONCLUSIONS: Based on the results of this meta-analysis, CGRP monoclonal  antibodies significantly reduced the monthly migraine days and acute  migraine-specific medication. CGRP monoclonal antibodies were effective and safe  for preventive treatment of episodic migraine.', 'BACKGROUND: A substantial proportion of patients with migraine does not respond  to, or cannot tolerate, oral preventive treatments. Erenumab is a novel  CGRP-receptor antibody with preventive efficacy in migraine. We assessed its  efficacy and tolerability in patients with episodic migraine in whom previous  treatment with two-to-four migraine preventives had been unsuccessful. METHODS: LIBERTY was a 12-week, double-blind, placebo-controlled randomised  study at 59 sites in 16 countries. Eligible patients were aged 18-65 years and  had a history of episodic migraine with or without aura for at least 12 months,  had migraine for an average of 4-14 days per month during the 3 months before  screening, and had been treated unsuccessfully (in terms of either efficacy or  tolerability, or both) with between two and four preventive treatments. Eligible  participants were randomly assigned (1:1) to receive either erenumab 140 mg (via  two 70 mg injections) or placebo every 4 weeks subcutaneously for 12 weeks.  Randomisation was by interactive response technology and was stratified by  monthly frequency of migraine headache (4-7 vs 8-14 migraine days per month)  during the baseline phase. Cenduit generated the randomisation list and assigned  participants to groups. Participants, investigators, people doing various  assessments, and the study sponsor were masked to treatment assignment. The  primary endpoint was the proportion of patients achieving a 50% or greater  reduction in the mean number of monthly migraine days during weeks 9-12.  Efficacy was measured in the full analysis set, which included all randomly  assigned patients who started their assigned treatment and completed at least  one post-baseline monthly migraine day measurement. Safety and tolerability were  assessed by recording adverse events and by physical examination, assessment of  vital signs, clinical laboratory assessments, and electrocardiography. Safety  was assessed in all randomly assigned patients who received at least one dose of  study drug. This trial is registered with ClinicalTrials.gov, number  NCT03096834. The trial is closed to new participants, but the open-label  extension phase is ongoing. FINDINGS: Between March 20, 2017, and Oct 27, 2017, 246 participants were  randomly assigned, 121 to the erenumab group and 125 to the placebo group. 95 of  246 (39%) participants had previously unsuccessfully tried two preventive drugs,  93 (38%) had tried three, and 56 (23%) had tried four. At week 12, 36 (30%)  patients in the erenumab had a 50% or greater reduction from baseline in the  mean number of monthly migraine days, compared with 17 (14%) in the placebo  group (odds ratio 2·7 [95% CI 1·4-5·2]; p=0·002). The tolerability and safety  profiles of erenumab and placebo were similar. The most frequent  treatment-emergent adverse event was injection site pain, which occurred in  seven (6%) participants in both groups. INTERPRETATION: Compared with placebo, erenumab was efficacious in patients with  episodic migraine who previously did not respond to or tolerate between two and  four previous migraine preventive treatments. Erenumab might be an option for  patients with difficult-to-treat migraine who have high unmet needs and few  treatment options. FUNDING: Novartis Pharma.', 'PURPOSE OF REVIEW: Monoclonal antibodies (mAbs) targeting the  calcitonin-gene-related peptide (CGRP) pathway have been developed for episodic  and chronic migraine prevention, either through binding the CGRP ligand  (eptinezumab, fremanezumab, galcanezumab) or the CGRP receptor (erenumab). We  provide an update on published Phase 2 and Phase 3 trials, safety/tolerability  data, pharmacokinetics and mechanism of action of these biologicals. RECENT FINDINGS: The efficacy data from Phase 2 trials are corroborated by those  from published Phase 3 trials, with a multitude of publications expected in  2018. Review of safety data concluded there was no difference in total adverse  events or main adverse events (including upper respiratory tract infection,  nasopharyngitis, nausea, injection-site pain and back pain) between the mAbs and  placebo injections except apparently for dizziness. The site of action of these  mAbs is not fully elucidated but current insight is that their effect resides in  the periphery; a contribution of central effect(s) can however not be excluded  at present. SUMMARY: Although efficacy of all four drugs is modest over placebo in episodic  and chronic migraine prevention and overall comparable with available oral  preventive treatments, current tolerability and (short-term) safety data of this  new treatment approach certainly promise a major step forward for migraine  patients.', 'OBJECTIVE: To evaluate the efficacy and safety of galcanezumab, a humanized  monoclonal antibody that selectively binds to calcitonin gene-related peptide,  in the preventive treatment of chronic migraine. METHODS: A phase 3, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled study of  LY2951742 in patients with chronic migraine (Evaluation of Galcanezumab in the  Prevention of Chronic Migraine [REGAIN]) was a phase 3 study with a 3-month  double-blind, placebo-controlled treatment phase and a 9-month open-label  extension. Eligible patients 18 to 65 years of age with chronic migraine were  randomized 2:1:1 to monthly subcutaneous injections of placebo (n = 558),  galcanezumab 120 mg (with a 240-mg loading dose, n = 278), or galcanezumab 240  mg (n = 277). The primary endpoint was the overall mean change from baseline in  the number of monthly migraine headache days (MHDs) during the 3-month  double-blind treatment phase. RESULTS: Mean number of monthly MHDs at baseline was 19.4 for the total sample.  Both galcanezumab dose groups demonstrated greater overall mean reduction in the  number of monthly MHDs compared to placebo (placebo -2.7, galcanezumab 120 mg  -4.8, galcanezumab 240 mg -4.6) (p < 0.001 for each dose compared to placebo).  There were no clinically meaningful differences between galcanezumab doses and  placebo on any safety or tolerability outcome except for a higher incidence of  treatment-emergent injection-site reaction (p < 0.01), injection-site erythema  (p < 0.001), injection-site pruritus (p < 0.01), and sinusitis (p < 0.05) in the  galcanezumab 240-mg group relative to placebo. CONCLUSIONS: Both doses of galcanezumab were superior to placebo in reducing the  number of monthly MHDs. Galcanezumab appears efficacious, safe, and well  tolerated for the preventive treatment of chronic migraine. CLINICALTRIALSGOV IDENTIFIER: NCT02614261. CLASSIFICATION OF EVIDENCE: This interventional study provides Class I evidence  that galcanezumab is superior to placebo in the reduction of the number of  monthly MHDs.', 'The neuropeptide calcitonin gene-related peptide is well established as a key  player in the pathogenesis of migraine. Clinical studies show calcitonin  gene-related peptide levels correlate with migraine attacks, and decreases in  this neuropeptide can indicate antimigraine therapy effectiveness. Research has  revealed a wide distribution of expression sites for calcitonin gene-related  peptide in the central and peripheral nervous system. Of these, the calcitonin  gene-related peptide receptor, which binds calcitonin gene-related peptide with  high affinity, has attracted growing interest as a viable target for  antimigraine therapies. An incentive to pursue such research is the continuing  unmet medical need of patients. Triptans have offered some clinical benefit, but  many patients do not respond and these drugs have important safety  considerations. Initial calcitonin gene-related peptide-focused research led to  development of the ""gepant"" small-molecule calcitonin gene-related peptide  receptor blockers. Positive efficacy reports concerning the gepants have been  tempered by safety findings which led to the discontinuation of some of these  agents. Currently, there is considerable excitement regarding monoclonal  antibodies against calcitonin gene-related peptide (eptinezumab, galcanezumab,  fremanezumab) and the calcitonin gene-related peptide receptor (erenumab). To  date, these monoclonal antibodies have shown promising efficacy in clinical  trials, with no major safety concerns. If ongoing long-term studies show that  their efficacy can be maintained, this may herald a new era for effective  antimigraine therapies.', 'Galcanezumab is a humanized immunoglobulin G (IgG) monoclonal antibody (mAb)  indicated for the prevention of migraine that binds to calcitonin gene-related  peptide. A population pharmacokinetic (PK) analysis was performed to  characterize galcanezumab PK using data pooled from 7 clinical studies. Clinical  studies included healthy individuals and patients with episodic or chronic  migraine who were administered between 5 and 300\xa0mg galcanezumab. The PK data  were analyzed using nonlinear mixed-effects modeling. Galcanezumab  concentration-time data were described with a 1-compartment model with  first-order absorption following subcutaneous administration and linear  elimination. At the median body weight of 74 kg, the estimated population  apparent clearance (CL/F) was 0.00785 L/h (34% IIV), the apparent volume of  distribution was 7.33 L (34% IIV), and half-life was 27 days. Patient body  weight was found to have a modest effect of CL/F, with median galcanezumab  concentrations being lower in the heaviest patients compared to the lightest  patients, but this outcome was determined not to be clinically relevant in the  context of model-estimated random variability. Dosing adjusted for body weight  is not warranted in adults. Age, sex, race/ethnicity, immunogenicity,  renal/hepatic markers, and injection-site location did not affect galcanezumab  PK. In conclusion, galcanezumab exhibits PK parameters typical for an IgG mAb  administered subcutaneously. The population PK model developed in this study  demonstrates that galcanezumab exhibits linear PK that was not influenced in a  clinically relevant manner by the patient factors evaluated.', 'Treatment of migraine is on the cusp of a new era with the development of drugs  that target the trigeminal sensory neuropeptide calcitonin gene-related peptide  (CGRP) or its receptor. Several of these drugs are expected to receive approval  for use in migraine headache in 2018 and 2019.\u2005CGRP-related therapies offer  considerable improvements over existing drugs as they are the first to be  designed specifically to act on the trigeminal pain system, they are more  specific and they seem to have few or no adverse effects. CGRP receptor  antagonists such as ubrogepant are effective for acute relief of migraine  headache, whereas monoclonal antibodies against CGRP (eptinezumab, fremanezumab  and galcanezumab) or the CGRP receptor (erenumab) effectively prevent migraine  attacks. As these drugs come into clinical use, we provide an overview of  knowledge that has led to successful development of these drugs. We describe the  biology of CGRP signalling, summarize key clinical evidence for the role of CGRP  in migraine headache, including the efficacy of CGRP-targeted treatment, and  synthesize what is known about the role of CGRP in the trigeminovascular system.  Finally, we consider how the latest findings provide new insight into the  central role of the trigeminal ganglion in the pathophysiology of migraine.', 'Background: Calcitonin gene-related peptide (CGRP) is pivotal in the  pathophysiology of migraine headaches and represents a promising target for  migraine treatment. The humanized monoclonal antibody galcanezumab (LY2951742)  binds to CGRP and may be effective in migraine prophylaxis. Objectives: The  primary objective was to evaluate the safety and tolerability of single and  multiple doses of galcanezumab in humans. Secondary objectives included  assessing the pharmacokinetics and evaluating target engagement. Methods: A  double-blind, randomized, placebo-controlled study (NCT 01337596) with single  escalating and multiple subcutaneous (SC) doses of galcanezumab was performed in  healthy male volunteers. Single doses of 1, 5, 25, 75, 200, and 600 mg of  galcanezumab (n = 7/dose) or placebo (n = 2/dose) were injected SC in six  consecutive cohorts of nine subjects each. One cohort of nine subjects received  multiple (4) 150 mg doses of galcanezumab or placebo every other week. Target  engagement was evaluated by measuring inhibition of capsaicin-induced increase  in dermal blood flow (DBF). Findings: Sixty-three subjects were randomized and  included in the safety analyses. Galcanezumab was well tolerated in single doses  (1-600 mg SC) and consecutive doses (150 mg SC). There was no dose-dependent  difference in type or frequency of treatment-emergent adverse events, and no  clinically meaningful difference when compared with placebo. Pharmacokinetics  were linear. Galcanezumab induced a robust, dose-dependent, and durable  inhibition of capsaicin-induced increase in DBF, supporting the continued  clinical development of galcanezumab for prophylaxis in migraine patients.', 'BACKGROUND: Episodic cluster headache is a disabling neurologic disorder that is  characterized by daily headache attacks that occur over periods of weeks or  months. Galcanezumab, a humanized monoclonal antibody to calcitonin gene-related  peptide, may be a preventive treatment for cluster headache. METHODS: We enrolled patients who had at least one attack every other day, at  least four total attacks, and no more than eight attacks per day during a  baseline assessment, as well as a history of cluster headache periods lasting at  least 6 weeks, and randomly assigned them to receive galcanezumab (at a dose of  300 mg) or placebo, administered subcutaneously at baseline and at 1 month. The  primary end point was the mean change from baseline in the weekly frequency of  cluster headache attacks across weeks 1 through 3 after receipt of the first  dose. The key secondary end point was the percentage of patients who had a  reduction from baseline of at least 50% in the weekly frequency of cluster  headache attacks at week 3. Safety was also assessed. RESULTS: Recruitment was halted before the trial reached the planned sample size  of 162 because too few volunteers met the eligibility criteria. Of 106 enrolled  patients, 49 were randomly assigned to receive galcanezumab and 57 to receive  placebo. The mean (±SD) number of cluster headache attacks per week in the  baseline period was 17.8±10.1 in the galcanezumab group and 17.3±10.1 in the  placebo group. The mean reduction in the weekly frequency of cluster headache  attacks across weeks 1 through 3 was 8.7 attacks in the galcanezumab group, as  compared with 5.2 in the placebo group (difference, 3.5 attacks per week; 95%  confidence interval, 0.2 to 6.7; P\u2009=\u20090.04). The percentage of patients who had a  reduction of at least 50% in headache frequency at week 3 was 71% in the  galcanezumab group and 53% in the placebo group. There were no substantial  between-group differences in the incidence of adverse events, except that 8% of  the patients in the galcanezumab group had injection-site pain. CONCLUSIONS: Galcanezumab administered subcutaneously at a dose of 300 mg once  monthly reduced the weekly frequency of attacks of episodic cluster headache  across weeks 1 through 3 after the initial injection, as compared with placebo.  (Funded by Eli Lilly; ClinicalTrials.gov number, NCT02397473.).', 'OBJECTIVE: To characterize adult patients with episodic migraine who achieved  100% response to galcanezumab treatment. BACKGROUND: Galcanezumab is a humanized monoclonal antibody that selectively  binds to the calcitonin gene-related peptide (CGRP) and has demonstrated  efficacy in reducing migraine headache days (MHD) in patients with episodic and  chronic migraine. METHODS: A post hoc analysis of the proportion of patients with 100% response  (100% reduction from baseline in monthly MHD) was calculated for each month from  pooled data of 2 double-blind, 6-month galcanezumab studies in patients with  episodic migraine (4 to 14 MHD and ≥2 migraine attacks per month at baseline).  The patients were randomized (1:1:2) to monthly subcutaneous galcanezumab,  120\xa0mg (after 240\xa0mg initial loading dose) or 240\xa0mg, or placebo. A generalized  linear mixed model with effects for baseline MHD, treatment, month, and  treatment-by-month interaction was used to estimate the mean monthly response  rate. RESULTS: The analysis included 1739 patients treated with galcanezumab, 120\xa0mg  (n\xa0=\xa0436) or 240\xa0mg (n\xa0=\xa0428), or placebo (n\xa0=\xa0875). The mean monthly 100%  response rate on an average month in the 6-month double-blind phase was greater  for galcanezumab 120\xa0mg (13.5%) and 240\xa0mg (14.3%) groups vs placebo (5.9%) with  odds ratios of 2.5 (95% confidence interval [CI] 1.9, 3.2) and 2.6 (95% CI 2.0,  3.4), respectively (P\xa0<\xa0.001). The rate of 100% monthly response increased at  each month over the 6-month double-blind phase with higher rates for  galcanezumab dose groups (9 to 21%) than placebo (2 to 10%) (P\xa0<\xa0.02).  Evaluation of 100% response by the number of months showed a greater proportion  of galcanezumab-treated patients in either dose group, compared to placebo, were  able to achieve a 100% response (P\xa0<\xa0.001 up to 3 months); however, though  greater than placebo, few galcanezumab patients had ≥4 months of 100% response  (P\xa0<\xa0.02). The proportions of patients with 100% response were greatest in the  last 3 months of the treatment. Considering the average number days between  nonconsecutive MHD across the 6-month period (not just during the times of 100%  response), the duration of migraine headache-free periods in the galcanezumab  groups was 29 days for those with at least 1 month of 100% response and 55 days  for those with at least 3 months of 100% response. This gap was approximately 6  to 11 times greater than the mean gap of 5 days observed at baseline. CONCLUSIONS: More than a third of the patients with episodic migraine treated  with galcanezumab 120\xa0mg or 240\xa0mg achieved 100% response for at least 1 month.  More patients had 100% monthly response in the last 3 months of the 6-month  double-blind period. For those with 100% response for at least 1 month, the  average time between nonconsecutive MHD for the entire treatment period was  nearly 1 month and approached 2 months for patients with 3 or more months of  100% response.']]]","Yes, galcanezumab is effective for the treatment of migraine.

Which drug can be reversed with idarucizumab?,"[[['PURPOSE: The available clinical data on target-specific oral anticoagulant  (TSOAC) reversal agents that are currently in development or have been approved  by the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) are reviewed. SUMMARY: The development of TSOACs such as dabigatran, rivaroxaban, edoxaban,  and apixaban has presented benefits and new challenges. One of the main  challenges associated with the use of TSOACs is the lack of suitable  agent-specific reversal agents. Several treatment options for the management of  life-threatening bleeding events associated with TSOAC use, such as fresh frozen  plasma, prothrombin complex concentrates, and recombinant coagulation factor  VIIa, have been used, with inconsistent results. Currently, two potential  reversal agents for oral direct factor Xa inhibitors (andexanet alfa and  ciraparantag) are at various stages of clinical development. Idarucizumab, a  reversal agent for the oral direct thrombin inhibitor dabigatran, was approved  by FDA in October 2015. Idarucizumab and andexanet alfa have been reported to  produce anticoagulation reversal effects within minutes of administration.  Ciraparantag was demonstrated to decrease whole blood clotting time to within  10% of baseline values in 10 minutes or less, with a return to baseline  hemostasis in 10-30 minutes. TSOAC reversal agents have been generally well  tolerated in clinical trials. CONCLUSION: Idarucizumab and other TSOAC reversal agents, such as andexanet alfa  and ciraparantag, present the potential for consistent and effective treatment  and management options when life-threatening or uncontrolled TSOAC-associated  bleeding occurs or when emergency surgery is warranted in patients using TSOACs.', 'AIMS: Upadacitinib (ABT-494) is a selective Janus kinase 1 inhibitor being  developed for treatment of auto-immune inflammatory disorders. This work  evaluated effects of high-fat meal, cytochrome P450 (CYP) 3A inhibition, CYP  induction, and organic anion transporting polypeptide (OATP) 1B inhibition on  upadacitinib pharmacokinetics. METHODS: Two Phase 1 evaluations were conducted, each in 12 healthy subjects. In  Study 1, using a randomized, two-sequence crossover design, a 3\xa0mg dose of  upadacitinib (immediate-release capsules) was administered alone under fasting  conditions, after high-fat meal, or on Day 4 of a 6-day regimen of 400\xa0mg  once-daily ketoconazole. In Study 2, a 12\xa0mg upadacitinib dose was administered  alone, with the first, and with the eighth dose of a 9-day regimen of rifampin  600\xa0mg once daily. Upadacitinib plasma concentrations were characterized. RESULTS: Administration of upadacitinib immediate-release capsules after a  high-fat meal decreased upadacitinib Cmax by 23% and had no impact on  upadacitinib AUC relative to the fasting conditions. Ketoconazole (strong CYP3A  inhibitor) increased upadacitinib Cmax and AUC by 70% and 75%, respectively.  Multiple doses of rifampin (broad CYP inducer) decreased upadacitinib Cmax and  AUC by approximately 50% and 60%, respectively. A single dose of rifampin (also  an OATP1B inhibitor) had no effect on upadacitinib AUC. Upadacitinib was well  tolerated when co-administered with ketoconazole, rifampin, or after a high-fat  meal. CONCLUSIONS: Strong CYP3A inhibition and broad CYP induction result in a weak  and moderate effect, respectively, on upadacitinib exposures. OATP1B inhibition  and administration of upadacitinib immediate-release formulation with food does  not impact upadacitinib exposure.', 'BACKGROUND: Specific reversal agents for non-vitamin K antagonist oral  anticoagulants are lacking. Idarucizumab, an antibody fragment, was developed to  reverse the anticoagulant effects of dabigatran. METHODS: We undertook this prospective cohort study to determine the safety of 5  g of intravenous idarucizumab and its capacity to reverse the anticoagulant  effects of dabigatran in patients who had serious bleeding (group A) or required  an urgent procedure (group B). The primary end point was the maximum percentage  reversal of the anticoagulant effect of dabigatran within 4 hours after the  administration of idarucizumab, on the basis of the determination at a central  laboratory of the dilute thrombin time or ecarin clotting time. A key secondary  end point was the restoration of hemostasis. RESULTS: This interim analysis included 90 patients who received idarucizumab  (51 patients in group A and 39 in group B). Among 68 patients with an elevated  dilute thrombin time and 81 with an elevated ecarin clotting time at baseline,  the median maximum percentage reversal was 100% (95% confidence interval, 100 to  100). Idarucizumab normalized the test results in 88 to 98% of the patients, an  effect that was evident within minutes. Concentrations of unbound dabigatran  remained below 20 ng per milliliter at 24 hours in 79% of the patients. Among 35  patients in group A who could be assessed, hemostasis, as determined by local  investigators, was restored at a median of 11.4 hours. Among 36 patients in  group B who underwent a procedure, normal intraoperative hemostasis was reported  in 33, and mildly or moderately abnormal hemostasis was reported in 2 patients  and 1 patient, respectively. One thrombotic event occurred within 72 hours after  idarucizumab administration in a patient in whom anticoagulants had not been  reinitiated. CONCLUSIONS: Idarucizumab completely reversed the anticoagulant effect of  dabigatran within minutes.

The purpose of the present studies was to  investigate the cause of marked decrease in plasma exposure after repeated oral  administration of RG7388 in monkeys and whether the autoinduction observed in  monkeys is relevant to humans. 2.\u2002In monkey liver and intestinal microsomes  collected after repeated oral administration of RG7388 to monkeys, significantly  increased activities of homologue CYP3A8 were observed (ex vivo). Investigation  using a physiologically based pharmacokinetic (PBPK) model suggested that the  loss of exposure was primarily due to induction of metabolism in the gut of  monkeys. 3.\u2002Studies in monkey and human primary hepatocytes showed that CYP3A  induction by RG7388 only occurred in monkey hepatocytes but not in human  hepatocytes, which suggests the observed CYP3A induction is monkey specific.  4.\u2002The human PK data obtained from the first cohorts confirmed the lack of  relevant induction as predicted by the human hepatocytes and the PBPK modelling  based on no induction in humans.', 'Direct oral anticoagulants (DOACs) offer noninferior efficacy and improved  safety compared to vitamin K antagonists (VKAs) for the prevention and treatment  of venous thromboembolism and for the prevention of stroke and systemic embolism  in nonvalvular atrial fibrillation. Unlike VKAs, DOACs do not require routine  laboratory monitoring of anticoagulant effect and dose adjustment. In certain  situations, however, laboratory assessment of anticoagulant effect may be  desirable. Here we review the utility of currently available assays for  assessment of DOAC effect and recommend an optimal assessment strategy for each  drug, including calibrated dilute thrombin time or ecarin-based assays for  dabigatran and calibrated anti-Xa activity assays for the factor Xa inhibitors.  We also discuss reversal strategies, both specific and nonspecific, for each  drug, including the preferential use of idarucizumab for the reversal of  dabigatran and two agents, andexanet and ciraparantag, currently under  development for the reversal of rivaroxaban, apixaban, and edoxaban.', 'The use of direct oral anticoagulants over traditional warfarin has increased in  the United States over the past 10 years because of advantages such as ease of  use, predictable pharmacokinetic response, and safety. In 2015, the U.S. Food  and Drug Administration approved idarucizumab (Praxbind) for the reversal of the  direct thrombin inhibitor dabigatran, but no reversal agent has been available  for oral factor Xa (FXa) inhibitors until recently. Andexanet alfa was approved  in May 2018, under the brand name ANDEXXA, for the reversal of 2 of FXa  inhibitors, apixaban and rivaroxaban, when life-threatening or uncontrolled  bleeding occurs. This accelerated approval was based on change in anti-FXa  activity from baseline that indicated a reversal of the anticoagulant effect.  Any expanded Food and Drug Administration indication will be contingent on  results demonstrating improved hemostasis and efficacy for reversing other FXa  inhibitors.', 'The new oral anticoagulants have many advantages over vitamin K antagonists, but  they are still associated with a troublesome incidence of major bleeding.  Additionally, the absence of a reversal agent for the new oral anticoagulants is  a barrier to their more widespread use. Currently, there are 3 potential  reversal agents in development: idarucizumab is a humanized murine monoclonal  antibody fragment directed specifically at dabigatran; andexanet alfa is a  recombinant modified decoy factor Xa that binds to factor Xa inhibitors; and  PER977 is a small molecule that binds to factor Xa and IIa inhibitors and to  heparin-based anticoagulants through charge interaction. These agents have  undergone phase I clinical testing, appear to be well tolerated in healthy  volunteers, and are effective in neutralizing their respective targets. All 3  are currently undergoing or entering into a phase II or III clinical study. This  article reviews the available data for idarucizumab, andexanet alfa, and PER977.', 'OBJECTIVE: To evaluate the role of idarucizumab, a humanized monoclonal antibody  fragment, as a specific reversal agent for the anticoagulant activity of  dabigatran and to review the pharmacology, pharmacokinetic properties, efficacy,  and safety of this agent. METHODS: A literature search was conducted consisting of a PubMed database using  the MeSH term idarucizumab and the key word dabigatran antidote. Studies  evaluating the pharmacology, pharmacokinetics, safety, and efficacy of  idarucizumab for the reversal of the anticoagulant activity of dabigatran were  included. RESULTS: Idarucizumab represents a novel treatment option as it is the only  humanized, monoclonal antibody fragment that specifically binds to dabigatran.  Studies evaluating reversal of dabigatran-induced anticoagulation have  demonstrated immediate, complete, and sustained effects with idarucizumab.  Idarucizumab did not overcorrect thrombin generation. Additionally, evaluations  have shown that dabigatran can be safely reinitiated 24 hours after the  administration of idarucizumab. The United States Food and Drug Administration  granted priority review for the biologic license application and accelerated  approval for idarucizumab. CONCLUSION: Idarucizumab represents an encouraging development in the reversal  of dabigatran. Its novel mechanism of action, pharmacokinetics, tolerability,  and lack of thrombotic events contribute positively to its use in patients who  experience bleeding or for those who require emergent surgery or procedures.', 'Dabigatran is a direct thrombin inhibitor used to reduce the risk of stroke in  patients with nonvalvular atrial fibrillation. For patients who present with an  acute stroke despite dabigatran therapy, clinical data on the use of intravenous  tissue plasminogen activator (IV-tPA) is limited. There is an anticipated  increased risk of symptomatic intracranial hemorrhage (sICH) when using IV-tPA  in patients on dabigatran therapy. In 2015, the humanized monoclonal antibody  fragment idarucizumab was approved for rapid (minutes) reversal of anticoagulant  effects of dabigatran. Dabigatran reversal with idarucizumab before  administration of IV-tPA might reduce the risk of sICH. We report a case of a  69-year-old stroke patient on dabigatran for paroxysmal atrial fibrillation who  presented with an initial National Institutes of Health Stroke Scale (NIHSS) of  12. There was no early evidence of ischemic stroke or hemorrhage on head  computed tomography, and coagulation studies implied therapeutic dabigatran  levels. After controlling blood pressure, dabigatran was reversed with  idarucizumab, and IV-tPA was administrated beginning 197\u2009minutes after he was  last seen at his baseline. Subsequent brain magnetic resonance imaging showed 2  punctate infarcts in the left temporal lobe and occipital lobe with no evidence  of hemorrhage. The patient was discharged with an NIHSS of 1. Telephone  follow-up 2 months later indicated that he was at his prestroke baseline, except  for a complaint of worsened short-term memory. Idarucizumab reversal of  dabigatran may reduce the risk of sICH and should be considered for acute stroke  patients arriving in the IV-tPA time window.', 'Idarucizumab is a monoclonal antibody fragment specifically targeted to  dabigatran. It has demonstrated prompt and durable reversal of the anticoagulant  effects of dabigatran in animal studies and phase 1 studies of young, elderly,  and renally impaired volunteers. Although elective invasive procedures and most  bleeding complications in dabigatran-treated patients can be managed by  temporarily stopping dabigatran therapy and using supportive measures, there are  rare clinical situations that require urgent reversal of the anticoagulant  effect of dabigatran. The effectiveness and safety of 5 g of intravenous  idarucizumab is being investigated in a prospective, open-label, single-cohort  study in patients with serious bleeding or in those requiring an urgent  procedure. In an interim analysis of the first 90 participants, idarucizumab  rapidly and completely reversed the anticoagulant activity of dabigatran in  88%-98% of participants, and there were no safety concerns, with no deaths or  serious adverse events being attributable to idarucizumab. Supported by these  interim results, idarucizumab has been approved in the United States and the  European Union for use when reversal of the anticoagulant effects of dabigatran  is needed for emergency surgery/urgent procedures or in patients with  life-threatening or uncontrolled bleeding. Clinical use of idarucizumab should  follow the same processes as patient enrollment in this study, which is  projected to be completed in 2016. The outcomes achieved with this specific  reversal agent are likely to be of continued interest to treating physicians.']]]",Idarucizumab can be used to reverse the anticoagulant effects of dabigatran.,"[{'Exact': array([ 0.26793164,  0.91627503,  1.54937424, -0.23880007, -2.89744886,

Proteomic analyses have revealed proteins associated with the triple-negative breast cancers. List some proposed proteins.,"[[['Breast cancer is by far the most common diagnosed form of cancer and the leading  cause of cancer death in women today. Clinically useful biomarkers for early  detection of breast cancer could lead to a significant reduction in mortality.  Here we describe a detailed analysis using gel-based proteomics in combination  with mass spectrometry and immunohistochemistry (IHC) of the tumour interstitial  fluids (TIF) and normal interstitial fluids (NIF) collected from 69 prospective  breast cancer patients. The goal of this study was to identify abundant cancer  up-regulated proteins that are externalised by cells in the tumour  microenvironment of most if not all these lesions. To this end, we applied a  phased biomarker discovery research strategy to the analysis of these samples  rather than comparing all samples among each other, with inherent inter and  intra-sample variability problems. To this end, we chose to use samples derived  from a single tumour/benign tissue pair (patient 46, triple negative tumour),  for which we had well-matched samples in terms of epithelial cell numbers, to  generate the initial dataset. In this first phase we found 110 proteins that  were up-regulated by a factor of 2 or more in the TIF, some of which were  confirmed by IHC. In the second phase, we carried out a systematic computer  assisted analysis of the 2D gels of the remaining 68 TIF samples in order to  identify TIF 46 up-regulated proteins that were deregulated in 90% or more of  all the available TIFs, thus representing common breast cancer markers. This  second phase singled out a set of 26 breast cancer markers, most of which were  also identified by a complementary analysis using LC-MS/MS. The expression of  calreticulin, cellular retinoic acid-binding protein II, chloride intracellular  channel protein 1, EF-1-beta, galectin 1, peroxiredoxin-2, platelet-derived  endothelial cell growth factor, protein disulfide isomerase and ubiquitin  carboxyl-terminal hydrolase 5 were further validated using a tissue microarray  containing 70 malignant breast carcinomas of various grades of atypia. A  significant number of these proteins have already been detected in the  blood/plasma/secretome by others. The next steps, which include biomarker  prioritization based on the hierarchal evaluation of these markers, antibody and  antigen development, assay development, analytical validation, and preliminary  testing in the blood of healthy and breast cancer patients, are discussed.', 'Triple-negative breast cancer is difficult to treat because of the lack of  rationale-based therapies. There are no established markers and targets that can  be used for stratification of patients and targeted therapy. Here we report the  identification of novel molecular features, which appear to augment metastasis  of triple negative breast tumors. We found that triple-negative breast tumors  can be segregated into 2 phenotypes based on their genome-wide protein abundance  profiles. The first is characterized by high expression of Stat1, Mx1, and CD74.  Seven out of 9 tumors from this group had invaded at least 2 lymph nodes while  only 1 out of 10 tumors in group 2 was lymph node positive. In vitro experiments  showed that the interferon-induced increase in Stat1 abundance correlates with  increased migration and invasion in cultured cells. When CD74 was overexpressed,  it increased cell adhesion on matrigel. This effect was accompanied with a  marked increase in the membrane expression of beta-catenin, MUC18, plexins,  integrins, and other proteins involved in cell adhesion and cancer metastasis.  Taken together, our results show that Stat1/CD74 positive triple-negative tumors  are more aggressive and suggest an approach for development of better  diagnostics and more targeted therapies for triple negative breast cancer. This  article is part of a Special Issue entitled: Proteomics: The clinical link.', 'About 5000 (25%) of the ~20400 human protein-coding genes currently lack any  experimental evidence at the protein level. For many others, there is only  little information relative to their abundance, distribution, subcellular  localization, interactions, or cellular functions. The aim of the HUPO Human  Proteome Project (HPP, www.thehpp.org ) is to collect this information for every  human protein. HPP is based on three major pillars: mass spectrometry (MS),  antibody/affinity capture reagents (Ab), and bioinformatics-driven knowledge  base (KB). To meet this objective, the Chromosome-Centric Human Proteome Project  (C-HPP) proposes to build this catalog chromosome-by-chromosome ( www.c-hpp.org  ) by focusing primarily on proteins that currently lack MS evidence or Ab  detection. These are termed ""missing proteins"" by the HPP consortium. The lack  of observation of a protein can be due to various factors including incorrect  and incomplete gene annotation, low or restricted expression, or instability.  neXtProt ( www.nextprot.org ) is a new web-based knowledge platform specific for  human proteins that aims to complement UniProtKB/Swiss-Prot ( www.uniprot.org )  with detailed information obtained from carefully selected high-throughput  experiments on genomic variation, post-translational modifications, as well as  protein expression in tissues and cells. This article describes how neXtProt  contributes to prioritize C-HPP efforts and integrates C-HPP results with other  research efforts to create a complete human proteome catalog.', 'BACKGROUND AND AIMS: We used a proteomics array to simultaneously measure  multiple proteins that have been suggested to be associated with atherosclerosis  and related them to plaque prevalence in carotid arteries in a human  population-based study. METHODS: In the Prospective Study of the Vasculature in Uppsala Seniors (PIVUS;  n = 931, 50% women, all aged 70 years), the number of carotid arteries with  plaques was recorded by ultrasound. Levels of 82 proteins were assessed in  plasma by a proximity extension assay (Proseek Multiplex CVD, Olink Bioscience,  Uppsala, Sweden) and related to carotid measures in a regression framework. RESULTS: Following adjustment for multiple testing with Bonferroni correction,  seven of the proteins were significantly related to the number of carotid  arteries affected by plaques in sex-adjusted models (osteoprotegrin, T-cell  immunoglobulin and mucin domain (TIM)-1, growth/differentiation factor 15  (GDF-15), matrix metalloprotease-12 (MMP-12), renin, tumor necrosis factor  ligand superfamily member 14 (TNFSF14) and growth hormone). Of these, renin  (odds ratio [OR], 1.30; 95% confidence interval [CI], 1.13-1.49 per standard  deviation increase), growth hormone (OR, 1.24; 95% CI, 1.08-1.43),  osteoprotegerin (OR, 1.22; 95% CI, 1.05-1.43) and TNFSF14 (OR, 1.17; 95% CI,  1.01-1.35) were related to plaque prevalence independently of each other and  traditional cardiovascular risk factors. CONCLUSION: A novel targeted proteomics approach using the proximity extension  technique discovered several new associations of candidate proteins with carotid  artery plaque prevalence in a large human sample.', 'The development of metastasis is a complex, multistep process that remains  poorly defined. To identify proteins involved in the colonization phase of the  metastatic process, we compared the proteome of tumors derived from inoculation  of a panel of isogenic human cancer cell lines with different metastatic  capabilities into the mammary fat pad of immunodeficient mice. Using a protein  standard generated by SILAC-labeling, a total of 675 proteins were identified  and 30 were differentially expressed between at least two of the tumors. The  protein standard contained the proteomes of seven cell lines from multiple  histogenic origins and displayed superior features compared to standard  super-SILAC. The expression of some proteins correlated with metastatic  capabilities, such as myosin-9 (nonmuscle myosin II A) and L-lactate  dehydrogenase A, while the expression of elongation factor tu correlated  inversely to metastatic capabilities. The expression of these proteins was  biochemically validated, and expression of myosin-9 in clinical breast cancer  samples was further shown to be altered in primary tumors versus corresponding  lymph node metastasis. Our study demonstrates an improved strategy for  quantitative comparison of an unlimited number of tumor tissues, and provides  novel insights into key proteins associated with the colonization phase of  metastasis formation.', 'PURPOSE: To identify molecular markers of pathologic response to neoadjuvant  paclitaxel/radiation treatment, protein and gene expression profiling were done  on pretreatment biopsies. EXPERIMENTAL DESIGN: Patients with high-risk, operable breast cancer were  treated with three cycles of paclitaxel followed by concurrent  paclitaxel/radiation. Tumor tissue from pretreatment biopsies was obtained from  19 of the 38 patients enrolled in the study. Protein and gene expression  profiling were done on serial sections of the biopsies from patients that  achieved a pathologic complete response (pCR) and compared to those with  residual disease, non-pCR (NR). RESULTS: Proteomic and validation immunohistochemical analyses revealed that  alpha-defensins (DEFA) were overexpressed in tumors from patients with a pCR.  Gene expression analysis revealed that MAP2, a microtubule-associated protein,  had significantly higher levels of expression in patients achieving a pCR.  Elevation of MAP2 in breast cancer cell lines led to increased paclitaxel  sensitivity. Furthermore, expression of genes that are associated with the  basal-like, triple-negative phenotype were enriched in tumors from patients with  a pCR. Analysis of a larger panel of tumors from patients receiving presurgical  taxane-based treatment showed that DEFA and MAP2 expression as well as  histologic features of inflammation were all statistically associated with  response to therapy at the time of surgery. CONCLUSION: We show the utility of molecular profiling of pretreatment biopsies  to discover markers of response. Our results suggest the potential use of immune  signaling molecules such as DEFA as well as MAP2, a microtubule-associated  protein, as tumor markers that associate with response to neoadjuvant  taxane-based therapy.', 'We compared the protein expression pattern of triple-negative breast carcinomas  (HER2-, ER-, PR-) versus those being positive for HER2 and negative for the  hormone receptors (HER2+, ER-, PR-) by 2-D DIGE and mass spectrometry. We  obtained differential expression patterns for several glycolytic enzymes (as for  example MDH2, PGK1, TKT, Aldolase1), cytokeratins (CK7, 8, 9, 14, 17, 19),  further structure proteins (vimentin, fibronectin, L-plastin), for NME1-NME2,  lactoferrin, and members of the Annexin family. Western blot analysis and  immunohistochemistry were conducted to verify the results. The identified marker  proteins may advance a more detailed characterization of triple-negative breast  cancers and may contribute to the development of better treatment strategies.', 'OBJECTIVES: To use proteomics to identify and characterize proteins in maternal  serum from patients at high-risk for fetal trisomy 21, trisomy 18, and trisomy  13 on the basis of ultrasound and maternal serum triple tests. METHODS: We performed a comprehensive proteomic analysis on 23 trisomy cases and  85 normal cases during the early second trimester of pregnancy. Protein  profiling along with conventional sodium dodecyl sulfate polyacrylamide gel  electrophoresis/Tandem mass spectrometry analysis was carried out to  characterize proteins associated with each trisomy condition and later validated  using Western blot. RESULTS: Protein profiling approach using surface enhanced laser  desorption/ionization time-of-flight mass (SELDI-TOF/MS) spectrometry resulted  in the identification of 37 unique hydrophobic proteomic features for three  trisomy conditions. Using sodium dodecyl sulfate polyacrylamide gel  electrophoresis followed by Matrix Assisted Laser Desorption Ionization - Time  of Flight/Time of Flight (MALDI-TOF/TOF) and western blot, glyco proteins such  as alpha-1-antitrypsin, apolipoprotein E, apolipoprotein H, and serum carrier  protein transthyretin were identified as potential maternal serum markers for  fetal trisomy condition. The identified proteins showed differential expression  at the subunit level. CONCLUSIONS: Maternal serum protein profiling using proteomics may allow  non-invasive diagnostic testing for the most common trisomies and may complement  ultrasound-based methods to more accurately determine pregnancies with fetal  aneuploidies.', 'BACKGROUND: Triple-negative breast cancers (TNBC) do not represent a single  disease subgroup and are often aggressive breast cancers with poor prognoses.  Unlike estrogen/progesterone receptor and HER2 (human epidermal growth factor  receptor 2) breast cancers, which are responsive to targeted treatments, there  is no effective targeted therapy for TNBC, although approximately 50% of  patients respond to conventional chemotherapies, including taxanes,  anthracyclines, cyclophosphamide, and platinum salts. CONTENT: Genomic studies have helped clarify some of the possible disease  groupings that make up TNBC. We discuss the findings, including copy  number-transcriptome analysis, whole genome sequencing, and exome sequencing, in  terms of the biological properties and phenotypes that make up the constellation  of TNBC. The relationships between subgroups defined by transcriptome and genome  analysis are discussed. SUMMARY: TNBC is not a uniform molecular or disease entity but a constellation  of variably well-defined biological properties whose relationship to each other  is not understood. There is good support for the existence of a basal expression  subtype, p53 mutated, high-genomic instability subtype of TNBC. This should be  considered a distinct TNBC subtype. Other subtypes with variable degrees of  supporting evidence exist within the nonbasal/p53wt (wild-type p53) TNBC,  including a group of TNBC with PI3K (phosphoinositide 3-kinase) pathway  activation that have better overall prognosis than the basal TNBC. Consistent  molecular phenotyping of TNBC by whole genome sequencing, transcriptomics, and  functional studies with patient-derived tumor xenograft models will be essential  components in clinical and biological studies as means of resolving this  heterogeneity.', 'We have begun an early phase of biomarker discovery in three clinically  important types of breast cancer using a panel of human cell lines: HER2  positive, hormone receptor positive and HER2 negative, and triple negative  (HER2-, ER-, PR-). We identified and characterized the most abundant secreted,  sloughed, or leaked proteins released into serum free media from these breast  cancer cell lines using a combination of protein fractionation methods before  LC-MS/MS mass spectrometry analysis. A total of 249 proteins were detected in  the proximal fluid of 7 breast cancer cell lines. The expression of a selected  group of high abundance and/or breast cancer-specific potential biomarkers  including thromobospondin 1, galectin-3 binding protein, cathepsin D, vimentin,  zinc-α2-glycoprotein, CD44, and EGFR from the breast cancer cell lines and in  their culture media were further validated by Western blot analysis.  Interestingly, mass spectrometry identified a cathepsin D protein  single-nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) by alanine to valine replacement from the  MCF-7 breast cancer cell line. Comparison of each cell line media proteome  displayed unique and consistent biosignatures regardless of the individual group  classifications, demonstrating the potential for stratification of breast  cancer. On the basis of the cell line media proteome, predictive Tree software  was able to categorize each cell line as HER2 positive, HER2 negative, and  hormone receptor positive and triple negative based on only two proteins, muscle  fructose 1,6-bisphosphate aldolase and keratin 19. In addition, the predictive  Tree software clearly identified MCF-7 cell line overexpresing the HER2 receptor  with the SNP cathepsin D biomarker.']]]","Based on the provided context, some proposed proteins associated with triple-negative breast cancers (TNBC) through proteomic analyses include:

What is Jackhammer esophagus?,"[[['The concept of esophageal spastic disorders encompasses spastic achalasia,  distal esophageal spasm, and jackhammer esophagus. These are conceptually  distinct in that spastic achalasia and distal esophageal spasm are characterized  by a loss of neural inhibition, whereas jackhammer esophagus is associated with  hypercontractility. Hypercontractility may also occur as a result of  esophagogastric junction outflow obstruction or inflammation. The diagnosis of  jackhammer esophagus as a primary motility disorder is based on the  characteristic manometric findings after ruling out mechanical obstruction and  eosinophilic esophagitis. Despite the differences in pathophysiology among the  esophageal spastic disorders, their management is similar.', 'BACKGROUND/AIMS: Jackhammer esophagus is an uncommon heterogeneous motility  disorder associated with a distal contractile integral > 8000 mmHg∙sec∙cm. The  spectrum of abnormality ranges from a relatively normal looking contraction to  chaotic repetitive contractions akin to a jackhammer. Although previous studies  have shown an uncertain correlation between peristaltic vigor and symptoms, we  hypothesize that symptoms may be more severe with repetitive contractions as  opposed to an elevated contractile measure. Thus, this study aims to investigate  whether symptom severity is related to the contraction pattern in the patients  with hypercontractile esophagus. METHODS: Patients with hypercontractile esophagus were retrospectively  identified, their demographic and high-resolution manometry characteristics were  collected. Contraction pattern on high-resolution manometry was categorized into  single-peak and multiple-peak. Comparison was performed between patients with  single-peak and multiple-peak. RESULTS: Altogether 35 patients (age range, 45-70 years; female:male, 24:11)  were included. Seven patients presented with single-peak hypercontractile  swallows, while 28 patients presented with multiple-peak hypercontractile  swallows. The patients with multiple-peak showed higher Brief Esophageal  Dysphagia Questionnaire scores compared with patients with single-peak. The  jackhammer swallows with multiple-peak were associated with higher distal  contractile integral values, longer distal latency intervals, and a lower  integrated relaxation pressure. CONCLUSIONS: Repetitive contractions akin to a jackhammer were common amongst  patients with hypercontractile esophagus. Patients with the jackhammer pattern  also presented with more severe symptoms. Further distinction of  hypercontractile esophagus into a jackhammer dominant subtype may be warranted.', 'BACKGROUND: Jackhammer esophagus is a rare esophageal motility disorder that can  result in dysphagia, chest pain, and gastro-esophageal reflux symptoms.  High-resolution manometry is the gold standard for diagnosis, while corkscrew  esophagus on upper gastrointestinal endoscopy is an uncommon manifestation. CASE PRESENTATION: 72-year-old man who presented with progressive dysphagia for  three months without symptoms of chest pain or heartburn. Initial workup showed  a corkscrew esophagus on upper gastrointestinal endoscopy; subsequently,  high-resolution manometry revealed an esophago-gastric junction outflow  obstruction with hypercontractile (jackhammer) esophagus. Treatment with calcium  channel blockers and proton pump inhibitors was successful and relieved his  symptoms near completion. CONCLUSIONS: Even though the corkscrew esophagus is typically for distal  esophageal spasm, the hypercontractile (jackhammer) esophagus can appear. The  high-resolution manometry can help to distinguish each specific motility  disorder.', 'Hypercontractile esophagus (HE), also known as jackhammer esophagus, is an  esophageal motility disorder. Nowadays, high-resolution manometry (HRM) is used  to diagnose the disorder. According to the latest iteration of the Chicago  classification, HE is present when at least 2 out 10 liquid swallow-induced  peristaltic waves have an abnormally high Distal Contractile Integral. In the  era of conventional manometry, a similar condition, referred to as nutcracker  esophagus, was diagnosed when the peristaltic contractions had an abnormally  high mean amplitude. Although the HRM diagnosis of HE is relatively  straight-forward, effective management of the disorder is challenging as the  correlation with symptoms is variable and treatment effects are dubious. In this  mini-review, we discuss the most troublesome uncertainties that still surround  HE, in the light of new data on etiology and epidemiology published in this  issue of Neurogastroenterology and Motility.', 'Gastroesophageal reflux disease (GERD), commonly manifested by heartburn or  regurgitation, is a chronic, progressive condition in which failed sphincter  function allows the contents of the stomach to reflux into the esophagus, the  airways and the mouth. Chronic GERD affects 10% of Western society. The majority  of patients receive adequate relief from proton pump inhibitors, but up to 40%  have incomplete relief of symptoms that cannot be addressed by increasing the  dose of medications. The laparoscopic Nissen fundoplication is the surgical gold  standard; however, the level of technical difficulty and its side effects have  limited its use to less than 1% of the GERD population. These factors have  contributed to the propensity of patients to persist with medical therapy, even  when inadequate to control symptoms and complications of the disease.  Consequently, a significant gap in the treatment continuum for GERD remains  evident in current clinical practice. The LINX(™) Reflux Management System  (Torax Medical) is designed to provide a permanent solution to GERD by  augmenting the physiologic function of the sphincter barrier with a simple and  reproducible laparoscopic procedure that does not alter gastric anatomy and can  be easily reversed if necessary.', 'Corkscrew esophagus (also referred as rosary bead esophagus) is a classic  finding of diffuse esophageal spasm (DES) in barium studies reflecting abnormal  contractions, leading to compartmentalization and curling of the esophagus,  ultimately giving an appearance similar to a corkscrew or rosary beads. We  review the pathophysiology of this finding, correlating it to corkscrew and  rosary images that originated this classic description.', 'Hypercontractile esophagus (nicknamed jackhammer esophagus) is a recently  defined disease within the esophageal motility disorders classification.  Responses to treatments for jackhammer esophagus have been inconsistent in  previous trials, possibly due to its heterogeneous manifestation. Thus, we  reviewed 10 patients diagnosed with jackhammer esophagus and compared their  clinical and manometric features at baseline. Additionally, manometric and  symptomatic responses after treatment with known smooth muscle relaxants,  including anticholinergic drugs (cimetropium bromide and scopolamine  butylbromide) and a phosphodiesterase-5 inhibitor (sildenafil) were compared. We  observed two distinct subgroups in the findings: one with hypercontractility and  normal distal latencies (""classic jackhammer esophagus,"" n=7) and the other with  hypercontractility and short distal latencies (""spastic jackhammer esophagus,""  n=3). The two types also differed in their responses to medications in that  symptoms improved upon treatment with an anticholinergic agent in classic  jackhammer esophagus patients, while spastic jackhammer esophagus was  unresponsive to both the anticholinergic drugs and the phosphodiesterase-5  inhibitor. In conclusion, hypercontractile esophagus may be a heterogeneous  disease with different underlying pathophysiologies. We introduced two novel  terms, ""classic jackhammer esophagus"" and ""spastic jackhammer esophagus,"" to  distinguish the two types.', '""Corkscrew oesophagus"" is characterised on the basis of two case reports and  attention is drawn to thoracic pain of oesophageal origin. Corkscrew oesophagus  is a radiological diagnosis and is characterised by twisted segments in the  distal third of the oesophagus. The condition can sometimes be demonstrated  endoscopically and it is due to a basic disturbance in the motility of the  oesophagus. Painful conditions in the oesophagus are most frequently caused by  gastro-oesophageal reflux or disturbances in motility and the latter is  frequently complicated by reflux oesophagitis. Pain of oesophageal origin is  frequently a diagnosis by exclusion and requires exclusion of ischaemic heart  disease. The initial treatment should be directed to the reflux oesophagitis.  The diagnosis and information about the origin of the pain and the benign course  of the condition will calm the majority of the patients and remove their fear of  a possible fatal heart disease.', 'Jackhammer esophagus (JE) is a hypercontractile disorder, the pathogenesis of  which is incompletely understood. Multiple rapid swallows (MRS) and rapid drink  challenge (RDC) are complementary tests used during high-resolution manometry  (HRM) that evaluate inhibitory and excitatory neuromuscular function and latent  obstruction, respectively. Our aim was to evaluate esophageal pathophysiology  using MRS and RDC in 83 JE patients (28 men; median age: 63 yr; IQR: 54-70 yr).  Twenty-one healthy subjects (11 men; median age: 28 yr; range: 26-30 yr) were  used as a control group. All patients underwent solid-state HRM with ten 5-ml  single swallows (SS) and one to three 10-ml MRS; 34 patients also underwent RDC.  Data are shown as median (interquartile range). Abnormal motor inhibition was  noted during at least one MRS test in 48% of JE patients compared with 29% of  controls ( P = 0.29). Mean distal contractile integral (DCI) after MRS was  significantly lower than after SS [6,028 (3,678-9,267) mmHg·cm·s vs. 7,514  (6,238-9,197) mmHg·cm·s, P = 0.02], as was highest DCI ( P < 0.0001).  Consequently, 66% of JE patients had no contraction reserve. At least one  variable of obstruction during RDC (performed in 34 patients) was outside the  normal range in 25 (74%) of JE patients. Both highest DCI after SS and pressure  gradient across the esophagogastric junction (EGJ) during RDC were higher in  patients with dysphagia versus those without ( P = 0.04 and 0.01, respectively).  Our data suggest altered neural control in JE patients with heterogeneity in  inhibitory function. Furthermore, some patients had latent EGJ obstruction  during RDC, which correlated with the presence of dysphagia. NEW & NOTEWORTHY  Presence of abnormal inhibition was observed during multiple rapid swallows  (MRS) in some but not all patients with jackhammer esophagus (JE). Unlike  healthy subjects, JE patients were more strongly stimulated after single  swallows than after MRS. An obstructive pattern was frequently observed during  rapid drink challenge (RDC) and was related to presence of dysphagia. MRS and  RDC during high-resolution manometry are useful to show individual  pathophysiological patterns in JE and may guide optimal therapeutic strategies.', ""Jackhammer esophagus (JE) is a recently recognized esophageal motility disorder  that is characterized by hypercontractile peristalsis. More than 500 cases have  been reported in the literature. Among patients referred for esophageal motility  disorders, the prevalence of JE ranges from 0.42% to 9%, with most series  describing a prevalence of 2% to 4%. Most cases are women (60.5%). The mean  reported age of patients with JE is 65.2 years, and patients commonly have  dysphagia (62.8%). Reflux symptoms occur in ∼40% of patients, and chest pain  affects more than one-third of patients (36.4%). JE is a heterogenous disorder  that is associated with several conditions, including obesity, opioid use, lung  transplantation, eosinophilic infiltration of the esophagus, neoplasia, and  systemic diseases. The cause and pathogenesis remain unknown, but several  observations suggest that it is the result of multiple conditions that likely  precipitate increased excitation and abnormal inhibition of neuromuscular  function. The natural course of JE also is unknown, but progression to achalasia  has been observed in a few patients. Treatment is challenging, in part because  of the insufficient understanding of the disorder's underlying mechanisms.  Various therapeutic modalities have been used, ranging from observation only to  pharmacologic and endoscopic interventions (eg, botulinum toxin injection) to  peroral endoscopic myotomy. Treatment efficacy remains largely anecdotal and  insufficiently studied.""]]]","Jackhammer esophagus is a rare esophageal motility disorder characterized by hypercontractility, where the esophagus contracts excessively and repetitively, much like a jackhammer. It is diagnosed through high-resolution manometry, which shows at least 2 out of 10 liquid swallow-induced peristaltic waves having an abnormally high Distal Contractile Integral. Symptoms include dysphagia, chest pain, and gastroesophageal reflux. The disorder is often associated with conditions such as obesity, opioid use, lung transplantation, eosinophilic infiltration of the esophagus, neoplasia, and systemic diseases. Its pathogenesis is not fully understood, but it is thought to result from multiple conditions that increase excitation and disrupt normal inhibition of neuromuscular function. Management is challenging due to the variability in symptom correlation and treatment effects.","[{'Exact': array([  4.66524138,   8.02113915,  13.15377935, 119.26569866,

From which tissue was the NCI-H520 cell-line derived?,"[[['Connective tissue growth factor (CTGF) is a secreted protein that belongs to CCN  family. The proteins in this family are implicated in various biological  processes, such as angiogenesis, adhesion, migration, and apoptosis. In this  study, we explored the roles of CTGF in lung tumorigenesis. The expression  levels of CTGF in 58 lung cancer samples were reduced by >2 fold in 57% of the  samples compared with matched normal samples using real-time reverse  transcription-PCR. These results were confirmed by immunohistochemical staining  for CTGF in normal lung epithelia and lung cancer. Cellular proliferation was  inhibited in non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) cell lines NCI-H460, NCI-H520,  NCI-H1299, and SK-MES-1 by CTGF overexpression. Partially purified CTGF  suppressed lung cancer cell growth. The growth inhibition caused by CTGF  overexpression was associated with growth arrest at G(0)-G(1) and prominent  induction of p53 and ADP ribosylation factor. Most interestingly, overexpression  of CTGF suppressed insulin-like growth factor-I-dependent Akt phosphorylation  and epidermal growth factor-dependent extracellular signal-regulated kinase 1/2  phosphorylation. In summary, NSCLC cells expressed decreased levels of CTGF  compared with normal lung cells; this lower expression has an effect on lung  cancer cell proliferation and its cellular response to growth factors. Our data  suggest that CTGF may behave as a secreted tumor suppressor protein in the  normal lung, and its expression is suppressed in many NSCLCs.', 'Juvenile Batten disease is a neurodegenerative disease caused by accelerated  apoptotic death of photoreceptors and neurons attributable to defects in the  CLN3 gene. CLN3 is antiapoptotic when overexpressed in NT2 neuronal precursor  cells. CLN3 negatively modulates endogenous ceramide levels in NT2 cells and  acts upstream of ceramide generation. Because defects in regulation of apoptosis  are involved in the development of cancer, we evaluated the expression of CLN3  on both mRNA and protein levels in a variety of cancer cell lines and solid  colon cancer tissue. We also observed the effect of the blocking of CLN3 protein  expression on cancer cell growth, survival, ceramide production, and apoptosis  by using an adenovirus-bearing antisense CLN3 construct. We show that CLN3 mRNA  and protein are overexpressed in glioblastoma (U-373G and T98g), neuroblastoma  (IMR-32 and SK-N-MC), prostate (Du145, PC-3, and LNCaP), ovarian (SK-OV-3,  SW626, and PA-1), breast (BT-20, BT-549, and BT-474), and colon (SW1116, SW480,  and HCT 116) cancer cell lines but not in pancreatic (CAPAN and As-PC-1) or lung  (A-549 and NCI-H520) cancer cell lines. CLN3 is also up-regulated in mouse  melanoma and breast carcinoma cancer cell lines. We found CLN3 expression is  22-330% higher than in corresponding normal colon control tissue in 8 of 10  solid colon tumors. An adenovirus-expressing antisense CLN3 (Ad-AS-CLN3) blocks  CLN3 protein expression in DU-145, BT-20, SW1116, and T98g cancer cell lines as  seen by Western blot. Blocking of CLN3 expression using Ad-AS-CLN3 inhibits  growth and viability of cancer cells. It also causes elevation in endogenous  ceramide production through de novo ceramide synthesis and results in increased  apoptosis as shown by propidium iodide and JC-1 staining. This suggests that  Ad-AS-CLN3 may be an option for therapy in some cancers. More importantly these  results suggest that CLN3 is a novel molecular target for cancer drug discovery.', 'Humoral hypercalcemia of malignancy, a frequent complication of squamous cell  carcinomas of the lung, is mediated by the parathyroid hormone-related peptide  (PTHrP). This study was undertaken to determine whether 1,25-dihydroxyvitamin  D(3) [1,25(OH)(2)D(3)] and two nonhypercalcemic analogues. EB1089 and  22-oxa-1,25(OH)(2)D(3) (OCT), suppress PTHrP gene expression in a human lung  squamous cancer cell line, NCI H520. All three compounds (1) decreased  steady-state PTHrP mRNA and secreted peptide levels via a transcriptional  mechanism; (2) modulated promoter activity of 1,25(OH)(2)D(3)-responsive DNA  sequences; and (3) activated the vitamin D receptor (VDR) both in vitro and in  vivo. Thus, EB1089 and OCT inhibit PTHrP gene expression in NCI H520 cells and  modulate gene expression through the same mechanism as 1,25(OH)(2)D(3), namely,  activation of the VDR. 1,25(OH)(2)D(3) is hypercalcemic in vivo. However, the  noncalcemic analogues EB1089 and OCT have a therapeutic potential through  suppression of PTHrP gene transcription.', 'Proteomic analysis of formalin-fixed paraffin-embedded (FFPE) tissue would  enable retrospective biomarker investigations of this vast archive of  pathologically characterized clinical samples that exist worldwide. These FFPE  tissues are, however, refractory to proteomic investigations utilizing many  state of the art methodologies largely due to the high level of covalently  cross-linked proteins arising from formalin fixation. A novel tissue  microdissection technique has been developed and combined with a method to  extract soluble peptides directly from FFPE tissue for mass spectral analysis of  prostate cancer (PCa) and benign prostate hyperplasia (BPH). Hundreds of  proteins from PCa and BPH tissue were identified, including several known PCa  markers such as prostate-specific antigen, prostatic acid phosphatase, and  macrophage inhibitory cytokine-1. Quantitative proteomic profiling utilizing  stable isotope labeling confirmed similar expression levels of prostate-specific  antigen and prostatic acid phosphatase in BPH and PCa cells, whereas the  expression of macrophage inhibitory cytokine-1 was found to be greater in PCa as  compared with BPH cells.', ""BACKGROUND: Multidrug resistance (MDR) is a main reason for paclitaxel (TAX)  treatment failure. Indirubin-3'-monoxime (IRO) and Matrine are traditional  Chinese medicines, which may reverse the resistance of tumor cells to some  chemotherapy drugs, but the relationship between paclitaxel resistance and  Matrine is still unclear. The aim of this study was to explore the potential  molecular mechanism of IRO and Matrine in reversal of TAX resistance. METHODS: In this study, MTT assay was used to measure the non-cytotoxic dosage  of IRO and Matrine on NCI-H520/TAX25 cells and determine the reversal extent of  TAX resistance under non-toxic doses. In addition, RT-PCR and Western blotting  were used to evaluate the mRNA expression and the protein level of survivin,  Oct-4, and Sox-2 in NCI-H520/TAX25 cells using semi-quantitative methods. RESULTS: There was no obvious inhibition on sensitive cell strains and  drug-resistant strains, when the final concentration was at lest 4 µmol/L for  IRO and 100 µmol/L for Matrine. So 4 µmol/L of IRO and 100 µmol/L of Matrine  were considered as the reversal dosage. When 4 µmol/L of IRO or 100 µmol/L of  Matrine were used together with TAX, the sensitivity to TAX increased evidently  in NCI-H520/TAX2 cells; the reversal rate of IRO and Matrine was about 1.92  (43.56/22.6 nmol/L) and 1.74 (43.56/25.0 nmol/L), respectively. The mRNA  expression and the protein level of survivin, Oct-4, and Sox-2 in NCI-H520/TAX25  decreased significantly (P < 0.05) after addition of IRO or Matrine in TAX  treatment, compared to that of TAX treatment alone. CONCLUSION: The decrease in both mRNA expression and protein level of survivin,  Oct-4, and Sox-2 might be the molecular mechanism, by which IRO and Matrine  mediate the reversal of TAX resistance."", 'Advances in the understanding of cancer cell biology and response to drug  treatment have benefited from new molecular technologies and methods for  integrating information from multiple sources. The NCI-60, a panel of 60 diverse  human cancer cell lines, has been used by the National Cancer Institute to  screen >100,000 chemical compounds and natural product extracts for anticancer  activity. The NCI-60 has also been profiled for mRNA and protein expression,  mutational status, chromosomal aberrations, and DNA copy number, generating an  unparalleled public resource for integrated chemogenomic studies. Recently,  microRNAs have been shown to target particular sets of mRNAs, thereby preventing  translation or accelerating mRNA turnover. To complement the existing NCI-60  data sets, we have measured expression levels of microRNAs in the NCI-60 and  incorporated the resulting data into the CellMiner program package for  integrative analysis. Cell line groupings based on microRNA expression were  generally consistent with tissue type and with cell line clustering based on  mRNA expression. However, mRNA expression seemed to be somewhat more informative  for discriminating among tissue types than was microRNA expression. In addition,  we found that there does not seem to be a significant correlation between  microRNA expression patterns and those of known target transcripts. Comparison  of microRNA expression patterns and compound potency patterns showed significant  correlations, suggesting that microRNAs may play a role in chemoresistance.  Combined with gene expression and other biological data using multivariate  analysis, microRNA expression profiles may provide a critical link for  understanding mechanisms involved in chemosensitivity and chemoresistance.', 'BACKGROUND: Inactivation of retinoblastoma (RB) tumor suppressor function occurs  frequently in lung cancer. Short-hairpin RNA can be constructed to target  specific sequences and efficiently knock down protein expression. We developed a  short-hairpin RNA approach to specifically target Rb in lung cancer cells to  determine the influence of RB knockdown on proliferation. METHODS: NCI-H520 human lung cancer cells (wild-type Rb) were transfected with  pMSCVpuro-Rb3C, a plasmid containing a short-hairpin sequence targeted to human  Rb. Transfectants harboring the construct were selected with puromycin. Loss of  RB expression in selected cell populations was determined by immunoblotting.  Proliferating cells were counted to establish growth rates.  Retinoblastoma-proficient and RB-deficient tumor growth was monitored in nude  mice. RESULTS: Transfection with pMSCVpuro-Rb3C dramatically diminished RB expression  and led to aberrant expression of RB-regulated genes. Cells harboring  pMSCVpuro-Rb3C grew at an increased rate compared with control cells: 480.6 +/-  37.7 versus 159.4 +/- 36.2 (relative cell count at 12 days). Tumor growth in  nude mice also increased with RB knockdown compared with control mice: 135.2 +/-  73.6 mm3 versus 40.0 +/- 17.0 mm3 (tumor volume at 10 days). CONCLUSIONS: Inhibition of RB expression is efficiently achieved in lung cancer  cells with short-hairpin RNA. Genetic targets of RB are deregulated with RB  knockdown. Retinoblastoma depletion increases growth in vitro and in murine  xenografts. These studies indicate that even in the context of an established  tumor cell line, RB limits tumorigenic proliferation. Additionally, this model  will serve as an ideal system to evaluate the role of RB activity on therapeutic  response.', 'The cylindromatosis (CYLD) gene was originally identified as a tumor suppressor  that is mutated in familial cylindromatosis, an autosomal dominant condition  that confers a predisposition to multiple tumors of the skin appendages. CYLD  has deubiquitinating enzyme activity and inhibits the activation of  transcription factor NF-kappaB. Therefore, loss of CYLD function correlates with  tumorigenesis. Expression of CYLD has been detected in various organs, but its  expression in salivary gland tumor (SGT) is still unknown. Adenoid cystic  carcinoma (ACC) is a well known and typical malignant SGT ACC was previously  known as cylindroma in view of its marked histological resemblance to dermal  cylindroma. In this study, the expressions of CYLD and NF-kappaB mRNA in HSG, a  human SGT cell line, were found to be increased by TNF-alpha stimulation.  Immunohistochemistry clearly demonstrated the expression of CYLD and  NF-kappaB-related factors in ACC tissue.', 'CONTEXT: CD31 (platelet-endothelial cell adhesion molecule-1; PECAM-1), an  adhesion molecule involved in the process of angiogenesis, is used as a marker  of normal and neoplastic vascularization. During the assessment of angiogenesis  and vascular invasion in a thymic carcinoid tumor, we observed unexpected  immunostaining for CD31 in perithymic brown fat nests. OBJECTIVE: To determine whether CD31 is expressed by normal and neoplastic cells  of brown fat, a tissue whose thermogenetic activity depends heavily on high  perfusion. DESIGN: Formalin-fixed, paraffin-embedded archival tissues were immunostained by  the labeled avidin-biotin method using antibodies against CD31 (clones JC70A and  1A10) after retrieval of heat-induced epitopes. Archival tissues included  perithymic, periadrenal, axillary, and neck adipose tissue in which were  embedded nests of brown fat (n = 15), hibernoma (n = 3), lipoma (n = 6),  well-differentiated liposarcoma (n = 4), and myxoid liposarcoma (n = 4). RESULTS: Invariably, multivacuolated and univacuolated adipocytes of normal  brown fat and hibernomas were intensely positive for the CD31 antigen. The  immunostaining ""decorated"" cell membranes and the membranes of intracytoplasmic  vacuoles. No expression of CD31 was found in normal adipocytes of white fat, in  neoplastic cells of lipomas, or in multivacuolated lipoblasts of  well-differentiated and myxoid liposarcomas. CONCLUSIONS: The spectrum of cell types that express CD31 is expanded to include  normal and neoplastic brown fat cells. We speculate that the expression of CD31  may play a role in the development and maintenance of the vascular network  characterizing this specialized adipose tissue. Moreover, CD31 may inhibit the  Bax-mediated apoptosis of brown fat cells. For practical purposes, CD31 may be  used as an immunohistochemical marker for distinguishing between white and brown  fat and for diagnosing hibernoma in paraffin sections.', 'Histone deacetylase (HDAC) inhibitors induce growth arrest and apoptosis in a  variety of human cancer cells. Sodium butyrate (NaB), a short chain fatty acid,  is a HDAC inhibitor and is produced in the colonic lumen as a consequence of  microbial degradation of dietary fibers. In order to dissect out the mechanism  of NaB-induced growth inhibition of cancer cells, we carried out expression  profiling of a human lung carcinoma cell line (H460) treated with NaB using a  cDNA microarray. Of the total 1728 genes analysed, there were 32 genes with a  mean expression value of 2.0-fold and higher and 66 genes with a mean expression  value 3.0-fold and lower in NaB-treated cells. For a few selected genes, we  demonstrate that their expression pattern by semiquantitative reverse  transcription-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) analysis is matching with the  results obtained by microarray analysis. Closer view at the expression profile  of NaB-treated cells revealed the downregulation of a total of 16 genes  associated with cytokine signaling, in particular, interferon gamma (IFNgamma)  pathway. In good correlation, NaB-pretreated cells failed to induce interferon  regulatory factor 1, an INFgamma target gene, efficiently upon IFNgamma  addition. These results suggest that NaB inhibits proinflammatory cytokine  signaling pathway, thus providing proof of mechanism for its anti-inflammatory  activity. We also found that NaB induced three genes, which are known metastatic  suppressors, and downregulated 11 genes, which have been shown to promote  metastasis. Upregulation of metastatic suppressor Kangai 1 (KAI1) by NaB in a  time-dependent manner was confirmed by RT-PCR analysis. The differential  regulation of metastasis-associated genes by NaB provides explanation for the  anti-invasive properties of NaB. Therefore, our study presents new evidence for  pathways regulated by NaB, thus providing evidence for the mechanism behind  anti-inflammatory and antimetastatic activities of NaB.']]]",The NCI-H520 cell-line was derived from a human lung cancer tissue.,"[{'Exact': array([-0.94805241, -1.1779049 , -0.19526764, -0.67701538,  1.53100113,

Is there a role of proton beam therapy in medulloblastoma treatment?,"[[['Pediatric patients who received radiation therapy are at risk of developing side  effects such as radiogenic second cancer. We compared proton and photon  therapies in terms of the predicted risk of second cancers for a 4 year old  medulloblastoma patient receiving craniospinal irradiation (CSI). Two CSI  treatment plans with 23.4 Gy or Gy (RBE) prescribed dose were computed: a  three-field 6 MV photon therapy plan and a four-field proton therapy plan. The  primary doses for both plans were determined using a commercial treatment  planning system. Stray radiation doses for proton therapy were determined from  Monte Carlo simulations, and stray radiation doses for photon therapy were  determined from measured data. Dose-risk models based on the Biological Effects  of Ionization Radiation VII report were used to estimate the risk of second  cancer in eight tissues/organs. Baseline predictions of the relative risk for  each organ were always less for proton CSI than for photon CSI at all attained  ages. The total lifetime attributable risk of the incidence of second cancer  considered after proton CSI was much lower than that after photon CSI, and the  ratio of lifetime risk was 0.18. Uncertainty analysis revealed that the  qualitative findings of this study were insensitive to any plausible changes of  dose-risk models and mean radiation weighting factor for neutrons. Proton  therapy confers lower predicted risk of second cancer than photon therapy for  the pediatric medulloblastoma patient.', 'The aim of this treatment planning comparison study was to explore different  spinal irradiation techniques with respect to the risk of late side-effects,  particularly radiation-induced cancer. The radiotherapy techniques compared were  conventional photon therapy, intensity modulated x-ray therapy (IMXT),  conventional electron therapy, intensity/energy modulated electron therapy  (IMET) and proton therapy (IMPT).CT images for radiotherapy use from five  children, median age 8 and diagnosed with medulloblastoma, were selected for  this study. Target volumes and organs at risk were defined in 3-D. Treatment  plans using conventional photon therapy, IMXT, conventional electron therapy,  IMET and IMPT were set up. The probability of normal tissue complication (NTCP)  and the risk of cancer induction were calculated using models with  parameters-sets taken from published data for the general population; dose data  were taken from dose volume histograms (DVH). Similar dose distributions in the  targets were achieved with all techniques but the absorbed doses in the  organs-at-risk varied significantly between the different techniques. The NTCP  models based on available data predicted very low probabilities for side-effects  in all cases. However, the effective mean doses outside the target volumes, and  thus the predicted risk of cancer induction, varied significantly between the  techniques. The highest lifetime risk of secondary cancers was estimated for  IMXT (30%). The lowest risk was found with IMPT (4%). The risks associated with  conventional photon therapy, electron therapy and IMET were 20%, 21% and 15%,  respectively. This model study shows that spinal irradiation of young children  with photon and electron techniques results in a substantial risk of  radiation-induced secondary cancers. Multiple beam IMXT seems to be associated  with a particularly high risk of secondary cancer induction. To minimise this  risk, IMPT should be the treatment of choice. If proton therapy is not  available, advanced electron therapy may provide a better alternative.', 'PURPOSE: In this study factors are analyzed that may potentially influence the  site of failure in pediatric medulloblastoma. Patient-related, disease-related,  and treatment-related variables are analyzed with a special focus on  radiotherapy time-dose and technical factors. METHODS AND MATERIALS: Eighty-six children and adolescents with a diagnosis of  medulloblastoma were treated in Switzerland during the period 1972-1991.  Postoperative megavoltage radiotherapy was delivered to all patients. Simulation  and portal films of the whole-brain irradiation (WBI) fields were  retrospectively reviewed in 77 patients. The distance from the field margin to  the cribiform plate and to the floor of the temporal fossa was carefully  assessed and correlated with supratentorial failure-free survival. In 19  children the spine was treated with high-energy electron beams, the remainder  with megavoltage photons. Simulation and port films of the posterior fossa  fields were also reviewed in 72 patients. The field size and the field limits  were evaluated and correlated with posterior fossa failure-free survival. RESULTS: In 36 patients (47%) the WBI margins were judged to miss the inferior  portion of the frontal and temporal lobes. Twelve patients failed in the  supratentorial region and 9 of these patients belonged to the group of 36  children in whom the inferior portion of the brain had been underdosed. On  multivariate analysis only field correctness was retained as being significantly  correlated with supratentorial failure-free survival (p = 0.049). Neither the  total dose to the spinal theca nor the treatment technique (electron vs. photon  beams) were significantly correlated with outcome. Posterior fossa failure-free  survival was not influenced by total dose, overall treatment time, field size,  or field margin correctness. Overall survival was not influenced by any of the  radiotherapy-related technical factors. CONCLUSION: A correlation between WBI field correctness and supratentorial  failure-free survival was observed. Treatment protocols should be considered  that limit supratentorial irradiation mainly to subsites at highest risk of  relapse. Optimized conformal therapy or proton beam therapy may help to reach  this goal. Treating the spine with electron beams was not deletereous. A  significant correlation between local control and other technical factors was  not observed, including those relating to posterior fossa treatment. The use of  small conformal tumor bed boost fields may be prefered to the larger posterior  fossa fields usually considered as the standard treatment approach.', ""The number of patients treated by proton beam therapy in Japan since 2000 has  increased; in 2016, 11 proton facilities were available to treat patients.  Notably, proton beam therapy is very useful for pediatric cancer; since the  pediatric radiation dose to normal tissues should be reduced as much as possible  because of the effect of radiation on growth, intellectual development,  endocrine organ function and secondary cancer development. Hepatocellular  carcinoma is common in Asia, and most of the studies of proton beam therapy for  liver cancer have been reported by Japanese investigators. Proton beam therapy  is also a standard treatment for nasal and paranasal lesions and lesions at the  base of the skull, because the radiation dose to critical organs such as the  eyes, optic nerves and central nervous system can be reduced with proton beam  therapy. For prostate cancer, comparative studies that address adverse effects,  safety, patient quality of life and socioeconomic issues should be performed to  determine the appropriate use of proton beam therapy for prostate cancer.  Regarding new proton beam therapy applications, experience with proton beam  therapy combined with chemotherapy is limited, although favorable outcomes have  been recently reported for locally advanced lung cancer, esophageal cancer and  pancreatic cancer. Therefore, 'chemoproton' therapy appears to be a very  attractive field for further clinical investigations. In conclusion, there are  cost issues and considerations regarding national insurance for the use of  proton beam therapy in Japan. Further studies and discussions are needed to  address the use of proton beam therapy for several types of cancers, and for  maintaining the quality of life of patients while retaining a high cure rate."", 'PURPOSE: One of the components of radiotherapy (RT) in medulloblastoma/primitive  neuroectodermal tumors is the prophylactic irradiation of the whole brain (WBI).  With the aim of reducing late neuropsychologic morbidity a CT-scan-based  dosimetric study was undertaken in which treatment was confined mainly or  exclusively to supratentorial sites considered at high risk for disease  recurrence. METHODS AND MATERIALS: A comparative dosimetric study is presented in which a  three field (two laterals and one posterior) proton plan (spot scanning method)  is compared with a two-field conventional WBI 6 MV x-ray plan, to a 6-field  ""hand-made"" 6 MV x-ray plan, and to a computer-optimized 9-field ""inverse"" 15 MV  x-ray plan. For favorable patients, 30 Gy were delivered to the ventricles and  main cisterns, the subfrontal and subtemporal regions, and the posterior fossa.  For the unfavorable patients, 10 Gy WBI preceeded a boost to 30 Gy to the same  treatment volume chosen for favorable patients. The dose distribution was  evaluated with dose-volume histograms to examine the coverage of the targets as  well as the dose to the nontarget brain and optical structures. In addition, the  risks of radiation-related late neuropsychologic effects after WBI were  collected from the literature and used to predict normal tissue complication  probabilities (NTCPs) for an intelligence quotient deficit after treatment with  photon or proton beams. RESULTS: Proton beams succeeded better in reducing the dose to the brain  hemispheres and eye than any of the photon plans. A 25.1% risk of an IQ score  <90 was predicted after 30 Gy WBI. Almost a 10% drop in the predicted risk was  observed when using proton beams in both favorable and unfavorable patients.  However, predicted NTCPs for both optimized photon plans (""hand made"" and  ""inverse"") were only slightly higher (0.3-2.5%) than those of proton beams. An  age-modifying factor was introduced in the predictive NTCP model to assess for  IQ differences in relation with age at irradiation. Children with ages between  age 4 to 8 benefitted most from the dose reduction in this exercise (similar  NTCP predictions for both proton and ""inverse"" plans). CONCLUSION: Modulated proton beams may help to significantly reduce the  irradiation of normal brain while optimally treating the supratentorial subsites  at higher risk for relapse. A decrease in morbidity can be expected from protons  and both optimized proton plans compared to WBI.', 'Embryonal brain tumors are a heterogeneous group of neoplasms that primarily  occur in infants and young children. They are highly cellular tumors with brisk  mitotic activity, and they share a propensity for dissemination throughout the  neuroaxis. Emerging molecular data enable improved diagnostic and prognostic  discrimination for these tumors. Because of their aggressive potential, they are  treated similarly with multimodality therapy including maximal safe resection,  chemotherapy, and age- and risk-adapted radiotherapy. Craniospinal irradiation  is commonly used in the treatment of these patients, especially in those older  than 3 years. Because proton therapy allows for increased sparing of the  anterior structures in craniospinal irradiation, there is a particular interest  in using proton therapy to treat these young patients. For very young patients  treated with focal fields only, proton therapy also decreases unnecessary  radiation exposure to uninvolved intracranial structures. It is hoped that the  use of proton therapy for these vulnerable patients will translate into  decreased long-term neurocognitive, endocrine, vascular, and developmental  effects, in addition to a decreased risk of second malignancies. This review  describes the role of radiation in general and proton therapy in particular for  the treatment of medulloblastoma, central nervous system primitive  neuroectodermal tumors, atypical teratoid/rhabdoid tumors, and the recently  described embryonal tumor with multilayered rosettes.', 'PURPOSE: To calculate treatment plans and compare the dose distributions and  dose-volume histograms (DVHs) for photon three-dimensional conformal radiation  therapy (3D-CRT), electron therapy, intensity-modulated radiation therapy  (IMRT), and standard (nonintensity modulated) proton therapy in three pediatric  disease sites. METHODS AND MATERIALS: The tumor volumes from 8 patients (3 retinoblastomas, 2  medulloblastomas, and 3 pelvic sarcomas) were studied retrospectively to compare  DVHs from proton therapy with 3D-CRT, electron therapy, and IMRT. In  retinoblastoma, several planning techniques were analyzed: A single electron  appositional beam was compared with a single 3D-CRT lateral beam, a 3D-CRT  anterior beam paired with a lateral beam, IMRT, and protons. In medulloblastoma,  three posterior fossa irradiation techniques were analyzed: 3D-CRT, IMRT, and  protons. Craniospinal irradiation (which consisted of composite plans of both  the posterior fossa and craniospinal components) was also evaluated, primarily  comparing spinal irradiation using 3D-CRT electrons, 3D-CRT photons, and  protons. Lastly, in pelvic sarcoma, 3D-CRT, IMRT, and proton plans were  assessed. RESULTS: In retinoblastoma, protons resulted in the best target coverage  combined with the most orbital bone sparing (10% was the mean orbital bone  volume irradiated at > or =5 Gy for protons vs. 25% for 3D-CRT electrons, 69%  for IMRT, 41% for a single 3D lateral beam, 51% for a 3D anterolateral beam with  a lens block, and 65% for a 3D anterolateral beam without a lens block). A  single appositional electron field was the next best technique followed by other  planning approaches. In medulloblastoma, for posterior fossa and craniospinal  irradiation, protons resulted in the least dose to the cochlea (for only  posterior fossa irradiation at > or =20 Gy, 34% was the mean cochlear volume  irradiated for protons, 87% for IMRT, 89% for 3D-CRT) and hypothalamus-pituitary  axis (for only posterior fossa irradiation at > or =10 Gy, 21% was the mean  hypothalamus-pituitary volume irradiated for protons, 81% for IMRT, 91% for  3D-CRT); additional dose reductions to the optic chiasm, eyes, vertebrae,  mandible, thyroid, lung, kidneys, heart, and liver were seen.  Intensity-modulated radiotherapy appeared to be the second best technique for  posterior fossa irradiation. For spinal irradiation 3D-CRT electrons were better  than 3D-CRT photons in sparing dose to the thyroid, heart, lung, kidney, and  liver. With pelvic sarcoma, protons were superior in eliminating any dose to the  ovaries (0% of mean ovarian volume was irradiated at > or =2 Gy with protons)  and to some extent, the pelvic bones and vertebrae. Intensity-modulated  radiotherapy did show more bladder dose reduction than the other techniques in  pelvic sarcoma irradiation. CONCLUSIONS: In the diseases studied, using various techniques of 3D-CRT,  electrons, IMRT, and protons, protons are most optimal in treating  retinoblastomas, medulloblastomas (posterior fossa and craniospinal), and pelvic  sarcomas. Protons delivered superior target dose coverage and sparing of normal  structures. As dose-volume parameters are expected to correlate with acute and  late toxicity, proton therapy should receive serious consideration as the  preferred technique for the treatment of pediatric tumors.', ""BACKGROUND: Proton therapy has been a hotly contested issue in both scientific  publications and lay media. Proponents cite the modality's ability to spare  healthy tissue, but critics claim the benefit gained from its use does not  validate its cost compared with photon therapy. The objective of this study was  to evaluate the cost effectiveness of proton therapy versus photon therapy in  the management of pediatric medulloblastoma. METHODS: A cost-effective analysis was performed from the societal perspective  using a Monte Carlo simulation model. A population of pediatric medulloblastoma  survivors aged 18 years was studied who had received treatment at age 5 years  and who were at risk of developing 10 adverse events, such as growth hormone  deficiency, coronary artery disease, ototoxicity, secondary malignant neoplasm,  and death. Costing data included the cost of investment and the costs of  diagnosis and management of adverse health states from institutional and  Medicare data. Longitudinal outcomes data and recent modeling studies informed  risk parameters for the model. Incremental cost-effectiveness ratios were used  to measure outcomes. RESULTS: Results from the base case demonstrated that proton therapy was  associated with higher quality-adjusted life years and lower costs; therefore,  it dominated photon therapy. In 1-way sensitivity analyses, proton therapy  remained the more attractive strategy, either dominating photon therapy or  having a very low cost per quality-adjust life year gained. Probabilistic  sensitivity analysis illustrated the domination of proton therapy over photon  therapy in 96.4% of simulations. CONCLUSIONS: By using current risk estimates and data on required capital  investments, the current study indicated that proton therapy is a cost-effective  strategy for the management of pediatric patients with medulloblastoma compared  with standard of care photon therapy."", 'BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: Brain tumours are the most frequent solid tumours in  children and the most frequent radiotherapy indications in paediatrics, with  frequent late effects: cognitive, osseous, visual, auditory and hormonal. A  better protection of healthy tissues by improved beam ballistics, with particle  therapy, is expected to decrease significantly late effects without decreasing  local control and survival. This article reviews the scientific literature to  advocate indications of protontherapy and carbon ion therapy for childhood  central nervous system cancer, and estimate the expected therapeutic benefits. MATERIALS AND METHODS: A systematic review was performed on paediatric brain  tumour treatments using Medline (from 1966 to March of 2014). To be included,  clinical trials had to meet the following criteria: age of patients 18 years or  younger, treated with radiation, and report of survival. Studies were also  selected according to the evidence level. A secondary search of cited references  found other studies about cognitive functions, quality of life, the comparison  of photon and proton dosimetry showing potential dose escalation and/or sparing  of organs at risk with protontherapy; and studies on dosimetric and technical  issues related to protontherapy. RESULTS: A total of 7051 primary references published were retrieved, among  which 40 clinical studies and 60 papers about quality of life, dose distribution  and dosimetry were analysed, as well as the ongoing clinical trials. These  papers have been summarized and reported in a specific document made available  to the participants of a final 1-day workshop. Tumours of the meningeal envelop  and bony cranial structures were excluded from the analysis. Protontherapy  allows outstanding ballistics to target the tumour area, while substantially  decreasing radiation dose to the normal tissues. There are many indications of  protontherapy for paediatric brain tumours in curative intent, either for  localized treatment of ependymomas, germ-cell tumours, craniopharyngiomas,  low-grade gliomas; or panventricular irradiation of pure non-secreting  germinoma; or craniospinal irradiation of medulloblastomas and metastatic pure  germinomas. Carbon ion therapy is just emerging and may be studied for highly  aggressive and radioresistant tumours, as an initial treatment for diffuse  brainstem gliomas, and for relapse of high-grade gliomas. CONCLUSION: Both protontherapy and carbon ion therapy are promising for  paediatric brain tumours. The benefit of decreasing late effects without  altering survival has been described for most paediatric brain tumours with  protontherapy and is currently assessed in ongoing clinical trials with  up-to-date proton devices. Unfortunately, in 2015, only a minority of paediatric  patients in France can receive protontherapy due to the lack of equipment.', 'PURPOSE: We report on a radiation treatment technique that has reduced the dose  to critical normal structures in children with medulloblastoma. PATIENTS AND METHODS: Three children between the ages of 3 and 4 with stage M2  or M3 medulloblastoma were treated between 2001 and 2003 with craniospinal  irradiation using protons. Patients received 36 cobalt gray equivalent to the  craniospinal axis, then 18 cobalt gray equivalent to the posterior fossa. The  cranium was treated with opposed lateral fields. The spine was treated with  three matched posteroanterior fields, with the beam stopping just beyond the  thecal sac. The posterior fossa was then treated with alternating  posteroanterior, right posterior oblique, and left posterior oblique fields,  with the beam stopping just proximal to the cochlea. The use of general  anesthesia and pre-porting with diagnostic-quality x-rays allowed precise  patient positioning. RESULTS: Craniospinal irradiation delivered via conformal proton irradiation  substantially reduced the dose to the cochlea and vertebral bodies and virtually  eliminated the exit dose through thorax, abdomen, and pelvis. Despite concurrent  chemotherapy, a clinically significant lymphocyte count reduction was not seen.  Patients tolerated treatment well; acute side effects (e.g., nausea, decreased  appetite, and odynophagia) were mild. All patients completed therapy without  interruption. CONCLUSION: Our proton-beam technique for craniospinal irradiation of pediatric  medulloblastoma has successfully reduced normal-tissue doses and acute  treatment-related sequelae. This technique may be especially advantageous in  children with a history of myelosuppression, who might not other wise tolerate  irradiation.']]]","Yes, there is a role for proton beam therapy in medulloblastoma treatment. Proton therapy has been shown to reduce the dose to critical normal structures, such as the cochlea and vertebral bodies, while sparing the tumor area. It can also eliminate the exit dose to areas like the thorax, abdomen, and pelvis. This can lead to fewer late effects and better outcomes for patients with medulloblastoma.","[{'Exact': array([-6.2619135 , -4.48286351, -2.00880122,  1.51009979,  5.01801289,

Is cystatin C or cystatin 3 used as a biomarker of kidney function?,"[[['AIM: To study an association between clinical and morphological evidence and the  serum and daily urinary levels of cystatin C (CysC) and neutrophil  gelatinase-associated lipocalin (NGAL) in patients with primary  glomerulopathies. SUBJECTS AND METHODS: The investigation included 104 patients; morphological  examination showed minimal change disease in 15 (14.4%) patients, focal  segmental glomerulosclerosis in 24 (23.1%), membrane nephropathy in 32 (30.8%),  and IgA nephropathy (mesangioproliferative glomerulonephritis) in 33 (31.7%).  The investigators analyzed the clinical type of nephropathy, performed  conventional laboratory and instrumental examinations, and determined the level  of CysC (by immunoturbodimetry) and NGAL (by enzyme immunoassay) in the serum  and daily urine taken before kidney biopsy. The degree of glomerulosclerosis,  tubulointerstititial sclerosis, and tubular atrophy was semiquantitatively  estimated. RESULTS: Urinary CysC and NGAL excretion correlated with the degree of  glomerulosclerosis and proteinuria and the reduced glomerular filtration rate  (GFR) regardless of the method of its determination. The urinary level of NGAL  positively correlated with the degree of tubular atrophy. The GFR value  determined from serum CysC and creatinine levels more precisely reflected the  degree of glomerulosclerosis. CONCLUSION: The tubulointerstitial compartment in primary glomerulopathies  should be determined not only by morphological changes, but also by tubular  function parameters by estimating the urinary excretion of biomarkers. The  urinary content of CysC reflects tubular epithelial dysfunction whereas that of  NGAL also characterizes tubular atrophy. To estimate the degree of  glomerulosclerosis, it is more preferable to use the GFR calculated from the  blood concentrations of CysC and creatinine, by keeping in mind clinical  findings (using Chronic Kidney Disease Epidemiology Collaboration formula,  2012).', 'Routinely, kidney dysfunction and decreased glomerular filtration rate (GFR) are  diagnosed by the evaluation of changes in the serum creatinine (SCr) and blood  urea nitrogen (BUN) concentrations. However, neither of these tests is sensitive  or specific enough for the early diagnosis of impaired kidney function because  they are both affected by other renal and nonrenal factors. Furthermore, kidney  injury can be present in the absence of kidney dysfunction. Renal reserve  enables normal GFR even when nephrons are damaged. Renal biomarkers, especially  those present in urine, may be useful for the study of both acute and chronic  nephropathies. The aim of this review is to describe the current status of  urinary biomarkers as diagnostic tools for kidney injury in dogs with particular  focus on acute kidney injury (AKI). The International Renal Interest Society  (IRIS) canine AKI grading system and the implementation of urinary biomarkers in  this system also are discussed. The discovery of novel urinary biomarkers has  emerged from hypotheses about the pathophysiology of kidney injury, but few  proteomic urine screening approaches have been described in dogs. Lack of  standardization of biomarker assays further complicates the comparison of novel  canine urinary biomarker validation results among studies. Future research  should focus on novel biomarkers of renal origin and evaluate promising  biomarkers in different clinical conditions. Validation of selected urinary  biomarkers in the diagnosis of canine kidney diseases must include dogs with  both renal and nonrenal diseases to evaluate their sensitivity, specificity as  well as their negative and positive predictive values.', 'BACKGROUND/AIMS: Several formulas for glomerular filtration rate (GFR)  estimation, based on serum creatinine or cystatin C, have been proposed. We  assessed the impact of some of these equations on estimated GFR (eGFR) and  chronic kidney disease (CKD) prevalence, and on the association with  cardiovascular risk factors, in a general population sample characterized by a  young mean age. METHODS: We studied 1,199 individuals from three Alpine villages enrolled into  the MICROS study. eGFR was obtained with the 4- and 6-parameter MDRD study  equations, the Virga equation, and with the three CKD-EPI formulas for  creatinine, cystatin C, and the combination of creatinine and cystatin C. We  assessed the concordance between quantitative eGFR levels, CKD prevalence, and  in terms of association with total, LDL, and HDL cholesterol. RESULTS: The highest and lowest eGFR levels corresponded to the cystatin C-based  and MDRD-4 equations, respectively. CKD prevalence varied from 1.8% (Virga) to  5.8% (MDRD-4). The CKD-EPI based on creatinine showed the highest agreement with  all other equations. Agreement between methods was higher at lower eGFR levels,  older age, and in the presence of diabetes and hypertension. Creatinine-based  estimates of eGFR were associated with total and low-density lipoprotein but not  high-density lipoprotein cholesterol. The opposite was observed for the cystatin  C-based GFR. CONCLUSION: GFR estimation is strongly affected by the chosen equation.  Differences are more pronounced in healthy and younger individuals. To identify  CKD risk factors, the choice of the equation is of secondary importance to the  choice of the biomarker used in the formula. If eGFR is not calibrated to a gold  standard GFR in the general population, reports about CKD prevalence should be  considered with caution.', 'Whether kidney dysfunction is associated with coronary artery calcium (CAC) in  young and middle-aged adults who have a cystatin C-derived estimated glomerular  filtration rate (eGFRcys) greater than 60 mL/min/1.73 m(2) is unknown. In the  Coronary Artery Risk Development in Young Adults (CARDIA) cohort (recruited in  1985 and 1986 in Birmingham, Alabama; Chicago, Illinois; Minneapolis, Minnesota;  and Oakland, California), we examined 1) the association of eGFRcys at years 10  and 15 and detectable CAC over the subsequent 5 years and 2) the association of  change in eGFRcys and subsequent CAC, comparing those with stable eGFRcys to  those whose eGFRcys increased (>3% annually over 5 years), declined moderately  (3%-5%), or declined rapidly (>5%). Generalized estimating equation Poisson  models were used, with adjustment for age, sex, race, educational level, income,  family history of coronary artery disease, diabetes, body mass index,  low-density lipoprotein cholesterol, high-density lipoprotein cholesterol, and  tobacco use. Among 3,070 participants (mean age 35.6 (standard deviation, 4.1)  years and mean eGFRcys 106.7 (standard deviation, 18.5) mL/min/1.73 m(2)), 529  had detectable CAC. Baseline eGFRcys was not associated with CAC. Moderate  eGFRcys decline was associated with a 33% greater relative risk of subsequent  CAC (95% confidence interval: 5, 68; P = 0.02), whereas rapid decline was  associated with a 51% higher relative risk (95% confidence interval: 10, 208; P  = 0.01) in adjusted models. In conclusion, among young and middle-aged adults  with eGFRcys greater than 60 mL/min/1.73 m(2), annual decline in eGFRcys is an  independent risk factor for subsequent CAC.', 'AIM: To study an association between clinical and morphological evidence and the  serum and daily urinary levels of cystatin C (CysC) and neutrophil  gelatinase-associated lipocalin (NGAL) in patients with primary  glomerulopathies. SUBJECTS AND METHODS: The investigation included 104 patients; morphological  examination showed minimal change disease in 15 (14.4%) patients, focal  segmental glomerulosclerosis in 24 (23.1%), membrane nephropathy in 32 (30.8%),  and IgA nephropathy (mesangioproliferative glomerulonephritis) in 33 (31.7%).  The investigators analyzed the clinical type of nephropathy, performed  conventional laboratory and instrumental examinations, and determined the level  of CysC (by immunoturbodimetry) and NGAL (by enzyme immunoassay) in the serum  and daily urine taken before kidney biopsy. The degree of glomerulosclerosis,  tubulointerstititial sclerosis, and tubular atrophy was semiquantitatively  estimated. RESULTS: Urinary CysC and NGAL excretion correlated with the degree of  glomerulosclerosis and proteinuria and the reduced glomerular filtration rate  (GFR) regardless of the method of its determination. The urinary level of NGAL  positively correlated with the degree of tubular atrophy. The GFR value  determined from serum CysC and creatinine levels more precisely reflected the  degree of glomerulosclerosis. CONCLUSION: The tubulointerstitial compartment in primary glomerulopathies  should be determined not only by morphological changes, but also by tubular  function parameters by estimating the urinary excretion of biomarkers.

To estimate the degree of  glomerulosclerosis, it is more preferable to use the GFR calculated from the  blood concentrations of CysC and creatinine, by keeping in mind clinical  findings (using Chronic Kidney Disease Epidemiology Collaboration formula,  2012).', 'AIM: Chronic kidney disease (CKD) is a known risk factor for cardiovascular  disease (CVD). Cystatin C was recently reported to be an endogenous surrogate of  kidney function, and a high level of cystatin C is reported to be a strong  predictor of CVD; however, the association between cystatin C and  arteriosclerosis in a non-CKD population is unclear. This study aimed to clarify  the association between cystatin C and arteriosclerosis in a non-CKD population. METHODS: Of the 637 Japanese adults (264 men, 373 women) enrolled, we analyzed  446 participants with an estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR) >60 mL/min  and no proteinuria (177 men, 269 women) without a history of CVD. Kidney  function was evaluated according to serum cystatin C levels and eGFR.  Arteriosclerosis was evaluated on the basis of the cardio-ankle vascular index  (CAVI) and carotid intima-media thickness (CIMT). RESULTS: The mean age of our subjects was 67.0±10.0 years. No variables showed  any significant differences according to gender. The results of multiple linear  regression analysis showed a significant correlation between serum cystatin C  and CAVI only in women, but not CIMT. CONCLUSION: We observed a significant correlation between cystatin C and CAVI,  which is a marker of early-stage arteriosclerosis, in women in a non-CKD  population with no proteinuria and eGFR>60 mL/min.', 'AIM: To evaluate the Chronic Kidney Disease Epidemiology Collaboration (CKD-EPI)  four-level race equation in the assessment of glomerular filtration rate (GFR)  in Chinese people with chronic kidney disease (CKD), which was published in  2011, compared with the cystatin C-based GFR estimation equation (CysC GFR) and  the combination of CysC and serum creatinine equation (CysC-Scr GFR). METHODS: The CKD-EPI four-level race equation estimated GFR (CKD-EPI GFR) was  compared with the CysC GFR and CysC-Scr GFR. Three equations were compared with  body surface area (BSA) standardized GFR (sGFR), which was measured by (99m)  Tc-DTPA renal dynamic imaging method in 111 CKD cases. RESULTS: A statistically significant correlation was found between sGFR and  CKD-EPI GFR, CysC GFR and CysC-Scr GFR. Three estimated GFR (eGFR) equations of  30% accuracy were 58.6%, 56.8% and 63.5%, respectively. Average deviations of  eGFR from sGFR were 2.34, 1.19, and 1.32 (mL/min per 1.73 m(2)) (P > 0.05),  respectively. There was no significant deviation in the CKD from stages 1 to 5  in CKD-EPI GFR and CysC-Scr GFR. However, when estimated by CysC GFR, the  deviation was increased, with the value of 12.41 mL/min per 1.73 m(2) (P= 0.002)  in CKD stage 5. CONCLUSION: Our results showed that in a Chinese population with CKD, CKD-EPI  GFR, CysC GFR and CysC-Scr GFR of bias and overall accuracy of 30% were very  similar. There was little advantage in adding Asian coefficient to modifying the  CKD-EPI equation. CysC GFR overestimated GFR in patients with CKD stages 4 and  5.', ""PURPOSE OF REVIEW: The aim is to examine a dominant narrative in nephrology over  the past decade: that measured glomerular filtration rate (GFR) is the gold  standard measure of kidney function; accurate assessment of GFR is critical and  paramount; and further efforts to refine GFR estimation should continue. RECENT FINDINGS: Studies that have simultaneously compared measured GFR and  estimated GFR (using endogenous filtration markers such as creatinine, or newer  ones such as cystatin C or β-trace protein) against some external metric of  kidney function have failed to show that measured GFR is consistently superior,  which is what one would expect if measured GFR were truly the 'gold standard.' SUMMARY: Compared with estimated GFR, measured GFR does not consistently predict  renal-related outcomes better. Clinical decision-making almost never requires  precise and accurate knowledge of a patient's static GFR value. Efforts at  perfecting cross-sectional estimates of GFR may have reached a point of  diminishing returns."", 'A growing number of patients are recognised to have chronic kidney disease  (CKD). However, only a minority will progress to end-stage renal disease  requiring dialysis or transplantation. Currently available diagnostic and  staging tools frequently fail to identify those at higher risk of progression or  death. Furthermore within specific disease entities there are shortcomings in  the prediction of the need for therapeutic interventions or the response to  different forms of therapy. Kidney and urine proteomic biomarkers are considered  as promising diagnostic tools to predict CKD progression early in diabetic  nephropathy, facilitating timely and selective intervention that may reduce the  related health-care expenditures. However, independent groups have not validated  these findings and the technique is not currently available for routine clinical  care. Furthermore, there are gaps in our understanding of predictors of  progression or need for therapy in non-diabetic CKD. Presumably, a combination  of tissue and urine biomarkers will be more informative than individual markers.  This review identifies clinical questions in need of an answer, summarises  current information on proteomic biomarkers and CKD, and describes the European  Kidney and Urine Proteomics initiative that has been launched to carry out a  clinical study aimed at identifying urinary proteomic biomarkers distinguishing  between fast and slow progressors among patients with biopsy-proven primary  glomerulopathies.', 'Novel biomarkers may improve our ability to predict which patients with chronic  kidney disease (CKD) are at higher risk for progressive loss of renal function.  Here, we assessed the performance of urine neutrophil gelatinase-associated  lipocalin (NGAL) for outcome prediction in a diverse cohort of 3386 patients  with CKD in the Chronic Renal Insufficiency Cohort study. In this cohort, the  baseline mean estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR) was 42.4 ml/min per  1.73 m(2), the median 24-h urine protein was 0.2 g/day, and the median urine  NGAL concentration was 17.2 ng/ml. Over an average follow-up of 3.2 years, there  were 689 cases in which the eGFR was decreased by half or incident end-stage  renal disease developed. Even after accounting for eGFR, proteinuria, and other  known CKD progression risk factors, urine NGAL remained a significant  independent risk factor (Cox model hazard ratio 1.70 highest to lowest  quartile). The association between baseline urine NGAL levels and risk of CKD  progression was strongest in the first 2 years of biomarker measurement. Within  this time frame, adding urine NGAL to a model that included eGFR, proteinuria,  and other CKD progression risk factors led to net reclassification improvement  of 24.7%, but the C-statistic remained nearly identical. Thus, while urine NGAL  was an independent risk factor of progression among patients with established  CKD of diverse etiology, it did not substantially improve prediction of outcome  events.']]]",Cystatin C is used as a biomarker of kidney function.,"[{'Exact': array([ 1.00827816, -0.37831887,  0.65062252,  0.48464025,  0.77217931,

Which two interleukins are inhibited by Ustekinumab?,"[[[""Sarcoidosis is characterised by non-caseating granulomas that secrete  pro-inflammatory cytokines, including interleukin (IL)-12, IL-23, and tumour  necrosis factor (TNF)-α. Ustekinumab and golimumab are monoclonal antibodies  that specifically inhibit IL-12/IL-23 and TNF-α, respectively. Patients with  chronic pulmonary sarcoidosis (lung group) and/or skin sarcoidosis (skin group)  received either 180 mg ustekinumab at week 0 followed by 90 mg every 8 weeks,  200 mg golimumab at week 0 followed by 100 mg every 4 weeks, or placebo.  Patients underwent corticosteroid tapering between weeks 16 and 28. The primary  end-point was week 16 change in percentage predicted forced vital capacity (ΔFVC  % pred) in the lung group. Major secondary end-points were: week 28 for ΔFVC %  pred, 6-min walking distance, St George's Respiratory Questionnaire (lung  group), and Skin Physician Global Assessment response (skin group). At week 16,  no significant differences were observed in ΔFVC % pred with ustekinumab (-0.15,  p = 0.13) or golimumab (1.15, p = 0.54) compared with placebo (2.02). At week  28, there were no significant improvements in the major secondary end-points,  although a nonsignificant numerically greater Skin Physician Global Assessment  response was observed following golimumab treatment (53%) when compared with the  placebo (30%). Serious adverse events were similar in all treatment groups.  Although treatment was well tolerated, neither ustekinumab nor golimumab  demonstrated efficacy in pulmonary sarcoidosis. However, trends towards  improvement were observed with golimumab in some dermatological end-points."", 'Monoclonal antibody (mAb) therapy was first established upon the approval of a  mouse antibody for treatment of human acute organ rejection. However, the high  incidence of immune response against the mouse mAb restricted therapeutic  utility. Development of chimeric, ""humanized"" and human mAbs broadened  therapeutic application to immune-mediated diseases requiring long-term  treatment. Indeed, mAb therapeutics targeting soluble cytokines are highly  effective in numerous immune-mediated disorders. A recent example is  ustekinumab, a first-in-class therapeutic human immunoglobulin G1 kappa mAb that  binds to the interleukins (IL)-12 and IL-23, cytokines that modulate lymphocyte  function, including T-helper (Th) 1 and Th17 cell subsets. Ustekinumab was  generated via recombinant human IL-12 immunization of human immunoglobulin  (hu-Ig) transgenic mice. Ustekinumab binds to the p40 subunit common to IL-12  and IL-23 and prevents their interaction with the IL-12 receptor β1 subunit of  the IL-12 and IL-23 receptor complexes. Ustekinumab is approved for treatment of  moderate-to-severe plaque psoriasis and has demonstrated efficacy in Crohn  disease and psoriatic arthritis. The clinical characterization of ustekinumab  continues to clarify our understanding of human immune pathologies and may offer  a novel therapeutic option for certain immune-mediated diseases.', 'BACKGROUND: Ustekinumab, an interleukin-12/23 inhibitor, is effective in the  treatment of psoriasis. A recent Italian study showed more favourable response  to ustekinumab in patients with positive human leucocyte antigen (HLA)-Cw6.  Nonetheless, there are differences in genetic susceptibility to psoriasis  between races, and no studies have specifically assessed the candidate genetic  markers in predicting therapy outcome in Chinese patients with psoriasis treated  with ustekinumab. OBJECTIVES: To determine whether HLA gene polymorphisms can predict the response  to ustekinumab in Chinese patients with psoriasis. METHODS: Sixty-six patients with psoriasis treated with ustekinumab were  included in the study, and the effectiveness of ustekinumab therapy was  evaluated at weeks 0, 16 and 28 by Psoriasis Area and Severity Index (PASI). RESULTS: More HLA-Cw6-positive patients achieved a PASI 75 response at week 4  compared with HLA-Cw6-negative patients (38% vs. 9%, P\xa0=\xa00·019). Similarly, at  week 16, patients carrying the HLA-Cw6 allele showed a higher likelihood of  achieving PASI 50, 75 and 90 than Cw6-negative patients, although this was not  statistically significant. At week 28, a significantly higher percentage of  HLA-Cw6-positive patients maintained PASI 90 response compared with Cw6-negative  patients (63% vs. 26%, P\xa0=\xa00·035). Further analysis of other HLA allele  polymorphisms did not show significant associations with therapeutic response to  ustekinumab. CONCLUSIONS: This pharmacogenetic study provides preliminary data indicating  that positive HLA-Cw6 is associated with a good response to ustekinumab  treatment in Chinese patients with psoriasis.', ""Pyoderma gangrenosum (PG) is an orphan disease. While research on such disorders  is based on only few randomized multicenter as well as retrospective studies,  most of the data comes from case series of small patient groups. Apart from  topical and intralesional therapeutic options for early stages and mild disease  courses, treatment predominantly involves systemic therapeutic agents. Besides  systemic corticosteroids and cyclosporine A (CsA), options also include  intravenous immunoglobulins (IVIG) and biologics such as the TNFα inhibitors  infliximab, adalimumab, and etanercept; the interleukin (IL) 12/23 antibody  ustekinumab; the IL-1 receptor antagonist anakinra; and the IL-1β antibody  canakinumab. The best evidence-based study data is available for CsA,  prednisolone, and infliximab; the latter especially in patients with concomitant  ulcerative colitis or Crohn's disease. A response to IVIG and canakinumab has  been reported in smaller case series. First described by Brocq almost 100 years  ago, it was soon recognized that PG did in fact require treatment. To this day,  however, such treatment remains a clinical challenge. Despite the severe -  albeit rare -clinical picture, improvement in therapeutic options may be  expected in the future, primarily due to further clinical studies - especially  with a greater number of patients, a better understanding of the  etiopathogenesis, as well as the use of modern targeted therapies with higher  efficacy and a lower rate of side effects than conventional immunosuppressants  such as prednisolone and CsA."", 'BACKGROUND: Interleukin-23 is thought to be critical to the pathogenesis of  psoriasis. We compared risankizumab (BI 655066), a humanized IgG1 monoclonal  antibody that inhibits interleukin-23 by specifically targeting the p19 subunit  and thus prevents interleukin-23 signaling, and ustekinumab, an interleukin-12  and interleukin-23 inhibitor, in patients with moderate-to-severe plaque  psoriasis. METHODS: We randomly assigned a total of 166 patients to receive subcutaneous  injections of risankizumab (a single 18-mg dose at week 0 or 90-mg or 180-mg  doses at weeks 0, 4, and 16) or ustekinumab (45 or 90 mg, according to body  weight, at weeks 0, 4, and 16). The primary end point was a 90% or greater  reduction from baseline in the Psoriasis Area and Severity Index (PASI) score at  week 12. RESULTS: At week 12, the percentage of patients with a 90% or greater reduction  in the PASI score was 77% (64 of 83 patients) for risankizumab (90-mg and 180-mg  groups, pooled), as compared with 40% (16 of 40 patients) for ustekinumab  (P<0.001); the percentage of patients with a 100% reduction in the PASI score  was 45% in the pooled 90-mg and 180-mg risankizumab groups, as compared with 18%  in the ustekinumab group. Efficacy was generally maintained up to 20 weeks after  the final dose of 90 or 180 mg of risankizumab. In the 18-mg and 90-mg  risankizumab groups and the ustekinumab group, 5 patients (12%), 6 patients  (15%), and 3 patients (8%), respectively, had serious adverse events, including  two basal-cell carcinomas and one major cardiovascular adverse event; there were  no serious adverse events in the 180-mg risankizumab group. CONCLUSIONS: In this phase 2 trial, selective blockade of interleukin-23 with  risankizumab was associated with clinical responses superior to those associated  with ustekinumab.

Available  data indicate that a strategy targeting the IL-12 p40 subunit has considerable  advantages over targeting of tumour necrosis factor-α, offering rapid onset of  efficacy with a favourable dosing regimen (every 12 weeks for ustekinumab).  Registries incorporating rigorous pharmacovigilance are now required to further  understand the clinical profile of these drugs over long-term use.', 'Ustekinumab, a human immunoglobulin G1 kappa (IgG1k) monoclonal antibody that  binds with high affinity to human interleukin-12 and interleukin-23, has  demonstrated efficacy in patients with psoriasis. The objective of this study  was to perform exposure-response modeling to increase the understanding of  reduction in disease severity following treatment with ustekinumab in patients  with moderate to severe psoriasis who participate in two phase III studies  (PHOENIX 1 and PHOENIX 2). Patients were randomly assigned to receive  ustekinumab 45 mg or 90 mg (n = 1312; 11,624 Psoriasis Area and Severity Index  [PASI] scores) or placebo (n = 665; 3278 PASI scores). Disease severity was  assessed using PASI scores. A population mechanism-based exposure-response model  of ustekinumab using NONMEM was developed using serum ustekinumab concentrations  and PASI scores. The pharmacodynamic response effect was the reduction in PASI  score. The placebo effect, although minor, was also integrated into the model.  None of the covariate factors evaluated (eg, demographics, baseline disease  characteristics, comorbidities) significantly contributed to the between-subject  variability in the pharmacodynamic parameters. The developed exposure-response  model can serve as a basis to support future alternative dosing regimens for  ustekinumab in patients with moderate to severe plaque psoriasis. A robust  exposure-response relationship has been confirmed for ustekinumab in psoriasis.', ""INTRODUCTION: Ustekinumab is a human monoclonal antibody directed against the  shared p40 subunit of interleukins 12 and 23. Ustekinumab is currently approved  for the treatment of psoriatic arthritis (PsA) and moderate to severe plaque  psoriasis, and is being evaluated in Crohn's disease (CD). AREAS COVERED: The first evidence supporting the efficacy of ustekinumab in the  treatment of moderate to severe CD was published in 2008. Results from  subsequent phase II and phase III randomized controlled trials (RCTs) have shown  promising data on the clinical efficacy of induction and remission of moderate  to severe CD. These data and the safety profile of ustekinumab will be reviewed.  Expert commentary: As a significant proportion of individuals with CD have  ongoing symptoms and inflammation despite existing therapies, there is a  clinical need for new agents like ustekinumab directed at different targets on  the inflammatory pathway. Looking forward, more studies are needed to evaluate  dosing escalation or de-escalation in addition to timing of therapy switches. In  addition, further data is required to gauge the comparative effectiveness of  ustekinumab to the biologic agents that are currently used in the treatment of  CD."", ""BACKGROUND: Biologic agents offer a range of new therapeutic options for  patients with psoriasis; however, the relative benefit-risk profiles of such  therapies are not well known. We compared two biologic agents, ustekinumab (an  interleukin-12 and interleukin-23 blocker) and etanercept (an inhibitor of tumor  necrosis factor alpha), for the treatment of psoriasis. METHODS: We randomly assigned 903 patients with moderate-to-severe psoriasis to  receive subcutaneous injections of either 45 or 90 mg of ustekinumab (at weeks 0  and 4) or high-dose etanercept (50 mg twice weekly for 12 weeks). The primary  end point was the proportion of patients with at least 75% improvement in the  psoriasis area-and-severity index (PASI) at week 12; a secondary end point was  the proportion with cleared or minimal disease on the basis of the physician's  global assessment. Assessors were unaware of the treatment assignments. The  efficacy and safety of a crossover from etanercept to ustekinumab were evaluated  after week 12. RESULTS: There was at least 75% improvement in the PASI at week 12 in 67.5% of  patients who received 45 mg of ustekinumab and 73.8% of patients who received 90  mg, as compared with 56.8% of those who received etanercept (P=0.01 and P<0.001,  respectively). Similarly, 65.1% of patients who received 45 mg of ustekinumab  and 70.6% of patients who received 90 mg of ustekinumab had cleared or minimal  disease according to the physician's global assessment, as compared with 49.0%  of those who received etanercept (P<0.001 for both comparisons). Among patients  who did not have a response to etanercept, 48.9% had at least 75% improvement in  the PASI within 12 weeks after crossover to ustekinumab. One or more adverse  events occurred through week 12 in 66.0% of patients who received 45 mg of  ustekinumab and 69.2% of patients who received 90 mg of ustekinumab and in 70.0%  who received etanercept; 1.9%, 1.2%, and 1.2%, respectively, had serious adverse  events. Safety patterns were similar before and after crossover from etanercept  to ustekinumab. CONCLUSIONS: The efficacy of ustekinumab at a dose of 45 or 90 mg was superior  to that of high-dose etanercept over a 12-week period in patients with  psoriasis.

Which are the main causes of fetal echogenic bowel?,"[[['BACKGROUND: An increased frequency of hyperechogenic bowel on ultrasound has  been reported in fetuses with cystic fibrosis (CF) and trisomy-21. However, the  diagnostic application of this observation has been hampered by the absence of a  means of measuring echogenicity. METHODS: We devised an ultrasonic grading system in which echogenicity was  quantified by linear gain reduction and comparison with fetal iliac crest. From  7400 second-trimester ultrasound referrals, 145 patients were identified as  having a fetus with abnormally echogenic bowel. They were offered genetic  counselling, parental and (if appropriate) CF carrier testing, and amniocentesis  for karyotype and CF status if parents were informative. Follow-up was to 4  months of age. FINDINGS: Of 40 fetuses with mild increase in bowel sonodensity (grade 1), none  had CF or aneuploidy. Of 81 patients identified with a moderate increase (grade  2), 2 had trisomy 21 and 2 had CF. And of 24 pregnancies with a pronounced  increase (grade 3), 5 had CF and 6 had trisomy-21. INTERPRETATION: Parental CF carrier testing and amniocentesis to identify  aneuploidy or fetal CF status has a high positive ascertainment rate in fetuses  with echogenic bowel grades 2 and 3.', ""Congenital cytomegalovirus infection with oligohydramnios and echogenic bowel at  14 weeks' gestation."", 'Analysis of CFTR mutation screening in cases of isolated fetal echogenic bowel  in the South Australian population.', 'Fetal echogenic bowel has been reported as a normal variant in the second  trimester, and has also been associated with an adverse fetal outcome, including  cystic fibrosis (CF), an autosomal recessive genetic disease. Previous studies  have reported that 3.3 to 13.3 per cent of fetuses with echogenic bowel  discovered during the second trimester were affected with CF. Between 1994 and  1998 our laboratory tested 159 cases with echogenic bowel detected during a  routine ultrasound examination. The ethnic/racial background of cases included  Caucasian, African-American, Middle Eastern, Hispanic, Ashkenazi Jewish and  Asian. We identified two CF fetuses (1.3 per cent) and eight fetuses with a  single identifiable CF mutation (5 per cent) within this diverse population.  These data indicated that the risk of CF in a fetus with echogenic bowel in this  population was less than the 3.3 to 13.3 per cent prior risk currently used in  most Bayesian calculations. Furthermore, the results suggested that specific  risks for couples should be calculated using data specific for their ethnic or  racial background. Based on our results, we recommend either amniocentesis for  fetal CF studies or CF carrier screening of both parents when fetal echogenic  bowel is detected as a 1.3 per cent risk of CF is considered high enough to  warrant further testing.', 'OBJECTIVE: Fetal echogenic bowel (FEB) is a soft marker found on second  trimester sonography. Our main aim was to determine the outcome of infants who  presented with FEB and secondarily to identify additional sonographic findings  that might have clinical relevance for the prognosis. DESIGN: We reviewed all pregnancies in which the diagnosis FEB was made in our  Fetal Medicine Unit during 2009-2010 (N=121). We divided all cases into five  groups according to additional sonographic findings. Group 1 consisted of cases  of isolated FEB, group 2 of FEB associated with dilated bowels, group 3 of FEB  with one or two other soft markers, group 4 of FEB with major congenital  anomalies or three or more other soft markers, and group 5 consisted of FEB with  isolated intrauterine growth restriction (IUGR). RESULTS: Of 121 cases, five were lost to follow-up. Of the remaining 116 cases,  48 (41.4%) were assigned to group 1, 15 (12.9%) to group 2, 15 (12.9%) to group  3, 27 (23.2%) to group 4, and 11 (9.5%) to group 5. The outcome for group 1 was  uneventful. In group 2 and 3, two anomalies, anorectal malformation and cystic  fibrosis, were detected postnatally (6.7%). In group 4, mortality and morbidity  were high (78% resp. 22%). Group 5 also had high mortality (82%) and major  morbidity (18%). CONCLUSIONS: If FEB occurs in isolation, it is a benign condition carrying a  favourable prognosis. If multiple additional anomalies or early IUGR are  observed, the prognosis tends to be less favourable to extremely poor.', ""OBJECTIVE: The objective was to evaluate the incidence of gastrointestinal  abnormalities amongst those fetuses with antenatally diagnosed echogenic bowel  (EB). MATERIALS AND METHODS: A retrospective review of all cases delivered from April  2002 to March 2003 with antenatally diagnosed EB was conducted. This was defined  as bowel that appeared as echogenic as (if not greater than) the iliac bone on a  real-time image. The postnatal outcomes with regard to gastrointestinal  abnormalities, till their discharge, were noted. RESULTS: Of the 13,941 patients delivered, there were 70 cases with antenatally  diagnosed EB, giving an incidence of 70/13,941 or 0.50%. Of these, 6 defaulted  follow-up and 1 had a mid-trimester termination of pregnancy at 21 weeks'  gestation for social reasons. Of the remaining 63 cases with EB, 2 were  stillbirths at 31 weeks and 35 weeks of gestation, respectively. Three fetuses  (3/63 or 4.76%) were diagnosed with gastrointestinal abnormalities. Meconium  plug syndrome was diagnosed postnatally in 2 cases, of which, 1 resolved with  conservative management while the other required an emergency laparotomy.  Intestinal atresia was diagnosed in the postmortem of one of the stillbirths.  There was evidence of intrauterine growth retardation (IUGR) in both the  stillbirth and the fetus that had required laparotomy. None of the 3 fetuses  exhibited clinical features of aneuploidy. CONCLUSION: As the quoted background risk for gastrointestinal pathology is  0.23%, an increased incidence (4.76%) is observed in those fetuses found to have  antenatal EB. It is possible that the presence of IUGR is associated with a  worse prognosis. Further prospective studies are needed to verify this  association."", 'OBJECTIVE: Our purpose was to determine whether the presence of heme pigments in  amniotic fluid is associated with the ultrasonographic findings of increased  fetal bowel echogenicity in the second trimester. STUDY DESIGN: Spectrophotometric analysis of amniotic fluid for optical density  at 410 nm was prospectively performed to study the presence of heme pigments in  (1) 104 pregnancies undergoing second-trimester amniocentesis for routine  cytogenetic indications and (2) in 14 pregnancies undergoing amniocentesis for  prenatal karyotyping because of fetal strongly echogenic bowel. In the routine  amniocentesis group the fetal small bowel echogenicity was assessed immediately  before amniocentesis and classified as nonechogenic (n = 64), mildly echogenic  (n = 36), or hyperechogenic (n = 4) with the fetal iliac wing and liver used as  references. Only amniotic fluid specimens that were obtained at the first  attempt and that were not blood-stained were included in this study, with the  first milliliter being discarded in all samples. RESULTS: In the routine amniocentesis group abnormal amniotic fluid optical  density readings were significantly more frequent in fetuses with increased  bowel echogenicity compared with those with nonechogenic bowel (8/40 [20%] vs  3/64 [5%], respectively; p < 0.001). In the hyperchogenic bowel group abnormal  amniotic fluid optical density readings were found in four samples (29%).  Overall, 12 of 54 fetuses (22%) with increased bowel echogenicity had a  detectable peak at 410 nm. Three of the 12 (25%) fetuses with echogenic bowel  and positive readings for hemoglobin were chromosomally abnormal. CONCLUSIONS: Fetal small bowel echogenicity is associated with the presence of  heme pigments in amniotic fluid as determined by amniotic fluid optical density  at 410 nm. Swallowing of amniotic fluid after intraamniotic bleeding seems  implicated in the etiology of second-trimester echogenic bowel in both euploid  and aneuploid fetuses.', 'OBJECTIVE: To investigate the association between fetal echogenic bowel (FEB)  during the second trimester and perinatal outcome. METHODS: A retrospective chart review of FEB during the second trimester over 3  years. RESULTS: A total of 56 women were identified of 9067 screened (0.6%) women.  Forty-seven agreed to genetic counseling (84%). Of those, 22 (39%) agreed to an  amniocentesis. There were three cases of trisomy 21, one case of trisomy 18 and  one case of fetal CMV infection. Twelve fetuses had an adverse outcome (21%),  with only three of them having an echogenic bowel as the only finding. CONCLUSIONS: In our study, almost 80% of the fetuses had an uncomplicated  perinatal outcome. FEB was present as the only finding in only 5% of the fetuses  with an adverse outcome. A potential association with placental abnormalities  and a low prevalence of viral infections was observed. These findings may be of  use in counseling parents.', ""Fetal echogenic bowel at 17 weeks' gestational age as the early and only sign of  a very long segment of Hirschsprung disease."", 'OBJECTIVE: Pregnancies medical follow-up and ultrasonography development have  enabled detection of fetal echogenic bowel, a sign associated with various  pathologies, including cystic fibrosis.

STUDY DESIGN: We reviewed the cases of fetal echogenic bowel diagnosed in  pregnant women living in Brittany and referred for CFTR gene analysis over the  1992-2007 period (n = 289). RESULTS: A disorder was diagnosed in 32.2% of the fetuses, cystic fibrosis being  the most commonly identified (7.6%). We also found digestive malformations  (7.0%), chromosomal abnormalities (3.7%), and maternofetal infections (3.7%).  Combining these data with our ongoing newborn screening program since 1989  showed that ultrasonography enabled diagnosis of 10.7% of the cystic fibrosis  cases.

What is the prognostic role of thyroid hormone in patients with heart failure?,"[[['To understand the pathophysiology of thyroid heart disease, it is necessary to  recognize that thyroid hormone has effects on both the peripheral circulation  and the myocardium. One of the earliest responses to thyroid hormone  administration is a decline in systemic vascular resistance and an increase in  cardiac output and cardiac contractility. In many ways, this response is similar  to the cardiovascular response to exercise and is associated with increased left  ventricular work. The majority of cardiac adaptations to changes in thyroid  function are physiologic; however, certain patients do demonstrate clinical  evidence of cardiac disease. Atrial arrhythmias, limitations in exercise  tolerance, and congestive heart failure are reported to occur as a result of  hyperthyroidism and are more common in older patients. Thyroid hormone also  plays an important role in the regulation of blood pressure. Diastolic  hypertension is a common accompaniment of hypothyroidism. By understanding the  mechanisms by which thyroid hormone affects both the peripheral circulation as  well as the myocardium, it is possible to predict the clinical response to the  treatment of various thyroid disease states.', 'Although low levels of free triiodothyronine and high levels of brain  natriuretic peptide have been shown as independent predictors of death in  chronic heart failure patients, few studies have compared their prognostic  values. The aim of this prospective study was to measure free triiodothyronine  and brain natriuretic peptide levels and to compare their prognostic values  among such patients.A total of 334 patients (mean age, 62 ± 13 yr; 218 men) with  ischemic and nonischemic dilated cardiomyopathy were included in the study. The  primary endpoint was a major cardiac event.During the follow-up period, 92  patients (28%) experienced a major cardiac event. Mean free triiodothyronine  levels were lower and median brain natriuretic peptide levels were higher in  patients with major cardiac events than in those without. A significant negative  correlation was found between free triiodothyronine and brain natriuretic  peptide levels. Receiver operating characteristic curve analysis showed that the  predictive cutoff values were < 2.12 pg/mL for free triiodothyronine and > 686  pg/mL for brain natriuretic peptide. Cumulative survival was significantly lower  among patients with free triiodothyronine < 2.12 pg/mL and among patients with  brain natriuretic peptide > 686 pg/mL. In multivariate analysis, the significant  independent predictors of major cardiac events were age, free triiodothyronine,  and brain natriuretic peptide.In the present study, free triiodothyronine and  brain natriuretic peptide had similar prognostic values for predicting long-term  prognosis in chronic heart failure patients. These results also suggested that  combining these biomarkers may provide an important risk indicator for patients  with heart failure.', 'OBJECTIVE: Previous experimental studies have provided evidence showing that  changes in thyroid hormone signaling correspond to alterations in myocardial  function in animal models of heart failure. The present study further explores  whether thyroid hormone alterations are correlated with the functional status of  the myocardium in patients with heart failure. METHODS: In this study, 37 patients with mean ejection fraction (EF%) of 26.2  (8.2) were included. Myocardial performance was assessed by echocardiography and  cardiopulmonary exercise testing. Total tri-iodothyronine (T3), thyroxine, and  TSH levels were measured in plasma. RESULTS: Total T3 was strongly correlated with VO2max (r = 0.78, P = 2 x  10(-8)). Furthermore, multivariate analysis revealed that total T3 was an  independent predictor of VO2max (P = 0.000 005). A weaker but significant  correlation was also found between total T3 and EF% (r = 0.56, P = 0.0004),  systolic (r = 0.43, P = 0.009) and diastolic (r = 0.46, P = 0.004) blood  pressure. CONCLUSIONS: changes in thyroid hormone were closely correlated to myocardial  functional status in patients with heart failure. These data probably indicate a  possible role of thyroid hormone in the pathophysiology of heart failure and  confirm previous experimental reports.', 'In this study the authors sought to determine the prevalence and long-term  prognostic value of low triiodothyronine levels in elderly patients with heart  failure and no thyroid disease. Lower levels of triiodothyronine are more  prevalent in patients with advanced heart failure without thyroid disease, and  this may have prognostic implications. However, this hormonal milieu has not  been investigated in elderly patients. The authors prospectively followed a  consecutive sample of 69 elderly patients aged 76.5+/-5.9 years with heart  failure and 44 age-matched controls without heart failure between March 1997 and  September 2000 at the Geriatric Cardiology Outpatient Clinic of the Heart  Institute of Sao Paulo, Brazil. Events analyzed included death, hospitalization,  and the combined end point of death or hospitalization. The study revealed that  levels of triiodothyronine were lower in heart failure patients than in controls  (89+/-23 vs. 101+/-16 ng/dL, p=0.001). During the follow-up period of 14.3+/-8.1  months there were 19 deaths and 33 hospitalizations in the heart failure group.  The combined end point of death or hospitalization occurred in 38 patients.  Triiodothyronine levels were lower in heart failure patients who had a  cardiovascular event than in event-free patients (82.7+/-24.8 vs. 96.7+/-19.2  ng/dL, p=0.012). The odds ratio for events was 9.8 (95% confidence interval,  2.2-43, p=0.004) for patients in the lowest tertile of triiodothyronine, that  is, lower than 80 ng/dL, compared with patients with levels above 80 ng/dL. The  authors conclude that among elderly patients with heart failure, lower  triiodothyronine concentrations are more prevalent and are associated with a  worse prognosis.', 'Thyroid (dys)function in heart failure: is it a potential target for medical  treatment?', 'In heart failure, cardiac output is insufficient to meet the needs of the body  for oxygen delivery. Available data suggest that alterations in thyroid hormone  metabolism may contribute to defective myocardial performance. Accordingly,  thyroid hormone or a thyroid hormone analogue that improves cardiac performance  might be useful in the treatment of heart failure and has been studied.  Experimental and theoretical results of these studies are reviewed and indicate  that thyroid hormone increases cardiac output by a combination of effects on the  heart and peripheral circulation, specifically by increasing myocardial  contractile performance and decreasing venous compliance. In the rat  postinfarction model of heart failure, treatment with low doses of thyroxine  (1.5 micrograms/100 g) for 3 days produced a positive inotropic response,  including an increase in rate of change of left ventricular pressure and a  decrease in left ventricular end-diastolic pressure. These changes could be  attributed to conversion to triiodothyronine, the active intracellular form of  thyroid hormone. When treatment with thyroxine was continued at the same or  higher doses (3 to 15 micrograms/100 g) for 10 to 12 days, heart rate increased  and improvement in left ventricular end-diastolic pressure was not sustained.  More favorable results were obtained with 3,5-diiodothyropropionic acid, a  cardiotonic thyroid hormone analogue administered at doses of 375 microgram/100  g, given in combination with captopril. Thus, triiodothyronine or a thyroid  hormone analogue may be a useful adjunct to other measures in the treatment of  heart failure.', 'Effects of thyroid gland hormones on cardiovascular system have been known for  many years. Thyroid gland hormones deficiency is connected with a range of  metabolic and hemodynamic changes which can contribute to a genesis of heart  failure. Recent works refer to an importance of connection of thyroid gland  hormones metabolism with heart insufficiency pathophysiology. That is especially  a syndrome of a low trijodthyronin level marked as euthyroid sick syndrome which  is significantly more frequent in patients with chronic heart failure compared  to a population of healthy individuals. Recent clinical works proved that  treatment administration of thyroid gland hormones to patients with heart  failure is connected with favourable hemodynamic changes and increased working  capacity if the treatment is well tolerated.', 'BACKGROUND: Clinical and experimental data have suggested a potential negative  impact of low-T3 state on the prognosis of cardiac diseases. The aim of the  present prospective study was to assess the role of thyroid hormones in the  prognosis of patient population with heart disease. METHODS AND RESULTS: A total of 573 consecutive cardiac patients underwent  thyroid function profile evaluation. They were divided in two subgroups: group  I, 173 patients with low T3, ie, with free T3 (fT3) <3.1 pmol/L, and group II,  400 patients with normal fT3 (>or=3.1 pmol/L). We considered cumulative and  cardiac death events. During the 1-year follow-up, there were 25 cumulative  deaths in group I and 12 in group II (14.4% versus 3%, P<0.0001); cardiac deaths  were 13 in group I and 6 in group II (7.5% versus 1.5%, P=0.0006). According to  the Cox model, fT3 was the most important predictor of cumulative death (hazard  ratio [HR] 3.582, P<0.0001), followed by dyslipidemia (HR 2.955, P=0.023), age  (HR 1.051, P<0.005), and left ventricular ejection fraction (HR 1.037, P=0.006).  At the logistic multivariate analysis, fT3 was the highest independent predictor  of death (HR 0.395, P=0.003). A prevalence of low fT3 levels was found in  patients with NYHA class III-IV illness compared with patients with NYHA class  I-II (chi(2) 5.65, P=0.019). CONCLUSIONS: Low-T3 syndrome is a strong predictor of death in cardiac patients  and might be directly implicated in the poor prognosis of cardiac patients.', 'Thyroid hormone has multiple effects on the cardiovascular system, ranging from  molecular and cellular effects to the consequent hemodynamic alterations.  Consequently, thyroid function has been evaluated in small cohorts of patients  with advanced heart failure that indicate a significant prevalence of  morphologic or functional thyroid disorders. We sought to determine the  prevalence of altered thyroid hormone metabolism in a broad spectrum of  ambulatory heart failure patients. Thyroid function tests were evaluated in 132  ambulatory patients (98 males, 32 females, mean age, 67 years) with left  ventricular systolic dysfunction (EF < 35%) and New York Heart Association  (NYHA) class I-IV symptoms. Hypothyroidism was defined as serum  thyroid-stimulating hormone (TSH) > 4.25 U/mL and low triiodothyronine (T3)  state was defined as T3 levels < 80 ng/dL, with normal thyroxine (T4) and TSH  level. Seven percent of patients were found to have primary hypothyroidism and  34% have a low T3 state. Of patients receiving amiodarone, 21% had elevated TSH  levels and 76% had low T3 levels. The prevalence of abnormal thyroid function  correlated with NYHA class. There is an unexpectedly high risk of hypothyroidism  and low T3 syndrome in patients regardless of treatment with amiodarone, which  appears to correlate with disease severity that requires further investigation.', 'BACKGROUND: It has been suggested that low thyroid hormones levels may be  associated with increased mortality in patients with cardiovascular disease. AIM: To evaluate the prognostic role of thyroid function deficiency in patients  with chronic heart failure (CHF). METHODS: We evaluated 338 consecutive outpatients with stable CHF receiving  conventional therapy, all of whom underwent a physical examination,  electrocardiography and echocardiography. Blood samples were drawn to assess  renal function, and Na+, hemoglobin, NT-proBNPs, fT3, fT4 and TSH levels.  Patients with hyperthyroidism were excluded. RESULTS: During the follow-up (15+/-8 months), heart failure progression was  observed in 79 patients (including 18 who died of heart failure after  hospitalisation and six who underwent transplantation). Univariate regression  analysis showed that TSH (p<0.0001), fT3 (p<0.0001), fT4 (p=0.016) and fT3/fT4  (p<0.0001) were associated with heart failure progression but multivariate  analysis showed that only TSH considered as a continuous variable (p = 0.001) as  well as subclinical hypothyroidism (TSH &gt 5.5 mUI/l; p=0.014) remained  significantly associated with the events. CONCLUSIONS: In CHF patients TSH levels even slightly above normal range are  independently associated with a greater likelihood of heart failure progression.  This supports the need for prospective studies aimed at clarifying the most  appropriate therapeutic approach to sub-clinical hypothyroidism in such  patients.']]]","The prognostic role of thyroid hormone in patients with heart failure is complex and multifaceted. Studies have shown that low levels of free triiodothyronine (T3) are more prevalent in patients with advanced heart failure and are associated with a worse prognosis. For instance, a study found that lower T3 levels were more common in heart failure patients and were linked to a higher risk of death. On the other hand, some studies suggest that thyroid hormone treatment can improve hemodynamic changes and increase working capacity in patients with heart failure, indicating a potential beneficial effect. However, the relationship between thyroid hormone levels and outcomes in heart failure patients is not straightforward, and the optimal management strategy remains under investigation.","[{'Exact': array([ 3.75202182,  7.05695105, -4.19924708, 35.20712314, -2.22099635,

Which molecule is inhibited by encorafenib?,"[[['RAF kinase is crucially involved in cell proliferation and survival in  colorectal cancer (CRC). Patients with metastatic CRC (mCRC) harboring BRAF  mutations (BRAFms) not only experience a poor prognosis but also benefit less  from therapeutics targeting ERK signaling. With advances in RAF inhibitors and  second-generation inhibitors including encorafenib and vemurafenib, which have  been approved for treating BRAF-V600E malignancies, the combinatorial  therapeutic strategies of RAF inhibitors elicit remarkable responses in patients  with BRAF-V600E mCRC. However, the therapeutic efficacy is restricted by  resistance, which might be due to RAF dimerization and reactivation of the MAPK  pathway. In addition, the next-generation RAF inhibitors, which are  characterized by varying structural and biochemical properties, have achieved  preclinical and clinical advances. Herein, we summarize the existing mechanism  of RAF kinases in CRC, including MAPK feedback reactivation of resistance to RAF  inhibitors. We additionally summarize the development of three generations of  RAF inhibitors and different therapeutic strategies including the combination of  EGFR, BRAF, and PI3K inhibitors for BRAFm CRC treatment.', 'PURPOSE: To test second-line personalized medicine combination therapies, based  on genomic and proteomic data, in patient-derived xenograft (PDX) models. EXPERIMENTAL DESIGN: We established 12 PDXs from BRAF inhibitor-progressed  melanoma patients. Following expansion, PDXs were analyzed using targeted  sequencing and reverse-phase protein arrays. By using multi-arm preclinical  trial designs, we identified efficacious precision medicine approaches. RESULTS: We identified alterations previously described as drivers of  resistance: NRAS mutations in 3 PDXs, MAP2K1 (MEK1) mutations in 2, BRAF  amplification in 4, and aberrant PTEN in 7. At the protein level, re-activation  of phospho-MAPK predominated, with parallel activation of PI3K in a subset.  Second-line efficacy of the pan-PI3K inhibitor BKM120 with either BRAF  (encorafenib)/MEK (binimetinib) inhibitor combination or the ERK inhibitor  VX-11e was confirmed in vivo Amplification of MET was observed in 3 PDX models,  a higher frequency than expected and a possible novel mechanism of resistance.  Importantly, MET amplification alone did not predict sensitivity to the MET  inhibitor capmatinib. In contrast, capmatinib as single agent resulted in  significant but transient tumor regression in a PDX with resistance to BRAF/MEK  combination therapy and high pMET. The triple combination  capmatinib/encorafenib/binimetinib resulted in complete and sustained tumor  regression in all animals. CONCLUSIONS: Genomic and proteomic data integration identifies dual-core pathway  inhibition as well as MET as combinatorial targets. These studies provide  evidence for biomarker development to appropriately select personalized  therapies of patients and avoid treatment failures. See related commentary by  Hartsough and Aplin, p. 1550.', 'BACKGROUND: Chronic myelogenous leukemia (CML) and Philadelphia  chromosome-positive (Ph+) acute lymphatic leukemia (Ph + ALL) are caused by the  t(9;22), which fuses BCR to ABL resulting in deregulated ABL-tyrosine kinase  activity. The constitutively activated BCR/ABL-kinase ""escapes"" the  auto-inhibition mechanisms of c-ABL, such as allosteric inhibition. The  ABL-kinase inhibitors (AKIs) Imatinib, Nilotinib or Dasatinib, which target the  ATP-binding site, are effective in Ph + leukemia. Another molecular therapy  approach targeting BCR/ABL restores allosteric inhibition. Given the fact that  all AKIs fail to inhibit BCR/ABL harboring the \'gatekeeper\' mutation T315I, we  investigated the effects of AKIs in combination with the allosteric inhibitor  GNF2 in Ph + leukemia. METHODS: The efficacy of this approach on the leukemogenic potential of BCR/ABL  was studied in Ba/F3 cells, primary murine bone marrow cells, and untransformed  Rat-1 fibroblasts expressing BCR/ABL or BCR/ABL-T315I as well as in  patient-derived long-term cultures (PDLTC) from Ph + ALL-patients. RESULTS: Here, we show that GNF-2 increased the effects of AKIs on unmutated  BCR/ABL. Interestingly, the combination of Dasatinib and GNF-2 overcame  resistance of BCR/ABL-T315I in all models used in a synergistic manner. CONCLUSIONS: Our observations establish a new approach for the molecular  targeting of BCR/ABL and its resistant mutants using a combination of AKIs and  allosteric inhibitors.', ""Topoisomerase I inhibitors down-regulate HIF-1α leading to tumor growth  inhibition, but only while maintaining sustained levels of drug exposure.  EZN-2208, a multi-arm 40 kDa pegylated, releasable SN38-drug conjugate, provides  higher, longer lasting exposure of tumors to SN38 in contrast to SN38 that is  released from CPT-11. EZN-2208 also consistently has greater antitumor activity  than CPT-11 in a variety of solid and hematological tumor models. In this  report, the ability of PEG-SN38 to down-regulate HIF-1α and its downstream  targets, in a more potent, sustained manner compared with CPT-11 was examined.  To do so, U251 glioma xenografts that stably expressed a hypoxia response  element-dependent luciferase reporter gene were implanted in mice. After  treatment it was found that EZN-2208 induced potent, sustained HIF-1α  down-regulation (37% at 48 h and 83% at 120 h) in the tumors, whereas CPT-11  caused only minor, transient HIF-1α down-regulation. In addition, EZN-2208  down-regulated mRNA levels of HIF-1α targeted genes (MMP2, VEGF1, Glut1, Glut3  and TGFβ1). Further, western blot analyses of xenograft tumors demonstrated that  EZN-2208 had significantly more effect than CPT-11 in down-regulating HIF-1α,  VEGF, Glut1 and MMP2 protein levels. Significant down-regulation of HIF-1α and  VEGF proteins translated to EZN-2208's superior anti-angiogenic activity  compared with CPT-11, confirmed by microvessel density reduction in a  chorioallantoic membrane assay and in CD-31 immunohistochemistry studies.  Additional studies done with matrigel implants devoid of tumor cells show that  EZN-2208 significantly inhibits angiogenesis while CPT-11 has little or no  effect. It is concluded that the superior antitumor activity of EZN-2208  compared with CPT-11 is attributed, in part, to an anti-angiogenic effect.  Ongoing clinical Phase I and Phase II studies will assess safety and efficacy of  EZN-2208."", 'Cutaneous toxicities under therapy with selective BRAF inhibitors such as  vemurafenib or encorafenib (LGX818) are frequent, including plantar  hyperkeratosis, squamous cell carcinoma, and second primary melanoma. Pyogenic  granuloma is a benign, rapidly growing, eruptive hemangioma that often bleeds  and ulcerates. Common causes are mechanical trauma and cast immobilization, as  well as multiple drugs such as retinoids and antineoplastic agents. However, the  development of pyogenic granuloma under treatment with encorafenib (LGX818) has  not yet been reported. These three cases might be further examples for  paradoxical activation of the mitogen-activated protein kinase pathway. We  report three male patients with metastatic BRAFV600E-mutated melanoma who  developed pyogenic granulomas 16, 10, and 12 weeks after treatment initiation  with the selective BRAF inhibitors vemurafenib or encorafenib (LGX818). Except  for one patient receiving retinoids, the clinical history for other frequent  causes of pyogenic granuloma was negative. Pyogenic granulomas are not listed in  the drugs investigator brochure but seem to be associated with selective BRAF  inhibitors and might be a cutaneous phenomenon of paradoxical mitogen-activated  protein kinase pathway activation. This correlation has to be confirmed by  further observations.', 'The inhibitory activity of a broad group of known metalloenzyme inhibitors  against a panel of metalloenzymes was evaluated. Clinically approved inhibitors  were selected as well as several other reported metalloprotein inhibitors in  order to represent a broad range of metal binding groups (MBGs), including  hydroxamic acid, carboxylate, hydroxypyridinonate, thiol, and N-hydroxyurea  functional groups. A panel of metalloenzymes, including carbonic anhydrase  (hCAII), several matrix metalloproteinases (MMPs), angiotensin converting enzyme  (ACE), histone deacetylase (HDAC-2), and tyrosinase (TY), was selected based on  their clinical importance for a range of pathologies. In addition, each  inhibitor was evaluated for its ability to remove Fe(3+) from holo-transferrin  to gauge the ability of the inhibitors to access Fe(3+) from a primary transport  protein. The results show that the metalloenzyme inhibitors are quite selective  for their intended targets, suggesting that despite their ability to bind metal  ions, metalloprotein inhibitors are not prone to widespread off-target enzyme  inhibition activity.', 'BACKGROUND: Combined BRAF-MEK inhibitor therapy is the standard of care for  BRAFV600-mutant advanced melanoma. We investigated encorafenib, a BRAF inhibitor  with unique target-binding properties, alone or in combination with the MEK  inhibitor binimetinib, versus vemurafenib in patients with advanced  BRAFV600-mutant melanoma. METHODS: COLUMBUS was conducted as a two-part, randomised, open-label phase 3  study at 162 hospitals in 28 countries. Eligible patients were aged 18 years or  older and had histologically confirmed locally advanced (American Joint  Committee on Cancer [AJCC] stage IIIB, IIIC, or IV), unresectable or metastatic  cutaneous melanoma, or unknown primary melanoma; a BRAFV600E or BRAFV600K  mutation; an Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group (ECOG) performance status of 0  or 1; and were treatment naive or had progressed on or after previous first-line  immunotherapy. In part 1 of the study, patients were randomly assigned (1:1:1)  via interactive response technology to receive either oral encorafenib 450 mg  once daily plus oral binimetinib 45 mg twice daily (encorafenib plus binimetinib  group), oral encorafenib 300 mg once daily (encorafenib group), or oral  vemurafenib 960 mg twice daily (vemurafenib group). The primary endpoint was  progression-free survival by blinded independent central review for encorafenib  plus binimetinib versus vemurafenib. Efficacy analyses were by  intention-to-treat. Safety was analysed in patients who received at least one  dose of study drug and one postbaseline safety assessment. The results of part 2  will be published separately. This study is registered with ClinicalTrials.gov,  number NCT01909453, and EudraCT, number 2013-001176-38. FINDINGS: Between Dec 30, 2013, and April 10, 2015, 577 of 1345 screened  patients were randomly assigned to either the encorafenib plus binimetinib group  (n=192), the encorafenib group (n=194), or the vemurafenib group (n=191). With a  median follow-up of 16·6 months (95% CI 14·8-16·9), median progression-free  survival was 14·9 months (95% CI 11·0-18·5) in the encorafenib plus binimetinib  group and 7·3 months (5·6-8·2) in the vemurafenib group (hazard ratio [HR] 0·54,  95% CI 0·41-0·71; two-sided p<0·0001). The most common grade 3-4 adverse events  seen in more than 5% of patients in the encorafenib plus binimetinib group were  increased γ-glutamyltransferase (18 [9%] of 192 patients), increased creatine  phosphokinase (13 [7%]), and hypertension (11 [6%]); in the encorafenib group  they were palmoplantar erythrodysaesthesia syndrome (26 [14%] of 192 patients),  myalgia (19 [10%]), and arthralgia (18 [9%]); and in the vemurafenib group it  was arthralgia (11 [6%] of 186 patients). There were no treatment-related deaths  except for one death in the combination group, which was considered possibly  related to treatment by the investigator. INTERPRETATION: Encorafenib plus binimetinib and encorafenib monotherapy showed  favourable efficacy compared with vemurafenib. Overall, encorafenib plus  binimetinib appears to have an improved tolerability profile compared with  encorafenib or vemurafenib. Encorafenib plus binimetinib could represent a new  treatment option for patients with BRAF-mutant melanoma. FUNDING: Array BioPharma, Novartis.', 'PURPOSE: Dual MAPK pathway inhibition (dMAPKi) with BRAF and MEK inhibitors  improves survival in BRAF V600E/K mutant melanoma, but the efficacy of dMAPKi in  non-V600 BRAF mutant tumors is poorly understood. We sought to characterize the  responsiveness of class II (enhanced kinase activity, dimerization dependent)  BRAF mutant melanoma to dMAPKi. EXPERIMENTAL DESIGN: Tumors from patients with BRAF wild-type (WT), V600E (class  I), and L597S (class II) metastatic melanoma were used to generate  patient-derived xenografts (PDX). We assembled a panel of melanoma cell lines  with class IIa (activation segment) or IIb (p-loop) mutations and compared these  with WT or V600E/K BRAF mutant cells. Cell lines and PDXs were treated with  BRAFi (vemurafenib, dabrafenib, encorafenib, and LY3009120), MEKi (cobimetinib,  trametinib, and binimetinib), or the combination. We identified 2 patients with  BRAF L597S metastatic melanoma who were treated with dMAPKi. RESULTS: BRAFi impaired MAPK signaling and cell growth in class I and II BRAF  mutant cells. dMAPKi was more effective than either single MAPKi at inhibiting  cell growth in all class II BRAF mutant cells tested. dMAPKi caused tumor  regression in two melanoma PDXs with class II BRAF mutations and prolonged  survival of mice with class II BRAF mutant melanoma brain metastases. Two  patients with BRAF L597S mutant melanoma clinically responded to dMAPKi. CONCLUSIONS: Class II BRAF mutant melanoma is growth inhibited by dMAPKi.  Responses to dMAPKi have been observed in 2 patients with class II BRAF mutant  melanoma. These data provide rationale for clinical investigation of dMAPKi in  patients with class II BRAF mutant metastatic melanoma.See related commentary by  Johnson and Dahlman, p. 6107.', 'Encorafenib (Braftovi™), a BRAF inhibitor, and binimetinib (Mektovi®), a MEK  inhibitor, are two orally bioavailable drugs developed by Array BioPharma. In  June 2018 they each received their first global approval, in the USA, for use in  combination, for patients with unresectable or metastatic melanoma with a  BRAFV600E or -V600K mutation as detected by an FDA-approved test. Registration  applications for encorafenib and binimetinib for use in combination in the  treatment of BRAF-mutation-positive advanced melanoma have also been submitted  in the EU, Australia, Switzerland and Japan, with the EMA Committee for  Medicinal Products for Human Use adopting a positive opinion in July 2018  towards granting the drugs marketing authorizations in the EU. Encorafenib plus  binimetinib combination therapy is also in ongoing phase\xa0III clinical  development in the treatment of metastatic colorectal cancer. This article  summarizes the milestones in the development of encorafenib and binimetinib  leading to these first approvals for the treatment of BRAFV600E or  -V600K-mutation-positive unresectable or metastatic melanoma.', 'PURPOSE OF REVIEW: To describe the pharmacological properties, preclinical and  clinical data of the novel V-Raf Murine Sarcoma Viral Oncogene Homolog B  (BRAF)-inhibitor encorafenib (LGX818) and to compare these with established  BRAF-inhibitors in the treatment of locally advanced or metastatic melanoma. RECENT FINDINGS: Encorafenib has shown improved efficacy in the treatment of  metastatic melanoma in comparison with vemurafenib. Combination with the MEK  inhibitor (MEKi) binimetinib allows for higher dose intensities of encorafenib  further improving response rates (RRs). SUMMARY: Combination therapy with BRAF and MEKi has evolved as a standard of  care in the treatment of locally advanced or metastatic BRAF-mutated melanoma.  Despite compelling initial RRs, development of treatment resistance eventually  leads to tumor progression in the majority of BRAF/MEK-inhibitor treated  patients. Moreover, treatment-related adverse events are frequent, resulting in  a substantial proportion of dose modifications and/or treatment  discontinuations. The second-generation BRAF inhibitor encorafenib has been  developed aiming at improved efficacy and tolerability through modifications in  pharmacological properties. Clinical phase 3 data show improved progression-free  survival both for encorafenib monotherapy and combination therapy with  binimetinib compared with vemurafenib. Overall survival data and regulatory  approval of this novel substance are eagerly awaited.']]]",Encorafenib inhibits the BRAF kinase.,"[{'Exact': array([ 1.8663386 , -0.74803619,  2.02443795, -0.38248605, -0.20586383,

What is commotio cordis?,"[[['Over the last few years, the recognised cardiovascular risks of sporting  activities have been extended to include cardiac arrest resulting from  low-energy precordial chest impact produced by projectiles (e.g. baseball) or  bodily contact, in the young, healthy and active athlete [also known as commotio  cordis (CC)]. However, case reports of CC in European medical literature can be  traced back for at least 130 years. CC accounts for a small, but important,  subset of sudden death during sporting activities. It is a devastating  electrophysiological event in the young athlete, and one which has generated  considerable concern, both in the medical profession as well as in the public.  The mechanism of sudden death appears to be caused by ventricular fibrillation,  which occurs when the chest impact is delivered within a narrow, electrically  vulnerable portion of the cardiac cycle, that is, during repolarisation, just  before the peak of the T wave. Resuscitation of these victims is possible with  prompt cardiopulmonary resuscitation and defibrillation. Preventive measures,  such as the use of age-appropriate safety baseballs and suitably designed chest  wall protection, may reduce the risk of sudden death and, thus, make the  athletic field a safer place for young athletes.', 'Cardiac concussion, previously known as commotio cordis, occurs in structurally  normal hearts without gross or microscopic injury to the myocardium, cardiac  valves, or coronary arteries, as opposed to other sports-related deaths known to  occur more frequently in structural or congenital heart disease. We describe the  sudden cardiac death of a 2-year-old child, who died as a result of a blunt  force impact to the chest. A thorough medicolegal investigation was necessary to  determine that the child died as a result of foul play.', 'Sudden arrhythmic death as a result of a blunt chest wall blow has been termed  Commotio Cordis (CC). CC is being reported with increasing frequency with more  than 180 cases now described in the United States Commotio Cordis Registry. The  clinical spectrum is diverse; however young athletes tend to be most at risk,  with victims commonly being struck by projectiles regarded as standard  implements of the sport. Sudden death is instantaneous and victims are most  often found in ventricular fibrillation (VF). Chest blows are not of sufficient  magnitude to cause any significant damage to overlying thoracic structures and  autopsy is notable for the absence of any structural cardiac injury. Development  of an experimental model has allowed for substantial insights into the  underlying mechanisms of sudden death. In anesthetized juvenile swine, induction  of VF is instantaneous following chest impacts that occur during a vulnerable  window before the T wave peak. Other critical variables, including the impact  velocity and location, and the hardness of the impact object have also been  identified. Rapid left ventricular pressure rise following chest impact likely  results in activation of ion channels via mechano-electric coupling. The  generation of inward current through mechano-sensitive ion channels results in  augmentation of repolarization and non-uniform myocardial activation, and is the  cause of premature ventricular depolarizations that are triggers of VF in CC.  Currently available chest protectors commonly used in sport are not adequately  designed to prevent CC. The development of more effective chest protectors and  the widespread availability of automated external defibrillators at youth  sporting events could improve the safety of young athletes.', 'Commotio cordis is a recognised cause of sudden death in which an apparently  minor blow to the chest causes ventricular fibrillation and cardiac arrest. It  is best known for causing death during games of youth baseball in the United  States, but individual cases have been recorded as a result of a wide range of  activities, principally sporting. The underlying biochemical and  mechano-electric causes have been well documented. However, there are few  reported cases where commotio cordis is implicated as the cause of death in  homicide cases. We present three cases from the north-east of England where an  assault caused death by this mechanism.', ""BACKGROUND: Sudden death due to low-energy blunt trauma to the precordium  (commotio cordis) has been described with a variety of sporting objects.  However, the risk of ventricular fibrillation (VF) relative to the shape of the  impact object is not known. OBJECTIVE: The objective of the current experiment is to test whether the impact  object shape is a clinical variable that affects the risk for commotio cordis. METHODS: In a juvenile swine model, impacts were given in random order with two  different spherical shapes (72 mm diameter, equivalent to a baseball; 42 mm  diameter, equivalent to a golf ball) and a flat round object 72 mm in diameter.  Objects were equal in weight (150 g), thrown at 30 mph, and gated to the  vulnerable portion of the cardiac cycle. RESULTS: Sixteen swine received 144 impacts. The flat object did not cause VF (P  = .01 compared with the two spherical objects), nonsustained VF, ST elevation,  or bundle branch block. The smaller diameter sphere caused VF in nine of 48  impacts (19%), and the larger diameter sphere caused VF in five of 48 impacts  (10%; P = .25). The smaller diameter sphere was associated with a greater  increase in left ventricular pressure (P <.0001 and P = .001 compared with  larger sphere only) and a higher likelihood of ST segment elevations (P <.001  and P = .08 compared with larger sphere only) and bundle branch block (Fisher's  exact P = .008, and Fisher's exact P = .18 compared with larger sphere only). CONCLUSION: The shape of the projectile markedly influences the risk of VF from  chest wall impact. This effect is likely mediated via a greater increase in left  ventricular pressure with smaller diameter objects. Spreading the impact force  over a larger area may decrease the risk of sudden death and has implications  for the design of protective athletic equipment."", 'Blunt, non-penetrating trauma of the chest (commotio cordis) can cause sudden  death in individuals without known cardiac disease. Sudden death in commotio  cordis is due to ventricular fibrillation. The timing of the blow must be during  the electric vulnerable period of the ECG cyclus, 10-40 milliseconds before the  peak of the T-wave. The risk of arrhythmia increases progressively, until a  velocity of 64 km/h, and at higher velocities the risk of ventricular  fibrillation begins to diminish. The location of the impact must be directly  over the cardiac silhouette.', 'Sudden arrhythmic death as a result of a blunt chest wall blow has been termed  Commotio Cordis (CC).

This is the most severe  expression of a condition termed, in the 19th century, Commotio cordis.  Experimental studies performed in the early 1930s showed that sudden cardiac  death after chest impact is brought about by an intrinsic cardiac response to  the mechanical stimulus. The precise (sub-)cellular mechanisms of this response  are still poorly understood. This article summarises experimental findings on  the condition and relates them to the more recently established concept of  cardiac mechano-electric feedback. As a result, an explanation of the mechanisms  that give rise to sudden cardiac death by Commotio cordis and targets for  further research are suggested.', 'Blunt, non-penetrating trauma of the chest (commotio cordis) can cause sudden  death in individuals without known cardiac disease.

This is the fifth recorded hockey death related  to so-called commotio cordis, that is, blunt chest injury without myocardial  structural damage. In light of inadequacies of commercial chest protectors  currently in use for hockey, the authors hope to educate players and coaches  about the danger of blocking shots with the chest. Physicians should be aware  that commotio cordis represents a distinctive pathological condition, in the  event of which immediate recognition, precordial thump, CPR, and defibrillation  are potentially lifesaving. Appropriate medical supervision at amateur hockey  games, 911 telephone access, and on-site automated external defibrillators are  issues that deserve careful consideration.']]]","Commotio cordis is a condition characterized by sudden cardiac death in individuals without known structural heart disease, typically occurring after a seemingly minor blow to the precordial area, usually during sports activities like baseball or hockey. It is triggered by ventricular fibrillation, which happens when a chest impact occurs during a specific, electrically vulnerable period of the cardiac cycle, specifically shortly before the peak of the T wave. The risk of arrhythmia increases with the velocity of the impact, and it is most common in young, healthy athletes. Despite the presence of a blow, there is no significant damage to overlying thoracic structures, and autopsies show no structural cardiac injury. Prevention involves using age-appropriate safety equipment and ensuring access to automated external defibrillators.","[{'Exact': array([65.7137496 ,  3.01989876, 47.52918216,  9.72725693,  5.74369764,

Which gene is involved in CADASIL?,"[[['Cerebral autosomal dominant arteriopathy with subcortical infarcts and  leukoencephalopathy, or CADASIL, one of the most common inherited small vessel  diseases of the brain, is characterized by a progressive loss of vascular smooth  muscle cells and extracellular matrix accumulation. The disease is caused by  highly stereotyped mutations within the extracellular domain of the NOTCH3  receptor (Notch3(ECD)) that result in an odd number of cysteine residues. While  CADASIL-associated NOTCH3 mutations differentially affect NOTCH3 receptor  function and activity, they all are associated with early accumulation of  Notch3(ECD)-containing aggregates in small vessels. We still lack mechanistic  explanation to link NOTCH3 mutations with small vessel pathology. Herein, we  hypothesized that excess Notch3(ECD) could recruit and sequester functionally  important proteins within small vessels of the brain. We performed biochemical,  nano-liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry and immunohistochemical  analyses, using cerebral and arterial tissue derived from patients with CADASIL  and mouse models of CADASIL that exhibit vascular lesions in the end- and  early-stage of the disease, respectively. Biochemical fractionation of brain and  artery samples demonstrated that mutant Notch3(ECD) accumulates in disulphide  cross-linked detergent-insoluble aggregates in mice and patients with CADASIL.  Further proteomic and immunohistochemical analyses identified two functionally  important extracellular matrix proteins, tissue inhibitor of metalloproteinases  3 (TIMP3) and vitronectin (VTN) that are sequestered into Notch3(ECD)-containing  aggregates. Using cultured cells, we show that increased levels or aggregation  of Notch3 enhances the formation of Notch3(ECD)-TIMP3 complex, promoting TIMP3  recruitment and accumulation. In turn, TIMP3 promotes complex formation  including NOTCH3 and VTN. In vivo, brain vessels from mice and patients with  CADASIL exhibit elevated levels of both insoluble cross-linked and soluble TIMP3  species. Moreover, reverse zymography assays show a significant elevation of  TIMP3 activity in the brain vessels from mice and patients with CADASIL.  Collectively, our findings lend support to a Notch3(ECD) cascade hypothesis in  CADASIL disease pathology, which posits that aggregation/accumulation of  Notch3(ECD) in the brain vessels is a central event, promoting the abnormal  recruitment of functionally important extracellular matrix proteins that may  ultimately cause multifactorial toxicity. Specifically, our results suggest a  dysregulation of TIMP3 activity, which could contribute to mutant Notch3(ECD)  toxicity by impairing extracellular matrix homeostasis in small vessels.', 'BACKGROUND: Ultrastructural and biochemical abnormalities of mitochondria have  been reported in skeletal muscle biopsies of CADASIL patients with mutations in  the NOTCH3 nuclear gene. Additionally, it was proposed that NOTCH3 gene  mutations may predispose the mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) to mutations. METHODS: We sequenced the entire mitochondrial genome in five Arab patients  affected by CADASIL. RESULTS: The mean number of mtDNA sequence variants (synonymous and  nonsynonymous) in CADASIL patients was not statistically significantly different  from that in controls (p = 0.378). After excluding haplogroup specific single  nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) and proved silent polymorphisms, no known or  novel pathologic mtDNA mutation(s) could be detected in any patient.  Additionally, there was no difference in the prevalence of different  mitochondrial haplogroups between patients and controls. CONCLUSION: Our study group is too small for any valid conclusion to be made.  However, if our observation is confirmed in larger study group, then mtDNA  mutations or mitochondrial haplogroups may not be important in the pathogenesis  of CADASIL.', 'Cerebral autosomal dominant arteriopathy with subcortical infarcts and  leukoencephalopathy (CADASIL) is a vascular dementing disease caused by  mutations in the NOTCH3 gene, most which are missense mutations leading to an  uneven number of cysteine residues in epidermal growth factor-like repeats in  the extracellular domain of Notch3 receptor (N3ECD). CADASIL is characterized by  degeneration of vascular smooth muscle cells (VSMC) and accumulation of N3ECD on  the VSMCs of small and middle-sized arteries. Recent studies have demonstrated  that impairment of Notch3 signaling is not the primary cause of the disease. In  the present study we used proteomic analysis to characterize the protein  expression pattern of a unique material of genetically genuine cultured human  CADASIL VSMCs. We identified 11 differentially expressed proteins, which are  involved in protein degradation and folding, contraction of VSMCs, and cellular  stress. Our findings indicate that misfolding of Notch3 may cause endoplasmic  reticulum stress and activation of unfolded protein response, leading to  increased reactive oxygen species and inhibition of cell proliferation. In  addition, upregulation of contractile proteins suggests an alteration in the  signaling system of VSMC contraction. The accumulation of N3ECD on the cell  surface possibly upregulates the angiotensin II regulatory feedback loop and  thereby enhances the readiness of the cells to respond to angiotensin II  stimulation.', 'Cerebral autosomal dominant arteriopathy with subcortical infarcts and  leukoencephalopathy (CADASIL) is caused by mutations in the NOTCH3 gene and is  clinically characterized by recurrent stroke, cognitive decline, psychiatric  disturbances and migraine. The prevalence of migraine in CADASIL is slightly  higher than in the general population, and the proportion of migraine with aura  is much higher. The pathophysiological mechanism that leads to increased aura  prevalence in CADASIL is unknown. Possible mechanisms of the excess of migraine  with aura are an increased susceptibility to cortical spreading depression (CSD)  or a different expression of CSD. It is also possible that the brainstem  migraine area is involved in CADASIL. Last, it is possible that the NOTCH3  mutation acts as a migraine aura susceptibility gene by itself. In this  narrative review we summarize the literature about migraine in CADASIL, with a  special focus on what CADASIL might teach us about the pathophysiology of  migraine.', 'OBJECTIVE: To elucidate the phenotype, genotype, and MRI findings of Korean  patients with cerebral autosomal dominant arteriopathy with subcortical infarcts  and leukoencephalopathy (CADASIL) and mutation carriers. METHODS: The authors studied 40 members of nine unrelated Korean CADASIL  families. After genetic analysis of Notch3, clinical and MRI findings were  correlated in 27 mutation carriers. RESULT: Notch3 mutation sites were C174R (one family, n = 3), R133C (one family,  n = 3), R587C (one family, n = 1), R544C (two families, n = 5), and R75P (four  families, n = 15). The clinical features were typical of CADASIL, but the  frequency of migraine in the Korean population appears low. MRI abnormalities  were found in 54% of the mutant carriers, the most common being white matter  hyperintensities. The prevalence of lacunes and microbleeds increased with  patient age. Anterior temporal areas were less often involved in subjects with  R75P mutations than in those where mutations occurred in other sites (p = 0.02).  Gradient echo imaging identified microbleedings in 33% of mutation carriers (64%  of those with abnormal MRI), whereas diffusion-weighted MRI showed abnormal  findings in only one patient. Neurologic disability was related to the number of  lacunar infarcts and the lesion volume of white matter hyperintensities (p <  0.001) whereas MMSE score was related to the number of lacunar infarcts (p <  0.005). CONCLUSIONS: Although Korean cerebral autosomal dominant arteriopathy with  subcortical infarcts and leukoencephalopathy (CADASIL) mutation carriers show  similar clinical and MRI findings, these abnormalities appear less frequently  than in other populations. Relatively frequent microbleedings on gradient echo  imaging suggest that treatment should be individualized according to MRI  findings. The novel mutation of R75P, not involving a cysteine residue, is  related to less frequent involvement of the anterior temporal area, thus  broadening the spectrum of CADASIL.', 'Notch3 is a single pass transmembrane protein belonging to the Notch receptor  family. Notch proteins are involved in a very conserved signaling system (Notch  signaling) with a broad spectrum of functions, from cell proliferation and  differentiation to apoptosis. Mutations in Notch3 gene are linked to cerebral  autosomal dominant arteriopathy with subcortical infarcts and  leukoencephalopathy (CADASIL), a disorder characterized by stroke and dementia  in young adults. Studies evaluating Notch3 expression in human differentiated  cells and adult tissues have shown high Notch3 levels only in vascular smooth  muscle cells (VSMC). However, it has been hypothesized that Notch3 is  ubiquitously expressed in adult human tissues. Our aim was to evaluate Notch3  expression in human peripheral blood lymphocytes (PBLs) and fibroblasts from  normal healthy subjects. In both cell types, we examined the expression of  Notch3 by reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) and  quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction (qRT-PCR). Moreover, we  assessed Notch3 protein expression by Western blot analysis. RT-PCR and qRT-PCR  analysis showed the presence of Notch3 mRNA in both cell types. Western blot  analysis confirmed Notch3 protein expression in PBLs and fibroblasts though  showing different profiles. Our data support the expression of Notch3 in adult  human cell types, and suggests that PBLs and fibroblasts could provide readily  available cells for the study of the role of Notch3 expression in the  pathogenetic mechanisms leading to different human disease.', 'Cerebral Autosomal Dominant Arteriopathy with Subcortical Infarcts and  Leukoencephalopathy (CADASIL) is the best understood cause of dominantly  inherited stroke and results from NOTCH3 mutations that lead to NOTCH3 protein  accumulation and selective arterial smooth muscle degeneration. Previous studies  show that NOTCH3 protein forms multimers. Here, we investigate protein  interactions between NOTCH3 and other vascular Notch isoforms and characterize  the effects of elevated NOTCH3 on smooth muscle gene regulation. We demonstrate  that NOTCH3 forms heterodimers with NOTCH1, NOTCH3, and NOTCH4. R90C and C49Y  mutant NOTCH3 form complexes which are more resistant to detergents than wild  type NOTCH3 complexes. Using quantitative NOTCH3-luciferase clearance assays, we  found significant inhibition of mutant NOTCH3 clearance. In coculture assays of  NOTCH function, overexpressed wild type and mutant NOTCH3 significantly  repressed NOTCH-regulated smooth muscle transcripts and potently impaired the  activity of three independent smooth muscle promoters. Wildtype and R90C  recombinant NOTCH3 proteins applied to cell cultures also blocked canonical  Notch fuction. We conclude that CADASIL mutants of NOTCH3 complex with NOTCH1,  3, and 4, slow NOTCH3 clearance, and that overexpressed wild type and mutant  NOTCH3 protein interfere with key NOTCH-mediated functions in smooth muscle  cells.', ""Le CADASIL, ou Cerebral autosomal dominant arteriopathy with subcortical  infarcts and Ieukoencephalopathy est une affection héréditaire des petites  artères cérébrabes survenant chez l'adulte d'âge moyen, due à des mutations du  gène Notch3.

Available data were found  through Medline/PubMed using the keyword ""cerebral autosomal dominant  arteriopathy with subcortical infarcts and leukoencephalopathy (CADASIL)"". The  search was restricted to studies published in English in the years between 1993  and 2008. We excluded studies that did not report original data on CADASIL and  information regarding the presence of headache. We found 34 studies reporting  data on 749 patients overall; 387 (51.7%) patients had headache. According to  the authors\' definition, 356 (92%) patients were reported as having migraine and  31 (8%) as having headache. Of the 356 patients who were defined as migraineurs,  125 (35.1%) had migraine with aura, 7 (2%) migraine without aura, 156 (43.8%)  unspecified migraine and 68 (19.1%) had more than one type of migraine. Among  the 31 patients reported as suffering from headache, the headache was not  further detailed in 18 (58.1%) patients; it was defined as chronic in 6 (19.3%),  as resembling migraine with aura in 4 (12.9%), as resembling migraine without  aura in 2 (6.5%) and as tension type in 1 (3.2%) patient. In patients with  CADASIL, the headache was usually referred to as migraine and mostly as migraine  with aura. However, this referral is formally incorrect since the diagnostic  criteria for any type of migraine in the ICHD-II require that the disturbance is  not attributed to another disorder. For this reason, we suggest updating the  ICHD-II in relation to CADASIL. Our suggestion is to insert a new category  referred to as Headache attributed to genetic disorder including Headache  attributed to CADASIL.', 'Cerebral autosomal dominant arteriopathy with subcortical infarcts and  leucoencephalopathy (CADASIL) is the most common heritable cause of stroke and  vascular dementia in adults. Clinical and neuroimaging features resemble those  of sporadic small-artery disease, although patients with CADASIL have an earlier  age at onset of stroke events, an increased frequency of migraine with aura, and  a slightly variable pattern of ischaemic white-matter lesions on brain MRI.  NOTCH3 (Notch homolog 3), the gene involved in CADASIL, encodes a transmembrane  receptor primarily expressed in systemic arterial smooth-muscle cells.  Pathogenetic mutations alter the number of cysteine residues in the  extracellular domain of NOTCH3, which accumulates in small arteries of affected  individuals. Functional and imaging studies in cultured cells, genetically  engineered mice, and patients with CADASIL have all provided insights into the  molecular and vascular mechanisms underlying this disease. A recent multicentre  trial in patients with cognitive impairment emphasises the feasibility of  randomised trials in patients with CADASIL. In this Review, we summarise the  current understanding of CADASIL, a devastating disorder that also serves as a  model for the more common forms of subcortical ischaemic strokes and pure  vascular dementia.']]]",The gene involved in CADASIL is NOTCH3.,"[{'Exact': array([ 1.27872587,  0.78025353,  0.97541656,  0.47777977,  0.14073982,

Is dupilumab effective for treatment of asthma?,"[[[""BACKGROUND: Several new biologics have been studied in patients with  eosinophilic asthma with varying degrees of response on clinical outcomes. No  head-to-head trial has directly compared the efficacy of these drugs. OBJECTIVE: To synthesize data on the relative efficacy of benralizumab,  dupilumab, lebrikizumab, mepolizumab, reslizumab, and tralokinumab using network  meta-analysis. DATA SOURCES: We searched PubMed from inception to December 15th, 2017. DATA EXTRACTION AND SYNTHESIS: We used the 'frequentist' methodology with random  effect models using primarily 'netmeta' function in R to generate network  meta-analysis results. Outcomes assessed included changes in forced expiratory  volume-in 1\xa0s (FEV1), asthma control questionnaire (ACQ), and asthma quality of  life questionnaire (AQLQ). We also separately analyzed the annualized rate  ratios for asthma exacerbations for each drug and compared to placebo. For all  outcomes assessed, all drugs were superior to placebo except tralokinumab. In  terms of magnitude of effect, dupilumab, followed by reslizumab and benralizumab  showed the greatest increase in FEV1, 0.16L (95% CIs: 0.08-0.24), 0.13L  (0.10-0.17), and 0.12L (0.08-0.17), compared to placebo. While mepolizumab,  followed by dupliumab, benralizumab, and reslizumab showed reductions in ACQ  scores, in order of magnitude of effect, dupilumab, followed by mepolizumab,  benralizumab, and reslizumab showed the greatest increase in AQLQ scores. All  drugs decreased asthma exacerbations but the results were only significant for  reslizumab and dupilumab. CONCLUSIONS: All drugs except for tralokinumab showed improvements in FEV1, ACQ,  and AQLQ. Only reslizumab and dupilumab were associated with statistically  significant reductions in asthma exacerbation rates."", ""BACKGROUND: Data from early-stage studies suggested that interleukin (IL)-4 and  IL-13 are requisite drivers of atopic dermatitis, evidenced by marked  improvement after treatment with dupilumab, a fully-human monoclonal antibody  that blocks both pathways. We aimed to assess the efficacy and safety of several  dose regimens of dupilumab in adults with moderate-to-severe atopic dermatitis  inadequately controlled by topical treatments. METHODS: In this randomised, placebo-controlled, double-blind study, we enrolled  patients aged 18 years or older who had an Eczema Area and Severity Index (EASI)  score of 12 or higher at screening (≥16 at baseline) and inadequate response to  topical treatments from 91 study centres, including hospitals, clinics, and  academic institutions, in Canada, Czech Republic, Germany, Hungary, Japan,  Poland, and the USA. Patients were randomly assigned (1:1:1:1:1:1), stratified  by severity (moderate or severe, as assessed by Investigator's Global  Assessment) and region (Japan vs rest of world) to receive subcutaneous  dupilumab: 300 mg once a week, 300 mg every 2 weeks, 200 mg every 2 weeks, 300  mg every 4 weeks, 100 mg every 4 weeks, or placebo once a week for 16 weeks. We  used a central randomisation scheme, provided by an interactive voice response  system. Drug kits were coded, providing masking to treatment assignment, and  allocation was concealed. Patients on treatment every 2 weeks and every 4 weeks  received volume-matched placebo every week when dupilumab was not given to  ensure double blinding. The primary outcome was efficacy of dupilumab dose  regimens based on EASI score least-squares mean percentage change (SE) from  baseline to week 16. Analyses included all randomly assigned patients who  received one or more doses of study drug. This trial is registered with  ClinicalTrials.gov, number NCT01859988. FINDINGS: Between May 15, 2013, and Jan 27, 2014, 452 patients were assessed for  eligibility, and 380 patients were randomly assigned. 379 patients received one  or more doses of study drug (300 mg once a week [n=63], 300 mg every 2 weeks  [n=64], 200 mg every 2 weeks [n=61], 300 mg every 4 weeks [n=65], 100 mg every 4  weeks [n=65]; placebo [n=61]). EASI score improvements favoured all dupilumab  regimens versus placebo (p<0·0001): 300 mg once a week (-74% [SE 5·16]), 300 mg  every 2 weeks (-68% [5·12]), 200 mg every 2 weeks (-65% [5·19]), 300 mg every 4  weeks (-64% [4·94]), 100 mg every 4 weeks (-45% [4·99]); placebo (-18% [5·20]).  258 (81%) of 318 patients given dupilumab and 49 (80%) of 61 patients given  placebo reported treatment-emergent adverse events; nasopharyngitis was the most  frequent (28% and 26%, respectively). INTERPRETATION: Dupilumab improved clinical responses in adults with  moderate-to-severe atopic dermatitis in a dose-dependent manner, without  significant safety concerns. Our findings show that IL-4 and IL-13 are key  drivers of atopic dermatitis. FUNDING: Sanofi and Regeneron Pharmaceuticals."", 'Dupilumab inhibits the interleukin-4 receptor subunit α and is FDA approved for  treatment of moderate-to-severe atopic dermatitis. It is a relatively new drug,  and whether it is efficacious for other diseases in dermatology is an area of  increasing interest. We searched the literature and ClinicalTrials.gov database  for uses of dupilumab beyond atopic dermatitis in dermatology and for ongoing  studies on new uses for dupilumab. Off-label reports identified described use of  dupilumab for several different dermatologic conditions, including allergic  contact dermatitis, hand dermatitis, chronic spontaneous urticaria, prurigo  nodularis, and alopecia areata. Overall, there is limited but promising data for  dupilumab use beyond atopic dermatitis in dermatology. The relatively safe  adverse effect profile of dupilumab may make it an option for certain  recalcitrant diseases in dermatology, but further studies will be needed to  assess its efficacy and determine its best possible use. J Drugs Dermatol.  2019;18(10):1053-1055.', 'Dupilumab (REGN668/SAR231893), produced by a collaboration between Regeneron and  Sanofi, is a monoclonal antibody currently in phase III for moderate-to-severe  asthma. Dupilumab is directed against the α-subunit of the interleukin (IL)-4  receptor and blocks the IL-4 and IL-13 signal transduction. Areas covered:  Pathophysiological role of IL-4 and IL-13 in asthma; mechanism of action of  dupilumab; pharmacology of IL-4 receptor; phase I and phase II studies with  dupilumab; regulatory affairs. Expert opinion: Patients with severe asthma who  are not sufficiently controlled with standard-of-care represent the target  asthma population for dupilumab. If confirmed, efficacy of dupilumab in both  eosinophilic and non-eosinophilic severe asthma phenotype might represent an  advantage over approved biologics for asthma, including omalizumab, mepolizumab,  and reslizumab. Head-to-head studies to compare dupilumab versus other biologics  with different mechanism of action are required. Pediatric studies with  dupilumab are currently lacking and should be undertaken to assess efficacy and  safety of this drug in children with severe asthma. The lack of preclinical data  and published results of the completed four phase I studies precludes a complete  assessment of the pharmacological profile of dupilumab. Dupilumab seems to be  generally well tolerated, but large studies are required to establish its  long-term safety and tolerability.', 'Atopic dermatitis (AD) is characterized by type 2 helper T (Th2) cell-driven  inflammation. Dupilumab is a fully human monoclonal antibody directed against  the IL-4 receptor α subunit that blocks the signaling of IL-4 and IL-13, both  key cytokines in Th2-mediated pathways. In Phase I and II studies of adults with  moderate-to-severe AD, dupilumab administered as monotherapy or with topical  corticosteroids resulted in rapid, significant improvements in clinical  efficacy, patient-reported outcomes, and Th2-related serum and tissue  biomarkers, and shifted the RNA expression profile of lesional skin to a more  nonlesional signature. In all clinical studies to date, dupilumab has shown a  favorable safety profile with no dose-limiting toxicity. The robust effects of  dupilumab on skin inflammation and pruritus confirm the pathogenic role of IL-4  and IL-13 signaling in adult AD, and further support the application of Th2  cytokine antagonists in the treatment of this disease.', 'Asthma is a heterogeneous inflammatory disease. Most patients respond to current  standard of care, i.e., bronchodilators, inhaled glucocorticosteroids and other  anti-inflammatory drugs, but in some adequate asthma control cannot be achieved  with standard treatments. These difficult-to-treat patients would be the target  population for new biological therapies. At present, omalizumab is the only  biological agent approved for the treatment of early-onset, severe IgE-dependent  asthma. It is safe, effective, and well tolerated. Also, discovery of asthma  subtypes suggests new treatments. Half of patients with severe asthma have  T-helper type 2 (Th-2) inflammation and they are expected to benefit from  monoclonal antibody-based treatments. The efficacy of the investigational  monoclonal antibody mepolizumab which targets IL-5 has been well documented in  late onset non-atopic asthma with persistent eosinophilic airway inflammation.  Anti-IL-4 and IL-13 agents (dupilumab, lebrikizumab, and tralokinumab) which  block different Th-2 inflammatory pathways and agents targeting the Th-17  inflammatory pathway in severe refractory asthma are under development. In  clinical trials, these drugs reduce disease activity and improve lung function,  asthma symptoms, and quality of life. However, studies on larger groups of  patients are needed to confirm their safety and efficacy.', 'Dupilumab is the first biological treatment approved for moderate-to-severe  atopic dermatitis (AD). Efficacy and safety have been demonstrated in clinical  trials, but real-life data is still limited. The objective of this study was to  retrospectively evaluate Dupilumab treatment in AD patients in a real-life  clinical setting. Effectiveness and safety outcomes were collected at baseline  and after 2, 6, 10, 24, 39, and 52 weeks by using clinical scores for disease  activity, as well as serological markers. Ninety-four patients from five  dermatological hospitals were included. After 24 weeks of treatment, the median  Investigator Global Assessment (IGA) and Eczema Area and Severity Index (EASI)  showed a significant reduction compared to baseline (3.9 ± 0.7 vs. 1.4 ± 0.8 and  26.5 ± 12.5 vs. 6.4 ± 6.5). Interestingly, we observed rosacea-like folliculitis  as an unexpected side effect in 6.4% of patients. Dupilumab proves to be an  effective and well-tolerated treatment under real-life conditions. The  occurrence of rosacea-like folliculitis warrants further mechanistic  investigation.', 'BACKGROUND: Monoclonal antibodies targeting IgE, interleukin-4 and -13, and  interleukin-5 are effective in treating severe type 2 asthma, but new targets  are needed. Itepekimab is a new monoclonal antibody against the upstream alarmin  interleukin-33. The efficacy and safety of itepekimab as monotherapy, as well as  in combination with dupilumab, in patients with asthma are unclear. METHODS: In a phase 2 trial, we randomly assigned, in a 1:1:1:1 ratio, adults  with moderate-to-severe asthma receiving inhaled glucocorticoids plus  long-acting beta-agonists (LABAs) to receive subcutaneous itepekimab (at a dose  of 300 mg), itepekimab plus dupilumab (both at 300 mg; combination therapy),  dupilumab (300 mg), or placebo every 2 weeks for 12 weeks. After randomization,  LABA was discontinued at week 4, and inhaled glucocorticoids were tapered over  weeks 6 through 9. The primary end point was an event indicating a loss of  asthma control, assessed in the itepekimab group and the combination group, as  compared with the placebo group. Secondary and other end points included lung  function, asthma control, quality of life, type 2 biomarkers, and safety. RESULTS: A total of 296 patients underwent randomization. By 12 weeks, an event  indicating a loss of asthma control occurred in 22% of the patients in the  itepekimab group, 27% of those in the combination group, and 19% of those in the  dupilumab group, as compared with 41% of those in the placebo group; the  corresponding odds ratios as compared with placebo were as follows: in the  itepekimab group, 0.42 (95% confidence interval [CI], 0.20 to 0.88; P\u2009=\u20090.02);  in the combination group, 0.52 (95% CI, 0.26 to 1.06; P\u2009=\u20090.07); and in the  dupilumab group, 0.33 (95% CI, 0.15 to 0.70). As compared with placebo, the  forced expiratory volume in 1 second before bronchodilator use increased with  the itepekimab and dupilumab monotherapies but not with the combination therapy.  Itepekimab treatment improved asthma control and quality of life, as compared  with placebo, and led to a greater reduction in the mean blood eosinophil count.  The incidence of adverse events was similar in all four trial groups. CONCLUSIONS: Interleukin-33 blockade with itepekimab led to a lower incidence of  events indicating a loss of asthma control than placebo and improved lung  function in patients with moderate-to-severe asthma.

We evaluated the  efficacy and safety of dupilumab (SAR231893/REGN668), a fully human monoclonal  antibody to the alpha subunit of the interleukin-4 receptor, in patients with  persistent, moderate-to-severe asthma and elevated eosinophil levels. METHODS: We enrolled patients with persistent, moderate-to-severe asthma and a  blood eosinophil count of at least 300 cells per microliter or a sputum  eosinophil level of at least 3% who used medium-dose to high-dose inhaled  glucocorticoids plus long-acting beta-agonists (LABAs). We administered  dupilumab (300 mg) or placebo subcutaneously once weekly. Patients were  instructed to discontinue LABAs at week 4 and to taper and discontinue inhaled  glucocorticoids during weeks 6 through 9. Patients received the study drug for  12 weeks or until a protocol-defined asthma exacerbation occurred. The primary  end point was the occurrence of an asthma exacerbation; secondary end points  included a range of measures of asthma control. Effects on various type 2 helper  T-cell (Th2)-associated biomarkers and safety and tolerability were also  evaluated. RESULTS: A total of 52 patients were assigned to the dupilumab group, and 52  patients were assigned to the placebo group. Baseline characteristics were  similar in the two groups. Three patients had an asthma exacerbation with  dupilumab (6%) versus 23 with placebo (44%), corresponding to an 87% reduction  with dupilumab (odds ratio, 0.08; 95% confidence interval, 0.02 to 0.28;  P<0.001). Significant improvements were observed for most measures of lung  function and asthma control. Dupilumab reduced biomarkers associated with  Th2-driven inflammation. Injection-site reactions, nasopharyngitis, nausea, and  headache occurred more frequently with dupilumab than with placebo. CONCLUSIONS: In patients with persistent, moderate-to-severe asthma and elevated  eosinophil levels who used inhaled glucocorticoids and LABAs, dupilumab therapy,  as compared with placebo, was associated with fewer asthma exacerbations when  LABAs and inhaled glucocorticoids were withdrawn, with improved lung function  and reduced levels of Th2-associated inflammatory markers.

We  assessed its efficacy and safety in patients with uncontrolled asthma. METHODS: We randomly assigned 1902 patients 12 years of age or older with  uncontrolled asthma in a 2:2:1:1 ratio to receive add-on subcutaneous dupilumab  at a dose of 200 or 300 mg every 2 weeks or matched-volume placebos for 52  weeks. The primary end points were the annualized rate of severe asthma  exacerbations and the absolute change from baseline to week 12 in the forced  expiratory volume in 1 second (FEV1) before bronchodilator use in the overall  trial population. Secondary end points included the exacerbation rate and FEV1  in patients with a blood eosinophil count of 300 or more per cubic millimeter.  Asthma control and dupilumab safety were also assessed. RESULTS: The annualized rate of severe asthma exacerbations was 0.46 (95%  confidence interval [CI], 0.39 to 0.53) among patients assigned to 200 mg of  dupilumab every 2 weeks and 0.87 (95% CI, 0.72 to 1.05) among those assigned to  a matched placebo, for a 47.7% lower rate with dupilumab than with placebo  (P<0.001); similar results were seen with the dupilumab dose of 300 mg every 2  weeks. At week 12, the FEV1 had increased by 0.32 liters in patients assigned to  the lower dose of dupilumab (difference vs. matched placebo, 0.14 liters;  P<0.001); similar results were seen with the higher dose. Among patients with a  blood eosinophil count of 300 or more per cubic millimeter, the annualized rate  of severe asthma exacerbations was 0.37 (95% CI, 0.29 to 0.48) among those  receiving lower-dose dupilumab and 1.08 (95% CI, 0.85 to 1.38) among those  receiving a matched placebo (65.8% lower rate with dupilumab than with placebo;  95% CI, 52.0 to 75.6); similar results were observed with the higher dose. Blood  eosinophilia occurred after the start of the intervention in 52 patients (4.1%)  who received dupilumab as compared with 4 patients (0.6%) who received placebo. CONCLUSIONS: In this trial, patients who received dupilumab had significantly  lower rates of severe asthma exacerbation than those who received placebo, as  well as better lung function and asthma control. Greater benefits were seen in  patients with higher baseline levels of eosinophils. Hypereosinophilia was  observed in some patients.

Is there a mouse model for Fanconi anemia?,"[[['Fanconi anemia (FA) is a rare, autosomal recessive disorder characterized by  elevated frequencies of chromosome aberrations, hypersensitivity to DNA  cross-linking agents and predisposition to cancer. At least 5 complementation  groups (FA-A to FA-E) underlie FA and the gene defective in FA-C (FAC) has been  cloned. The mouse orthologue, Fac, maps in close proximity to the f locus, on  chromosome 13, which codes for the flexed-tail mouse phenotype, raising the  possibility that f and Fac are synonymous. If this were the case flexed-tail  mice could be used as mouse models for FA-C to help determine the basic defect  and to evaluate clinical intervention and gene therapy. To further characterize  the flexed-tail mouse, the frequency of micronuclei (a measure of chromosomal  aberrations) induced by mitomycin C (MMC), an alkylating and DNA cross-linking  agent, was analyzed in peripheral blood and bone marrow erythrocytes. Although a  higher spontaneous micronucleus frequency was seen in flexed tail mice in  comparison to wild-type mice, the sensitivity to MMC was not elevated. This  result suggests that f and Fac are different genes and that the flexed-tail  mouse is not a model for FA-C.', 'Fanconi anemia (FA) is a genetically heterogeneous, autosomal recessive disorder  characterized by pediatric bone marrow failure and congenital anomalies. The  effect of FA gene deficiency on hematopoietic development in utero remains  poorly described as mouse models of FA do not develop hematopoietic failure and  such studies cannot be performed on patients. We have created a human-specific  in vitro system to study early hematopoietic development in FA using a  lentiviral RNA interference (RNAi) strategy in human embryonic stem cells  (hESCs). We show that knockdown of FANCA and FANCD2 in hESCs leads to a  reduction in hematopoietic fates and progenitor numbers that can be rescued by  FA gene complementation. Our data indicate that hematopoiesis is impaired in FA  from the earliest stages of development, suggesting that deficiencies in  embryonic hematopoiesis may underlie the progression to bone marrow failure in  FA. This work illustrates how hESCs can provide unique insights into human  development and further our understanding of genetic disease.', 'Fanconi anemia (FA) is a genetic disease resulting in bone marrow failure, high  cancer risks, and infertility, and developmental anomalies including  microphthalmia, microcephaly, hypoplastic radius and thumb. Here we present cDNA  sequences, genetic mapping, and genomic analyses for the four previously  undescribed zebrafish FA genes (fanci, fancj, fancm, and fancn), and show that  they reverted to single copy after the teleost genome duplication. We tested the  hypothesis that FA genes are expressed during embryonic development in tissues  that are disrupted in human patients by investigating fanc gene expression  patterns. We found fanc gene maternal message, which can provide Fanc proteins  to repair DNA damage encountered in rapid cleavage divisions. Zygotic expression  was broad but especially strong in eyes, central nervous system and  hematopoietic tissues. In the pectoral fin bud at hatching, fanc genes were  expressed specifically in the apical ectodermal ridge, a signaling center for  fin/limb development that may be relevant to the radius/thumb anomaly of FA  patients. Hatching embryos expressed fanc genes strongly in the oral epithelium,  a site of squamous cell carcinomas in FA patients. Larval and adult zebrafish  expressed fanc genes in proliferative regions of the brain, which may be related  to microcephaly in FA. Mature ovaries and testes expressed fanc genes in  specific stages of oocyte and spermatocyte development, which may be related to  DNA repair during homologous recombination in meiosis and to infertility in  human patients. The intestine strongly expressed some fanc genes specifically in  proliferative zones. Our results show that zebrafish has a complete complement  of fanc genes in single copy and that these genes are expressed in zebrafish  embryos and adults in proliferative tissues that are often affected in FA  patients. These results support the notion that zebrafish offers an attractive  experimental system to help unravel mechanisms relevant not only to FA, but also  to breast cancer, given the involvement of fancj (brip1), fancn (palb2) and  fancd1 (brca2) in both conditions.', 'OBJECTIVE: Fanconi anemia (FA) is a genetically heterogeneous disorder  associated with defects in at least eight genes. The biochemical function(s) of  the FA proteins are unknown, but together they define the FA pathway, which is  involved in cellular responses to DNA damage and in other cellular processes. It  is currently unknown whether all FA proteins are involved in controlling a  single function or whether some of the FA proteins have additional roles. The  aim of this study was 1) to determine whether the FA group A and group C genes  have identical or partially distinct functions, and 2) to have a better model  for human FA. MATERIALS AND METHODS: We generated mice with a targeted mutation in fanca and  crossed them with fancc disrupted animals. Several phenotypes including  sensitivity to DNA cross linkers and ionizing radiation, hematopoietic colony  growth, and germ cell loss were analyzed in fanca-/-, fancc-/-, fanca/fancc  double -/-, and controls. RESULTS: Fibroblast cells and hematopoietic precursors from fanca/fancc  double-mutant mice were not more sensitive to MMC than those of either single  mutant. fanca/fancc double mutants had no evidence for an additive phenotype at  the cellular or organismal level. CONCLUSIONS: These results support a model where both FANCA and FANCC are part  of a multi-protein nuclear FA complex with identical function in cellular  responses to DNA damage and germ cell survival.', 'Fanconi anemia (FA) is a pleiotropic inherited disease that causes bone marrow  failure in children. However, the specific involvement of FA genes in  hematopoiesis and their relation to bone marrow (BM) failure is still unclear.  The increased sensitivity of FA cells to DNA cross-linking agents such as  mitomycin C (MMC) and diepoxybutane (DEB), including the induction of  chromosomal aberrations and delay in the G2 phase of the cell cycle, have  suggested a role for the FA genes in DNA repair, cell cycle regulation, and  apoptosis. We previously reported the cloning of the FA group C gene (FAC) and  the generation of a Fac mouse model. Surprisingly, the Fac -/- mice did not show  any of the hematologic defects found in FA patients. To better understand the  relationship of FA gene functions to BM failure, we have analyzed the in vivo  effect of an FA-specific DNA damaging agent in Fac -/- mice. The mice were found  to be highly sensitive to DNA cross-linking agents; acute exposure to MMC  produced a marked BM hypoplasia and degeneration of proliferative tissues and  caused death within a few days of treatment. However, sequential, nonlethal  doses of MMC caused a progressive decrease in all peripheral blood parameters of  Fac -/- mice. This treatment targeted specifically the BM compartment, with no  effect on other proliferative tissues. The progressive pancytopenia resulted  from a reduction in the number of early and committed hematopoietic progenitors.  These results indicate that the FA genes are involved in the physiologic  response of hematopoietic progenitor cells to DNA damage.', 'Fanconi anemia (FA) is a human disease of bone marrow failure, leukemia,  squamous cell carcinoma, and developmental anomalies, including hypogonadism and  infertility. Bone marrow transplants improve hematopoietic phenotypes but do not  prevent other cancers. FA arises from mutation in any of the 15 FANC genes that  cooperate to repair double stranded DNA breaks by homologous recombination.  Zebrafish has a single ortholog of each human FANC gene and unexpectedly,  mutations in at least two of them (fancl and fancd1(brca2)) lead to  female-to-male sex reversal. Investigations show that, as in human, zebrafish  fanc genes are required for genome stability and for suppressing apoptosis in  tissue culture cells, in embryos treated with DNA damaging agents, and in  meiotic germ cells. The sex reversal phenotype requires the action of Tp53  (p53), an activator of apoptosis. These results suggest that in normal sex  determination, zebrafish oocytes passing through meiosis signal the gonadal soma  to maintain expression of aromatase, an enzyme that converts androgen to  estrogen, thereby feminizing the gonad and the individual. According to this  model, normal male and female zebrafish differ in genetic factors that control  the strength of the late meiotic oocyte-derived signal, probably by regulating  the number of meiotic oocytes, which environmental factors can also alter.  Transcripts from fancd1(brca2) localize at the animal pole of the zebrafish  oocyte cytoplasm and are required for normal oocyte nuclear architecture, for  normal embryonic development, and for preventing ovarian tumors. Embryonic DNA  repair and sex reversal phenotypes provide assays for the screening of small  molecule libraries for therapeutic substances for FA.', 'Fanconi anemia (FA) is an autosomal recessive disorder, characterised by  multiple congenital malformations, bone marrow failure and a predisposition to  developing malignancies, especially leukemia. FA cells show increased levels of  spontaneous chromosomal aberrations and a hypersensitivity to DNA cross-linking  agents such as mitomycin C (MMC) and diepoxybutane (DEB). There are at least  eight complementation groups involved in FA, and the genes for two of these  groups, FA(A) and FA(C), have been isolated and cloned. Mouse models for FA(C)  have been developed by replacing exon 8 or exon 9 of Fac with the neo gene. Mice  homozygous for Fac mutations show reduced fertility and hypersensitivity to  induction of chromosomal aberrations by MMC and DEB. To facilitate the study of  cellular defects in vitro, transformed mouse fibroblast cell lines were  established. Cell-killing experiments and cytogenetic analyses were performed on  these cells following treatment with MMC and DEB. Fac-/- showed significant  hypersensitivity to MMC and DEB as compared with Fac+/+ and +/- for both  cellular phenotypes. This is consistent with results obtained from similar  studies on human fibroblasts and lymphoblastoid cell lines. Therefore, these  isogenic transformed mouse fibroblasts provide as in vitro model for further  investigation of the hypersensitivity of Fanconi anemia cells to DNA  cross-linking agents.', 'A number of DNA repair proteins also play roles in telomere metabolism. To  investigate whether the accelerated telomere shortening reported in Fanconi  anemia (FA) hematopoietic cells relates to a direct role of the FA pathway in  telomere maintenance, we have analyzed telomere dynamics in Fancg-deficient  mouse and human cells. We show here that both hematopoietic (stem and  differentiated bone marrow cells, B and T lymphocytes) and nonhematopoietic  (germ cells, mouse embryonic fibroblasts [MEFs]) Fancg(-/-) mouse cells display  normal telomere length, normal telomerase activity, and normal chromosome  end-capping, even in the presence of extensive clastogen-induced cytogenetic  instability (mitomycin C [MMC], gamma-radiation). In addition,  telomerase-deficient MEFs with humanlike telomere length and decreased Fancg  expression (G5 Terc(-/-)/Fancg shRNA3 MEFs) display normal telomere maintenance.  Finally, early-passage primary fibroblasts from patients with FA of  complementation group G as well as primary human cells with reduced FANCG  expression (FANCG shRNA IMR90 cells) show no signs of telomere dysfunction. Our  observations indicate that accelerated telomere shortening in patients with FA  is not due to a role of FANCG at telomeres but instead may be secondary to the  disease. These findings suggest that telomerase-based therapies could be useful  prophylactic agents in FA aplastic anemia by preserving their telomere reserve  in the context of the disease.', 'Fanconi anemia (FA) is a rare autosomal recessive disease, characterized by bone  marrow failure and cancer predisposition. So far, 8 complementation groups have  been identified, although mutations in FANCA account for the disease in the  majority of FA patients. In this study we characterized the hematopoietic  phenotype of a Fanca knockout mouse model and corrected the main phenotypic  characteristics of the bone marrow (BM) progenitors using retroviral vectors.  The hematopoiesis of these animals was characterized by a modest though  significant thrombocytopenia, consistent with reduced numbers of BM  megakaryocyte progenitors. As observed in other FA models, the hematopoietic  progenitors from Fanca(-/-) mice were highly sensitive to mitomycin C (MMC). In  addition, we observed for the first time in a FA mouse model a marked in vitro  growth defect of Fanca(-/-) progenitors, either when total BM or when purified  Lin(-)Sca-1(+) cells were subjected to in vitro stimulation. Liquid cultures of  Fanca(-/-) BM that were stimulated with stem cell factor plus interleukin-11  produced low numbers of granulocyte macrophage colony-forming units, contained a  high proportion of apoptotic cells, and generated a decreased proportion of  granulocyte versus macrophage cells, compared to normal BM cultures. Aiming to  correct the phenotype of Fanca(-/-) progenitors, purified Lin(-)Sca-1(+) cells  were transduced with retroviral vectors encoding the enhanced green fluorescent  protein (EGFP) gene and human FANCA genes. Lin(-)Sca-1(+) cells from Fanca(-/-)  mice were transduced with an efficiency similar to that of samples from  wild-type mice. More significantly, transductions with FANCA vectors corrected  both the MMC hypersensitivity as well as the impaired ex vivo expansion ability  that characterized the BM progenitors of Fanca(-/-) mice.', 'Fanconi anemia (FA) is a chromosomal instability syndrome characterized by the  presence of pancytopenia, congenital malformations and cancer predisposition.  Six genes associated with this disorder have been cloned, and mice with targeted  disruptions of several of the FA genes have been generated. These mouse models  display the characteristic FA feature of cellular hypersensitivity to DNA  cross-linking agents. Although they do not develop hematological or  developmental abnormalities spontaneously, they mimic FA patients in their  reduced fertility. Studies using these animal models provide valuable insights  into the involvement of apoptotic pathways in FA, and help characterize the  defects in FA hematopoietic cells. In addition, mouse models are also useful for  testing treatments for FA.']]]","Yes, there is a mouse model for Fanconi anemia.

Electronic address: armstros@mskcc.org."", 'Whereas mono-, di- and trimethylation states of lysines on histones typically  have specific functions, no specific functions have been attributed so far to  the different methylation states of histone H3 Lysine 79 (H3K79) generated by  Dot1. Here we show that Dot1, in contrast to other known histone  methyltransferases, introduces multiple methyl groups via a nonprocessive  mechanism. The kinetic mechanism implies that the H3K79 methylation states  cannot be generated independently, suggesting functional redundancy. Indeed,  gene silencing in yeast, which is dependent on Dot1, relied on global H3K79  methylation levels and not on one specific methylation state. Furthermore, our  findings suggest that histone H2B ubiquitination affects H3K79 trimethylation by  enhancing synthesis of all H3K79 methylation states. Our results suggest that  multiple methylation of H3K79 leads to a binary code, which is expected to limit  the possibilities for regulation by putative demethylases or binding proteins.', 'Methylation of Lys79 on histone H3 by Dot1p is important for gene silencing. The  elongated structure of the conserved core of yeast Dot1p contains an N-terminal  helical domain and a seven-stranded catalytic domain that harbors the binding  site for the methyl-donor and an active site pocket sided with conserved  hydrophobic residues. The S-adenosyl-L-homocysteine exhibits an extended  conformation distinct from the folded conformation observed in structures of SET  domain histone lysine methyltransferases. A catalytic asparagine (Asn479),  located at the bottom of the active site pocket, suggests a mechanism similar to  that employed for amino methylation in DNA and protein glutamine methylation.  The acidic, concave cleft between the two domains contains two basic residue  binding pockets that could accommodate the outwardly protruding basic side  chains around Lys79 of histone H3 on the disk-like nucleosome surface.  Biochemical studies suggest that recombinant Dot1 proteins are active on  recombinant nucleosomes, free of any modifications.', 'Methylation of H3K79 is associated with chromatin at expressed genes, though it  is unclear if this histone modification is required for transcription of all  genes. Recent studies suggest that Wnt-responsive genes depend particularly on  H3K79 methylation, which is catalyzed by the methyltransferase DOT1L. Human  leukemias carrying MLL gene rearrangements show DOT1L-mediated H3K79 methylation  and aberrant expression of leukemogenic genes. DOT1L inhibitors reverse these  effects, but their clinical use is potentially limited by toxicity in  Wnt-dependent tissues such as intestinal epithelium. Genome-wide positioning of  the H3K79me2 mark in Lgr5(+) mouse intestinal stem cells and mature intestinal  villus epithelium correlated with expression levels of all transcripts and not  with Wnt-responsive genes per se. Selective Dot1l disruption in Lgr5(+) stem  cells or in whole intestinal epithelium eliminated H3K79me2 from the respective  compartments, allowing genetic evaluation of DOT1L requirements. The absence of  methylated H3K79 did not impair health, intestinal homeostasis, or expression of  Wnt target genes in crypt epithelium for up to 4 months, despite increased crypt  cell apoptosis. Global transcript profiles in Dot1l-null cells were barely  altered. Thus, H3K79 methylation is not essential for transcription of  Wnt-responsive or other intestinal genes, and intestinal toxicity is not  imperative when DOT1L is rendered inactive in vivo.', 'In both mammalian and Drosophila spermatids, the completely histone-based  chromatin structure is reorganized to a largely protamine-based structure.  During this histone-to-protamine switch, transition proteins are expressed, for  example TNP1 and TNP2 in mammals and Tpl94D in Drosophila. Recently, we  demonstrated that in Drosophila spermatids, H3K79 methylation accompanies  histone H4 hyperacetylation during chromatin reorganization. Preceding the  histone-to-protamine transition, the H3K79 methyltransferase Grappa is  expressed, and the predominant isoform bears a C-terminal extension. Here, we  show that isoforms of the Grappa-equivalent protein in humans, rats and mice,  that is DOT1L, have a C-terminal extension. In mice, the transcript of this  isoform was enriched in the post-meiotic stages of spermatogenesis. In human and  mice spermatids, di- and tri-methylated H3K79 temporally overlapped with  hyperacetylated H4 and thus accompanied chromatin reorganization. In rat  spermatids, trimethylated H3K79 directly preceded transition protein loading on  chromatin. We analysed the impact of bacterial infections on spermatid chromatin  using a uropathogenic Escherichia coli-elicited epididymo-orchitis rat model and  showed that these infections caused aberrant spermatid chromatin. Bacterial  infections led to premature emergence of trimethylated H3K79 and hyperacetylated  H4. Trimethylated H3K79 and hyperacetylated H4 simultaneously occurred with  transition protein TNP1, which was never observed in spermatids of mock-infected  rats. Upon bacterial infection, only histone-based spermatid chromatin showed  abnormalities, whereas protamine-compacted chromatin seemed to be unaffected.  Our results indicated that H3K79 methylation is a histone modification conserved  in Drosophila, mouse, rat and human spermatids and may be a prerequisite for  proper chromatin reorganization.', 'Residue and degree-specific methylation of histone lysines along with other  epigenetic modifications organizes chromatin into distinct domains and regulates  almost every aspect of DNA metabolism. Identification of histone  methyltransferases and demethylases, as well as proteins that recognize  methylated lysines, has clarified the role of each methylation event in  regulating different biological pathways. Methylation of histone H4 lysine 20  (H4K20me) plays critical roles in diverse cellular processes such as gene  expression, cell cycle progression and DNA damage repair, with each of the three  degrees of methylation (mono-, di- and tri-methylation) making a unique  contribution. Here we discuss recent studies of H4K20me that have greatly  improved our understanding of the regulation and function of this fascinating  histone modification.', 'BACKGROUND: DNA methylation, histone modifications and nucleosome occupancy act  in concert for regulation of gene expression patterns in mammalian cells.  Recently, G9a, a H3K9 methyltransferase, has been shown to play a role in  establishment of DNA methylation at embryonic gene targets in ES cells through  recruitment of de novo DNMT3A/3B enzymes. However, whether G9a plays a similar  role in maintenance of DNA methylation in somatic cells is still unclear. RESULTS: Here we show that G9a is not essential for maintenance of DNA  methylation in somatic cells. Knockdown of G9a has no measurable effect on DNA  methylation levels at G9a-target loci. DNMT3A/3B remain stably anchored to  nucleosomes containing methylated DNA even in the absence of G9a, ensuring  faithful propagation of methylated states in cooperation with DNMT1 through  somatic divisions. Moreover, G9a also associates with nucleosomes in a DNMT3A/3B  and DNA methylation-independent manner. However, G9a knockdown synergizes with  pharmacologic inhibition of DNMTs resulting in increased hypomethylation and  inhibition of cell proliferation. CONCLUSIONS: Taken together, these data suggest that G9a is not involved in  maintenance of DNA methylation in somatic cells but might play a role in  re-initiation of de novo methylation after treatment with hypomethylating drugs,  thus serving as a potential target for combinatorial treatments strategies  involving DNMTs inhibitors.', 'During spermiogenesis, haploid spermatids undergo extensive chromatin remodeling  events in which histones are successively replaced by more basic protamines to  generate highly compacted chromatin. Here we show for the first time that H3K79  methylation is a conserved feature preceding the histone-to-protamine transition  in Drosophila melanogaster and rat. During Drosophila spermatogenesis, the  Dot1-like methyltransferase Grappa (Gpp) is primarily expressed in canoe stage  nuclei. The corresponding H3K79 methylation is a histone modification that  precedes the histone-to-protamine transition and correlates with histone H4  hyperacetylation. When acetylation was inhibited in cultured Drosophila testes,  nuclei were smaller and chromatin was compact, Gpp was little synthesized, H3K79  methylation was strongly reduced, and protamines were not synthesized. The Gpp  isoform Gpp-D has a unique C-terminus, and Gpp is essential for full fertility.  In rat, H3K79 methylation also correlates with H4 hyperacetylation but not with  active RNA polymerase II, which might point towards a conserved function in  chromatin remodeling during the histone-to-protamine transition in both  Drosophila and rat.', 'Tri-methylation of histone H3 lysine 9 is important for recruiting  heterochromatin protein 1 (HP1) to discrete regions of the genome, thereby  regulating gene expression, chromatin packaging and heterochromatin formation.  Here we show that HP1alpha, -beta, and -gamma are released from chromatin during  the M phase of the cell cycle, even though tri-methylation levels of histone H3  lysine 9 remain unchanged. However, the additional, transient modification of  histone H3 by phosphorylation of serine 10 next to the more stable methyl-lysine  9 mark is sufficient to eject HP1 proteins from their binding sites. Inhibition  or depletion of the mitotic kinase Aurora B, which phosphorylates serine 10 on  histone H3, causes retention of HP1 proteins on mitotic chromosomes, suggesting  that H3 serine 10 phosphorylation is necessary for the dissociation of HP1 from  chromatin in M phase. These findings establish a regulatory mechanism of  protein-protein interactions, through a combinatorial readout of two adjacent  post-translational modifications: a stable methylation and a dynamic  phosphorylation mark.', 'We created a mouse model wherein conditional expression of an Mll-AF4 fusion  oncogene induces B precursor acute lymphoblastic (ALL) or acute myeloid  leukemias (AML). Gene expression profile analysis of the ALL cells demonstrated  significant overlap with human MLL-rearranged ALL. ChIP-chip analysis  demonstrated histone H3 lysine 79 (H3K79) methylation profiles that correlated  with Mll-AF4-associated gene expression profiles in murine ALLs and in human  MLL-rearranged leukemias. Human MLL-rearranged ALLs could be distinguished from  other ALLs by their H3K79 profiles, and suppression of the H3K79  methyltransferase DOT1L inhibited expression of critical MLL-AF4 target genes.  We thus demonstrate that ectopic H3K79 methylation is a distinguishing feature  of murine and human MLL-AF4 ALLs and is important for maintenance of  MLL-AF4-driven gene expression.']]]","The general function of H3K79 methylation appears to be crucial for gene silencing and chromatin remodeling, particularly during processes like differentiation and development. It seems to play a role in maintaining gene expression patterns and regulating DNA metabolism. Additionally, H3K79 methylation is associated with chromatin reorganization during transitions like the histone-to-protamine switch in sperm cells and can influence gene expression in response to certain stimuli or diseases.","[{'Exact': array([-1.66441208, 15.26071637,  5.14813922, 10.51301193, 38.25806545,

Which transcription factors are involved in E-cadherin repression during EMT?,"[[['Epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT) is a complex process in which epithelial  cells acquire the characteristics of invasive mesenchymal cells. EMT has been  implicated in cancer progression and metastasis as well as the formation of many  tissues and organs during development. Epithelial cells undergoing EMT lose  cell-cell adhesion structures and polarity, and rearrange their cytoskeletons.  Several oncogenic pathways such as transforming growth factor (TGF) -β, Wnt, and  Notch signaling pathways, have been shown to induce EMT. These pathways have  activated transcription factors including Snail, Slug, and the ZEB family which  work as transcriptional repressors of E-cadherin, thereby making epithelial  cells motile and resistant to apoptosis. Mounting evidence shows that EMT is  associated with cell invasion and tumor progression.In this review, we summarize  the characteristic features of EMT, pathways leading to EMT, and the role of EMT  in cell invasion. Three topics are addressed in this review: (1) Definition of  EMT, (2) Signaling pathways leading to EMT, (3) Role of EMT in cell invasion.  Understanding the role of EMT in cell invasion will provide valuable information  for establishing strategies to develop anti-metastatic therapeutics which  modulate malignant cellular processes mediated by EMT.', 'OBJECTIVE: Pancreatic cancer is characterised by invasive tumour spread and  early metastasis formation. During epithelial-mesenchymal transition, loss of  the cell adhesion molecule E-cadherin is frequent and can be caused by genetic  or epigenetic modifications, recruitment of transcriptional  activators/repressors or post-translational modifications. A study was  undertaken to investigate how E-cadherin expression in human pancreatic  adenocarcinoma and pancreatic cancer cell lines is regulated. METHODS: In 25 human pancreatic cancer resection specimens, the coding region of  the E-cadherin gene (CDH1) was sequenced for somatic mutations. The tumour  samples and 11 established human pancreatic cancer cell lines were analysed by  immunohistochemistry, western blot analysis, chromatin immunoprecipitation and  methylation-specific PCR. The role of specific histone deacetylase inhibitors  (HDACi) on pancreatic tumour cell migration and proliferation was studied in  vitro. RESULTS: Neither somatic mutations nor CDH1 promoter hypermethylation were found  to be responsible for downregulation of E-cadherin in pancreatic cancer. In the  transcriptionally active CDH1 promoter, acetylation of histones H3 and H4 was  detected whereas HDAC1 and HDAC2 were found attached only to a silent promoter.  Expression of ZEB1, a transcription factor known to recruit HDACs, was seen in  E-cadherin-deficient cell lines in which ZEB1/HDAC complexes were found attached  to the CDH1 promoter. Moreover, knockdown of ZEB1 prevented HDAC from binding to  the CDH1 promoter, resulting in histone acetylation and expression of  E-cadherin. HDACi treatment attenuated tumour cell migration and proliferation. CONCLUSIONS: These findings imply an important role for histone deacetylation in  the downregulation of E-cadherin in human pancreatic cancer. Recruitment of  HDACs to the CDH1 promoter is regulated by the transcription factor ZEB1, and  inhibition of HDACs may be a promising antitumour therapy for pancreatic cancer.', 'Endometrial carcinoma (EC) is the most frequent among infiltrating tumors of the  female genital tract, with myometrial invasion representing an increase in the  rate of recurrences and a decrease in survival. We have previously described  ETV5 transcription factor associated with myometrial infiltration in human ECs.  In this work, we further investigated ETV5 orchestrating downstream effects to  confer the tumor the invasive capabilities needed to disseminate in the early  stages of EC dissemination. Molecular profiling evidenced ETV5 having a direct  role on epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition (EMT). In particular, ETV5  modulated Zeb1 expression and E-Cadherin repression leading to a complete  reorganization of cell-cell and cell-substrate contacts. ETV5-promoted EMT  resulted in the acquisition of migratory and invasive capabilities in  endometrial cell lines. Furthermore, we identified the lipoma-preferred partner  protein as a regulatory partner of ETV5, acting as a sensor for extracellular  signals promoting tumor invasion. All together, we propose ETV5-transcriptional  regulation of the EMT process through a crosstalk with the tumor surrounding  microenvironment, as a principal event initiating EC invasion.', 'Breast tumor interleukin-6 (IL-6) levels increase with tumor grade, and elevated  serum IL-6 correlates with poor breast cancer patient survival.  Epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT) phenotypes such as impaired E-cadherin  expression or aberrant Vimentin induction are associated with enhanced  metastasis and unfavorable clinical outcome in breast cancer. Despite this fact,  few tumor microenvironment-derived extracellular signaling factors capable of  provoking such a phenotypic transition have been identified. In this study, we  showed that IL-6 promoted E-cadherin repression among a panel of estrogen  receptor-alpha-positive human breast cancer cells. Furthermore, ectopic stable  IL-6 expressing MCF-7 breast adenocarcinoma cells (MCF-7(IL-6)) exhibited an EMT  phenotype characterized by impaired E-cadherin expression and induction of  Vimentin, N-cadherin, Snail and Twist. MCF-7(IL-6) cells formed xenograft tumors  that displayed loss of E-cadherin, robust Vimentin induction, increased  proliferative indices, advanced tumor grade and undifferentiated histology.  Finally, we showed aberrant IL-6 production and STAT3 activation in MCF-7 cells  that constitutively express Twist, a metastatic regulator and direct  transcriptional repressor of E-cadherin. To our knowledge, this is the first  study that shows IL-6 as an inducer of an EMT phenotype in breast cancer cells  and implicates its potential to promote breast cancer metastasis.', 'The epithelium to mesenchyme transition is thought to play a fundamental role  during embryonic development and tumor progression. Loss of cell-cell adhesion  and modification of both cell morphology and gene expression are the main events  associated with this transition. There is a large amount of evidence suggesting  that growth factors can initiate these events. Yet, the connection from growth  factor induction to changes in cell adhesion and morphology is largely unknown.  To elucidate this connection, we have investigated the action of IGF-II on  E-cadherin/beta-catenin complex-mediated cell-cell adhesion and on  beta-catenin/TCF-3 mediated gene expression. We can show that (1) IGF-II induces  a rapid epithelium to mesenchymal transition; (2) IGF1R, the receptor for  IGF-II, belongs to the same membrane complex as E-cadherin and beta-catenin; (3)  IGF-II induces a redistribution of beta-catenin from the plasma membrane to the  nucleus and an intracellular sequestration and degradation of E-cadherin; (4)  IGF-II induces the transcription of beta-catenin/TCF-3 target genes. Based on  the given case of IGF-II and E-cadherin/beta-catenin complex, this study reveals  the backbone of a cascade connecting growth factor signaling with cell-cell  adhesion during EMT.', 'Expression of E-cadherin, a hallmark of epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT),  is often lost due to promoter DNA methylation in basal-like breast cancer  (BLBC), which contributes to the metastatic advantage of this disease; however,  the underlying mechanism remains unclear. Here, we identified that Snail  interacted with Suv39H1 (suppressor of variegation 3-9 homolog 1), a major  methyltransferase responsible for H3K9me3 that intimately links to DNA  methylation. We demonstrated that the SNAG domain of Snail and the SET domain of  Suv39H1 were required for their mutual interactions. We found that H3K9me3 and  DNA methylation on the E-cadherin promoter were higher in BLBC cell lines. We  showed that Snail interacted with Suv39H1 and recruited it to the E-cadherin  promoter for transcriptional repression. Knockdown of Suv39H1 restored  E-cadherin expression by blocking H3K9me3 and DNA methylation and resulted in  the inhibition of cell migration, invasion and metastasis of BLBC. Our study not  only reveals a critical mechanism underlying the epigenetic regulation of EMT,  but also paves a way for the development of new treatment strategies against  this disease.', 'Epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT), a crucial event in cancer progression  and embryonic development, is induced by transforming growth factor (TGF)-beta  in mouse mammary NMuMG epithelial cells. Id proteins have previously been  reported to inhibit major features of TGF-beta-induced EMT. In this study, we  show that expression of the deltaEF1 family proteins, deltaEF1 (ZEB1) and SIP1,  is gradually increased by TGF-beta with expression profiles reciprocal to that  of E-cadherin. SIP1 and deltaEF1 each dramatically down-regulated the  transcription of E-cadherin in NMuMG cells through direct binding to the  E-cadherin promoter. Silencing of the expression of both SIP1 and deltaEF1, but  not either alone, completely abolished TGF-beta-induced E-cadherin repression.  However, expression of mesenchymal markers, including fibronectin, N-cadherin,  and vimentin, was not affected by knockdown of SIP1 and deltaEF1.  TGF-beta-induced the expression of Ets1, which in turn activated deltaEF1  promoter activity. Moreover, up-regulation of SIP1 and deltaEF1 expression by  TGF-beta was suppressed by knockdown of Ets1 expression. In addition, Id2  suppressed the TGF-beta- and Ets1-induced up-regulation of deltaEF1. Taken  together, these findings suggest that the deltaEF1 family proteins, SIP1 and  deltaEF1, are necessary, but not sufficient, for TGF-beta-induced EMT and that  Ets1 induced by TGF-beta may function as an upstream transcriptional regulator  of SIP1 and deltaEF1.', 'Breast cancers are highly heterogeneous but can be grouped into subtypes based  on several criteria, including level of expression of certain markers.  Claudin-low breast cancer (CLBC) is associated with early metastasis and  resistance to chemotherapy, while gene profiling indicates it is characterized  by the expression of markers of epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT) - a  phenotypic conversion linked with metastasis. Although the epigenetic program  controlling the phenotypic and cellular plasticity of EMT remains unclear, one  contributor may be methylation of the E-cadherin promoter, resulting in  decreased E-cadherin expression, a hallmark of EMT. Indeed, reduced E-cadherin  often occurs in CLBC and may contribute to the early metastasis and poor patient  survival associated with this disease. Here, we have determined that methylation  of histone H3 on lysine 9 (H3K9me2) is critical for promoter DNA methylation of  E-cadherin in three TGF-β-induced EMT model cell lines, as well as in CLBC cell  lines. Further, Snail interacted with G9a, a major euchromatin methyltransferase  responsible for H3K9me2, and recruited G9a and DNA methyltransferases to the  E-cadherin promoter for DNA methylation. Knockdown of G9a restored E-cadherin  expression by suppressing H3K9me2 and blocking DNA methylation. This resulted in  inhibition of cell migration and invasion in vitro and suppression of tumor  growth and lung colonization in in vivo models of CLBC metastasis. Our study not  only reveals a critical mechanism underlying the epigenetic regulation of EMT  but also paves a way for the development of new treatment strategies for CLBC.', 'Epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT), a biological process by which polarized  epithelial cells convert into a mesenchymal phenotype, has been implicated to  contribute to the molecular heterogeneity of epithelial ovarian cancer (EOC).  Here we report that a transcription factor--Grainyhead-like 2 (GRHL2) maintains  the epithelial phenotype. EOC tumours with lower GRHL2 levels are associated  with the Mes/Mesenchymal molecular subtype and a poorer overall survival.  shRNA-mediated knockdown of GRHL2 in EOC cells with an epithelial phenotype  results in EMT changes, with increased cell migration, invasion and motility. By  ChIP-sequencing and gene expression microarray, microRNA-200b/a is identified as  the direct transcriptional target of GRHL2 and regulates the epithelial status  of EOC through ZEB1 and E-cadherin. Our study demonstrates that loss of GRHL2  increases the levels of histone mark H3K27me3 on promoters and GRHL2-binding  sites at miR-200b/a and E-cadherin genes. These findings support GRHL2 as a  pivotal gatekeeper of EMT in EOC via miR-200-ZEB1.', 'Endometrial carcinoma (EC) is the most frequent among infiltrating tumors of the  female genital tract, with myometrial invasion representing an increase in the  rate of recurrences and a decrease in survival.

Which gene has been implicated in Majeed Syndrome?,"[[['BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVE: Majeed syndrome is an autosomal recessive disorder  characterised by the triad of chronic recurrent multifocal osteomyelitis,  congenital dyserythropoietic anaemia and a neutrophilic dermatosis that is  caused by mutations in LPIN2. Long-term outcome is poor. This is the first  report detailing the treatment of Majeed syndrome with biological agents and  demonstrates clinical improvement with IL-1blockade. METHODS: We describe the clinical presentation, genetic analysis, cytokine  profiles and response to biological therapy in two brothers with Majeed  syndrome. RESULTS: Both boys were homozygous for a novel 2-base pair deletion in LPIN2  (c.1312_1313delCT; p.Leu438fs+16X), confirming the diagnosis. Their bone disease  and anaemia were refractory to treatment with corticosteroids. Both siblings had  elevated proinflammatory cytokines in their serum, including tumour necrosis  factor α (TNF-α), however a trial of the TNF inhibitor etanercept resulted in no  improvement. IL-1 inhibition with either a recombinant IL-1 receptor antagonist  (anakinra) or an anti-IL-1β antibody (canakinumab) resulted in dramatic clinical  and laboratory improvement. CONCLUSIONS: The differential response to treatment with TNF-α or IL-1 blocking  agents sheds light into disease pathogenesis; it supports the hypothesis that  Majeed syndrome is an IL-1β dependent autoinflammatory disorder, and further  underscores the importance of IL-1 in sterile bone inflammation.', 'The mechanism of profound generalized iduronate sulfatase (IDS) deficiency in a  developmentally delayed female with clinical Hunter syndrome was studied.  Methylation-sensitive RFLP analysis of DNA from peripheral blood lymphocytes  from the patient, using MspI/HpaII digestion and probing with M27 beta, showed  that the paternal allele was resistant to HpaII digestion (i.e., was methylated)  while the maternal allele was digested (i.e., was hypomethylated), indicating  marked imbalance of X-chromosome inactivation in peripheral blood lymphocytes of  the patient. Similar studies on DNA from maternal lymphocytes showed random  X-chromosome inactivation. Among a total of 40 independent maternal fibroblast  clones isolated by dilution plating and analyzed for IDS activity, no IDS- clone  was found. Somatic cell hybrid clones containing at least one active human X  chromosome were produced by fusion of patient fibroblasts with Hprt- hamster  fibroblasts (RJK88) and grown in HAT-ouabain medium. Methylation-sensitive RFLP  analysis of DNA from the hybrids showed that of the 22 clones that retained the  DXS255 locus (M27 beta), all contained the paternal allele in the methylated  (active) form. No clone was isolated containing only the maternal X chromosome,  and in no case was the maternal allele hypermethylated. We postulate from these  studies that the patient has MPS II as a result of a mutation resulting in both  the disruption of the IDS locus on her paternal X chromosome and unbalanced  inactivation of the nonmutant maternal X chromosome.', ""OBJECTIVE: Monogenic autoinflammatory diseases are disorders of Mendelian  inheritance that are characterized by mutations in genes that regulate innate  immunity and whose typical features are systemic inflammation without high-titer  autoantibodies or antigen-specific T cells. Skin and bone inflammation in the  newborn period have been described in 3 of these autoinflammatory disorders:  neonatal-onset multisystem inflammatory disease, Majeed syndrome, and deficiency  of interleukin-1 (IL-1) receptor antagonist (DIRA) syndrome. This study was  undertaken to present the characteristics of the DIRA syndrome in 2 cases from  Brazil, and describe a novel mutation in IL1RN. METHODS: Two unrelated Brazilian patients were evaluated for the clinical signs  and symptoms of these 3 disorders, and peripheral blood samples were assessed  for mutations in NLRP3, LPIN2, and IL1RN by DNA resequencing analysis. A  mutation in IL1RN that encodes a mutant protein was identified, and the  expression and function of this mutant protein were compared to those of the  wild-type protein. RESULTS: Both patients presented with pustular dermatitis resembling generalized  pustular psoriasis, recurrent multifocal aseptic osteomyelitis, and elevation in  the levels of acute-phase reactants, all of which are features most consistent  with the DIRA syndrome. Chronic lung disease was observed in 1 of the patients,  and jugular venous thrombosis was observed in the other patient. Both patients  showed a partial response to corticosteroid therapy, and 1 patient experienced  an initial improvement of dermatitis with the use of acitretin. Both patients  were homozygous for a novel 15-bp (in-frame) deletion on the IL1RN gene. The  mutated protein expressed in vitro had no affinity with the IL-1 receptor, and  stimulation of the patients' cells with recombinant human IL-1α or IL-1β led to  oversecretion of proinflammatory cytokines, similar to the findings obtained in  previously reported patients. CONCLUSION: The presence of the same homozygous novel mutation in IL1RN in 2  unrelated Brazilian patients suggests that this genetic variant may be a founder  mutation that has been introduced in the Brazilian population."", 'The three lipin phosphatidate phosphatase (PAP) enzymes catalyze a step in  glycerolipid biosynthesis, the conversion of phosphatidate to diacylglycerol.  Lipin-1 is critical for lipid synthesis and homeostasis in adipose tissue,  liver, muscle, and peripheral nerves. Little is known about the physiological  role of lipin-2, the predominant lipin protein present in liver and the  deficient gene product in the rare disorder Majeed syndrome. By using  lipin-2-deficient mice, we uncovered a functional relationship between lipin-1  and lipin-2 that operates in a tissue-specific and age-dependent manner. In  liver, lipin-2 deficiency led to a compensatory increase in hepatic lipin-1  protein and elevated PAP activity, which maintained lipid homeostasis under  basal conditions, but led to diet-induced hepatic triglyceride accumulation. As  lipin-2-deficient mice aged, they developed ataxia and impaired balance. This  was associated with the combination of lipin-2 deficiency and an age-dependent  reduction in cerebellar lipin-1 levels, resulting in altered cerebellar  phospholipid composition. Similar to patients with Majeed syndrome,  lipin-2-deficient mice developed anemia, but did not show evidence of  osteomyelitis, suggesting that additional environmental or genetic components  contribute to the bone abnormalities observed in patients. Combined lipin-1 and  lipin-2 deficiency caused embryonic lethality. Our results reveal functional  interactions between members of the lipin family in vivo, and a unique role for  lipin-2 in central nervous system biology that may be particularly important  with advancing age. Additionally, as has been observed in mice and humans with  lipin-1 deficiency, the pathophysiology in lipin-2 deficiency is associated with  dysregulation of lipid intermediates.', 'McKusick-Kaufman syndrome comprises hydrometrocolpos, polydactyly, and  congenital heart defects and overlaps with Bardet-Biedl syndrome, comprising  retinitis pigmentosa, polydactyly, obesity, mental retardation, and renal and  genital anomalies. Bardet-Biedl syndrome is genetically heterogeneous with three  cloned genes ( BBS2, BBS4, and MKKS) and at least three other known loci ( BBS1,  BBS3, and BBS5). Both McKusick-Kaufman syndrome and Bardet-Biedl syndrome are  inherited in an autosomal recessive pattern, and both syndromes are caused by  mutations in the MKKS gene. However, mutations in MKKS are found in only 4%-11%  of unselected Bardet-Biedl syndrome patients. We hypothesized that an analysis  of patients with atypical Bardet-Biedl syndrome and McKusick-Kaufman syndrome  (Group I; 15 probands) and patients with Bardet-Biedl syndrome who had linkage  results inconsistent with linkage to the other loci (Group II; 12 probands)  could increase the MKKS mutation yield. Both mutant alleles were identified in  only two families in Group II. Single (heterozygous) sequence variations were  found in three Group I families and in two Group II families. Combining these  results with previously published data showed that only one mutant allele was  detected in nearly half of all patients screened to date, suggesting that  unusual mutational mechanisms or patterns of inheritance may be involved.  However, sequencing of the BBS2 gene in these patients did not provide any  evidence of digenic or ""triallelic"" inheritance. The frequency of detected  mutations in MKKS in Group II patients was 24%, i.e., six times higher than the  published rate for unselected BBS patients, suggesting that small-scale linkage  analyses may be useful in suitable families.', 'Two consanguineous Qatari siblings presented for evaluation: a 17-4/12-year-old  male with hypogonadotropic hypogonadism, alopecia, intellectual disability, and  microcephaly and his 19-year-old sister with primary amenorrhea, alopecia, and  normal cognition. Both required hormone treatment to produce secondary sex  characteristics and pubertal development beyond Tanner 1. SNP array analysis of  both probands was performed to detect shared regions of homozygosity which may  harbor homozygous mutations in a gene causing their common features of abnormal  pubertal development, alopecia, and variable cognitive delay. Our patients  shared multiple homozygous genomic regions; ten shared regions were >1\u2009Mb in  length and constituted 0.99% of the genome. DCAF17, encoding a transmembrane  nuclear protein of uncertain function, was the only gene identified in a  homozygous region known to cause hypogonadotropic hypogonadism. DCAF17 mutations  are associated with Woodhouse-Sakati syndrome, a rare disorder characterized by  alopecia, hypogonadotropic hypogonadism, sensorineural hearing loss, diabetes  mellitus, and extrapyramidal movements. Sequencing of the coding exons and  flanking intronic regions of DCAF17 in the proband revealed homozygosity for a  previously described founder mutation (c.436delC). Targeted DCAF17 sequencing of  his affected sibling revealed the same homozygous mutation. This family  illustrates the utility of SNP array testing in consanguineous families to  efficiently and inexpensively identify regions of genomic homozygosity in which  genetic candidates for recessive conditions can be identified.', 'Meckel syndrome (MKS) is an embryonic lethal, autosomal recessive disorder  characterized by polycystic kidney disease, central nervous system defects,  polydactyly and liver fibrosis. This disorder is thought to be associated with  defects in primary cilia; therefore, it is classed as a ciliopathy. To date, six  genes have been commonly associated with MKS (MKS1, TMEM67, TMEM216, CEP290,  CC2D2A and RPGRIP1L). However, mutation screening of these genes revealed two  mutated alleles in only just over half of our MKS cohort (46 families),  suggesting an even greater level of genetic heterogeneity. To explore the full  genetic complexity of MKS, we performed exon-enriched next-generation sequencing  of 31 ciliopathy genes in 12 MKS pedigrees using RainDance microdroplet-PCR  enrichment and IlluminaGAIIx next-generation sequencing. In family M456, we  detected a splice-donor site change in a novel MKS gene, B9D1. The B9D1 protein  is structurally similar to MKS1 and has been shown to be of importance for  ciliogenesis in Caenorhabditis elegans. Reverse transcriptase-PCR analysis of  fetal RNA revealed, hemizygously, a single smaller mRNA product with a  frameshifting exclusion of B9D1 exon 4. ArrayCGH showed that the second mutation  was a 1.713 Mb de novo deletion completely deleting the B9D1 allele.  Immunofluorescence analysis highlighted a significantly lower level of ciliated  patient cells compared to controls, confirming a role for B9D1 in ciliogenesis.  The fetus inherited an additional likely pathogenic novel missense change to a  second MKS gene, CEP290; p.R2210C, suggesting oligogenic inheritance in this  disorder.', 'Lipin 2 is a phosphatidic acid phosphatase (PAP) responsible for the penultimate  step of triglyceride synthesis and dephosphorylation of phosphatidic acid (PA)  to generate diacylglycerol. The lipin family of PA phosphatases is composed of  lipins 1-3, which are members of the conserved haloacid dehalogenase  superfamily. Although genetic alteration of LPIN2 in humans is known to cause  Majeed syndrome, little is known about the biochemical regulation of its PAP  activity. Here, in an attempt to gain a better general understanding of the  biochemical nature of lipin 2, we have performed kinetic and phosphorylation  analyses. We provide evidence that lipin 2, like lipin 1, binds PA via the  electrostatic hydrogen bond switch mechanism but has a lower rate of catalysis.  Like lipin 1, lipin 2 is highly phosphorylated, and we identified 15  phosphosites. However, unlike lipin 1, the phosphorylation of lipin 2 is not  induced by insulin signaling nor is it sensitive to inhibition of the mammalian  target of rapamycin. Importantly, phosphorylation of lipin 2 does not negatively  regulate either membrane binding or PAP activity. This suggests that lipin 2  functions as a constitutively active PA phosphatase in stark contrast to the  high degree of phosphorylation-mediated regulation of lipin 1. This knowledge of  lipin 2 regulation is important for a deeper understanding of how the lipin  family functions with respect to lipid synthesis and, more generally, as an  example of how the membrane environment around PA can influence its effector  proteins.', 'PURPOSE OF REVIEW: The family of three lipin proteins act as phosphatidate  phosphatase (PAP) enzymes required for glycerolipid biosynthesis, and also as  transcriptional coactivators that regulate expression of lipid metabolism genes.  The genes for lipin-1, lipin-2 and lipin-3 are expressed in key metabolic  tissues, including adipose tissue, skeletal muscle and liver, but the  physiological functions of each member of the family have not been fully  elucidated. Here we examine the most recent studies that provide information  about the roles of lipin proteins in metabolism and human disease. RECENT FINDINGS: Recent studies have identified mutations that cause lipin-1 or  lipin-2 deficiency in humans, leading to acute myoglobinuria in childhood or the  inflammatory disorder Majeed syndrome, respectively. The effects of lipin-1  deficiency appear to include both the loss of glycerolipid building blocks and  the accumulation of lipid intermediates that disrupt cellular function. Several  studies have demonstrated that polymorphisms in the LPIN1 and LPIN2 genes are  associated with metabolic disease traits, including insulin sensitivity,  diabetes, blood pressure and response to thiazolidinedione drugs. Furthermore,  lipin-1 expression levels in adipose tissue and/or liver are positively  correlated with insulin sensitivity. Studies of lipin-1 in adipocytes have shed  some light on its relationship with insulin sensitivity. SUMMARY: Lipin-1 and lipin-2 are required for normal lipid homeostasis and have  unique physiological roles. Future studies, for example using engineered mouse  models, will be required to fully elucidate their specific roles in normal  physiology and disease.', 'STUDY DESIGN: A single large family, in which adolescent idiopathic scoliosis  (AIS) and pectus excavatum (PE) segregate as an autosomal dominant condition,  was evaluated. Genome-wide linkage analysis and candidate gene sequencing were  performed. OBJECTIVE: To map the disease-causing locus in a large white family in which AIS  and PE cosegregate. SUMMARY OF BACKGROUND DATA: AIS and PE are common musculoskeletal conditions  known to have a genetic component, though few genes have been identified for  either. Genetic studies have been confounded by a lack of large families in  which the disorders segregate. METHODS: Clinical examinations were performed on the proband, who underwent  posterior spinal fusion, and 12 additional affected family members. To map a  gene causing AIS and PE, a genome-wide linkage analysis was performed with the  Affymetrix Mapping 10 K XbaI array on 13 affected and 10 unaffected family  members. Candidate genes were sequenced. RESULTS: AIS was present in 13 female family members and PE was present in 3  males and 1 female. Genome-wide linkage analysis resulted in a linkage peak on  chromosome 18 q with a maximum parametric multipoint logarithm of the odds score  of 3.86. Recombinants delineated the critical genetic region to an interval of  6.4 cM between SNP_A-1519369 and SNP_A-1507702, corresponding to a 7.06-Mb  region (hg18: chr18:26342508-34395660). The chromosome 18 q linkage region  contains more than 30 genes. Resequencing of the coding regions of 21 candidate  genes in the region did not reveal any causative mutation. CONCLUSION: Linkage analysis in this large family demonstrated a novel locus for  AIS and PE on chromosome 18 q. Because of the increased frequency of PE in  family members of AIS patients, consideration of family members with PE as  affected may increase the power of AIS genetic linkage studies.']]]",LPIN2,"[{'Exact': array([12.59990833,  0.99510899,  3.35878114,  1.7872457 ,  0.62449327,

What is targeted by Palbociclib?,"[[['PURPOSE: This study aimed to determine a maximum tolerated dose (MTD) and  recommended dose for disease-directed studies of necitumumab (IMC-11F8), a fully  human IgG(1) monoclonal antibody directed at the epidermal growth factor  receptor, and to characterize the safety profile, pharmacokinetics, preliminary  antitumor activity, and immunogenicity of necitumumab. EXPERIMENTAL DESIGN: Patients with advanced solid malignancies were treated with  100 to 1,000 mg (flat dosing) necitumumab followed by a 2-week pharmacokinetics  sampling period, before beginning 6-week cycles of therapy. RESULTS: Sixty patients received necitumumab weekly (29 patients) or every other  week (31 patients). Two patients receiving 1,000 mg every 2 weeks experienced  dose-limiting toxicities (DLT; grade 3 headache), accompanied by grade 3 nausea  and vomiting in one patient. Occurring hours after the initial dose, these DLTs  established 800 mg as the MTD. Mild dose-related skin toxicity was the most  common drug-related toxicity (80%). One patient in each arm experienced grade 3  acneform rash, which responded to oral antibiotics and topical therapy. Toxicity  was similar on both schedules. Necitumumab exhibited saturable elimination and  nonlinear pharmacokinetics. At 800 mg (both arms), its half-life was  approximately 7 days. All patients treated with >or=600 mg necitumumab achieved  target trough concentrations (>or=40 microg/mL). Antibodies against necitumumab  were not detected. Partial response and stable disease were experienced by 2 and  16 patients, respectively. CONCLUSION: Well tolerated, necitumumab is associated with preliminary evidence  of antitumor activity, and achieves biologically relevant concentrations  throughout the dosing period. The recommended dose of necitumumab for further  clinical development is 800 mg (flat dose) weekly or every 2 weeks based on the  clinical setting.', 'Cyclins and cyclin-dependent protein kinases (CDKs) are important regulatory  components that are required for cell cycle progression. The levels of the cell  cycle CDKs are generally constant and their activities are controlled by  cyclins, proteins whose levels oscillate during each cell cycle. Additional CDK  family members were subsequently discovered that play significant roles in a  wide range of activities including the control of gene transcription,  metabolism, and neuronal function. In response to mitogenic stimuli, cells in  the G1 phase of the cell cycle produce cyclins of the D type that activate  CDK4/6. These activated enzymes catalyze the monophosphorylation of the  retinoblastoma protein. Then CDK2-cyclin E catalyzes the hyperphosphorylation of  Rb that promotes the release and activation of the E2F transcription factors,  which in turn lead to the generation of several proteins required for cell cycle  progression. As a result, cells pass through the G1-restriction point and are  committed to complete cell division. CDK2-cyclin A, CDK1-cyclin A, and  CDK1-cyclin B are required for S, G2, and M-phase progression. Increased cyclin  or CDK expression or decreased levels of endogenous CDK inhibitors such as INK4  or CIP/KIP have been observed in various cancers. In contrast to the mutational  activation of EGFR, Kit, or B-Raf in the pathogenesis of malignancies, mutations  in the CDKs that cause cancers are rare. Owing to their role in cell  proliferation, CDKs represent natural targets for anticancer therapies.  Abemaciclib (LY2835219), ribociclib (Lee011), and palbociclib (Ibrance(®) or  PD0332991) target CDK4/6 with IC50 values in the low nanomolar range.  Palbociclib and other CDK inhibitors bind in the cleft between the small and  large lobes of the CDKs and inhibit the binding of ATP. Like ATP, palbociclib  forms hydrogen bonds with residues in the hinge segment of the cleft. Like the  adenine base of ATP, palbociclib interacts with catalytic spine residues CS6 and  CS7. CDK antagonists are in clinical trials for the treatment of a variety of  malignancies. Significantly, palbociclib has been approved by the FDA for the  treatment of hormone-receptor positive/human epidermal growth factor receptor-2  negative breast cancer in conjunction with letrozole as a first-line therapy and  with fulvestrant as a second-line treatment. As inhibitors of the cell cycle, it  is not surprising that one of their most common toxicities is myelosuppression  with decreased neutrophil production.', 'Acute kidney injury (AKI) is a potentially fatal syndrome characterized by a  rapid decline in kidney function caused by ischemic or toxic injury to renal  tubular cells. The widely used chemotherapy drug cisplatin accumulates  preferentially in the renal tubular cells and is a frequent cause of  drug-induced AKI. During the development of AKI the quiescent tubular cells  reenter the cell cycle. Strategies that block cell-cycle progression ameliorate  kidney injury, possibly by averting cell division in the presence of extensive  DNA damage. However, the early signaling events that lead to cell-cycle  activation during AKI are not known. In the current study, using mouse models of  cisplatin nephrotoxicity, we show that the G1/S-regulating cyclin-dependent  kinase 4/6 (CDK4/6) pathway is activated in parallel with renal cell-cycle entry  but before the development of AKI. Targeted inhibition of CDK4/6 pathway by  small-molecule inhibitors palbociclib (PD-0332991) and ribociclib (LEE011)  resulted in inhibition of cell-cycle progression, amelioration of kidney injury,  and improved overall survival. Of additional significance, these compounds were  found to be potent inhibitors of organic cation transporter 2 (OCT2), which  contributes to the cellular accumulation of cisplatin and subsequent kidney  injury. The unique cell-cycle and OCT2-targeting activities of palbociclib and  LEE011, combined with their potential for clinical translation, support their  further exploration as therapeutic candidates for prevention of AKI.', 'Clinical and preclinical data support a significant role for inhibitors of the  cyclin-dependent kinases (CDKs) 4 and 6 in the treatment of patients with breast  cancer. Recently, based on data showing improvement in progression-free  survival, the use of palbociclib (Ibrance; Pfizer, Inc.) in combination with  endocrine agents was approved to treat patients with hormone receptor-positive  advanced disease. Importantly, 2 other CDK4/6 inhibitors, abemaciclib  (LY2835219; Lilly) and ribociclib (LEE011; Novartis), are in the late stage of  clinical development. In this review, we will focus on clinical data on these 2  new drugs, highlighting their differences compared to palbociclib in terms of  single-agent activity, central nervous system penetration, and common adverse  events. In addition, we will present the ongoing clinical trials and discuss  future directions in the field.', 'PURPOSE OF REVIEW: The epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) is overexpressed  in many nonsmall cell lung cancers (NSCLCs). Blockade of EGFR by monoclonal  antibodies has been studied as a strategy to improve the outcome of first-line  chemotherapy in patients with NSCLC. The present review updates the findings  from phase III trials. RECENT FINDINGS: Cetuximab improved survival when combined with first-line  chemotherapy and this benefit was limited to patients with high EGFR expression  in their tumors. A Southwest Oncology Group study currently prospectively  evaluates the predictive biomarkers for cetuximab. In the SQUIRE phase III  trial, necitumumab added to cisplatin and gemcitabine increased the survival in  patients with advanced squamous cell NSCLC. The INSPIRE trial studied  chemotherapy with and without necitumumab in patients with nonsquamous NSCLC but  was prematurely halted because of increased thromboembolic events with  chemotherapy and necitumumab. SUMMARY: EGFR monoclonal antibodies improved the outcome including survival in  selected patients with advanced NSCLC. Prospective validation of predictive  biomarkers is ongoing.', 'Overexpression of the epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) is a common  characteristic of head and neck squamous cell carcinomas (HNSCC). Cetuximab is a  chimeric anti-EGFR monoclonal antibody (mAb) with multiple approved indications  in HNSCC, including with radiation therapy (RT) for locoregionally advanced  disease, as monotherapy after platinum progression, and with  platinum/5-fluorouracil for recurrent or metastatic disease. There remain,  however, numerous unanswered questions regarding the optimal use of cetuximab in  HNSCC, including patient selection, its mechanisms of action and resistance, the  effect of human papillomavirus status on outcomes, its role when combined with  induction chemotherapy or adjuvant radiation, and optimal management of skin  toxicity and hypersensitivity reactions. In addition, a variety of other  anti-EGFR agents (the multitargeted small molecule tyrosine kinase inhibitors  [TKIs] lapatinib, dacomitinib, and afatinib and the anti-EGFR mAbs zalutumumab,  nimotuzumab, and panitumumab) are currently under investigation in phase II and  III clinical trials in different HNSCC therapeutic settings. The anti-EGFR TKI  erlotinib is currently in phase III development for oral cancer prevention.  Numerous other drugs are in earlier stages of development for HNSCC treatment,  including novel anti-EGFR mAbs (MEHD7945A, necitumumab, and RO5083945),  small-molecule TKIs (vandetanib, icotinib, and CUDC-101), EGFR antisense,  various add-on therapies to radiation and chemotherapy (bevacizumab,  interleukin-12, lenalidomide, alisertib, and VTX-2337), and drugs (temsirolimus,  everolimus, OSI-906, dasatinib, and PX-866) intended to overcome resistance to  anti-EGFR agents. Overall, a wealth of clinical trial data is expected in the  coming years, with the potential to modify significantly the approach to  anti-EGFR therapy for HNSCC.', 'BACKGROUND: Necitumumab is a second-generation, recombinant, human  immunoglobulin G1 EGFR antibody. In this study, we aimed to compare treatment  with necitumumab plus gemcitabine and cisplatin versus gemcitabine and cisplatin  alone in patients with previously untreated stage IV squamous non-small-cell  lung cancer. METHODS: We did this open-label, randomised phase 3 study at 184 investigative  sites in 26 countries. Patients aged 18 years or older with histologically or  cytologically confirmed stage IV squamous non-small-cell lung cancer, with an  Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group (ECOG) performance status of 0-2 and adequate  organ function and who had not received previous chemotherapy for their disease  were eligible for inclusion. Enrolled patients were randomly assigned centrally  1:1 to a maximum of six 3-week cycles of gemcitabine and cisplastin chemotherapy  with or without necitumumab according to a block randomisation scheme (block  size of four) by a telephone-based interactive voice response system or  interactive web response system. Chemotherapy was gemcitabine 1250 mg/m(2)  administered intravenously over 30 min on days 1 and 8 of a 3-week cycle and  cisplatin 75 mg/m(2) administered intravenously over 120 min on day 1 of a  3-week cycle. Necitumumab 800 mg, administered intravenously over a minimum of  50 min on days 1 and 8, was continued after the end of chemotherapy until  disease progression or intolerable toxic side-effects occurred. Randomisation  was stratified by ECOG performance status and geographical region. Neither  physicians nor patients were masked to group assignment because of the expected  occurrence of acne-like rash--a class effect of EGFR antibodies--that would have  unmasked most patients and investigators to treatment. The primary endpoint was  overall survival, analysed by intention to treat. We report the final clinical  analysis. This study is registered with ClinicalTrials.gov, number NCT00981058. FINDINGS: Between Jan 7, 2010, and Feb 22, 2012, we enrolled 1093 patients and  randomly assigned them to receive necitumumab plus gemcitabine and cisplatin  (n=545) or gemcitabine and cisplatin (n=548). Overall survival was significantly  longer in the necitumumab plus gemcitabine and cisplatin group than in the  gemcitabine and cisplatin alone group (median 11·5 months [95% CI 10·4-12·6]) vs  9·9 months [8·9-11·1]; stratified hazard ratio 0·84 [95% CI 0·74-0·96; p=0·01]).  In the necitumumab plus gemcitabine and cisplatin group, the number of patients  with at least one grade 3 or worse adverse event was higher (388 [72%] of 538  patients) than in the gemcitabine and cisplatin group (333 [62%] of 541), as was  the incidence of serious adverse events (257 [48%] of 538 patients vs 203 [38%]  of 541). More patients in the necitumumab plus gemcitabine and cisplatin group  had grade 3-4 hypomagnesaemia (47 [9%] of 538 patients in the necitumumab plus  gemcitabine and cisplatin group vs six [1%] of 541 in the gemcitabine and  cisplatin group) and grade 3 rash (20 [4%] vs one [<1%]). Including events  related to disease progression, adverse events with an outcome of death were  reported for 66 (12%) of 538 patients in the necitumumab plus gemcitabine and  cisplatin group and 57 (11%) of 541 patients in the gemcitabine and cisplatin  group; these were deemed to be related to study drugs in 15 (3%) and ten (2%)  patients, respectively. Overall, we found that the safety profile of necitumumab  plus gemcitabine and cisplatin was acceptable and in line with expectations. INTERPRETATION: Our findings show that the addition of necitumumab to  gemcitabine and cisplatin chemotherapy improves overall survival in patients  with advanced squamous non-small-cell lung cancer and represents a new  first-line treatment option for this disease. FUNDING: Eli Lilly and Company.', 'Blockade of the epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) by monoclonal antibodies  is a strategy to improve outcome in patients with non-small cell lung cancer.  Cetuximab, a chimeric anti-EGFR monoclonal antibody, has been studied in  combination with different chemotherapy protocols in both phase II and phase III  trials in patients with advanced NSCLC. In the phase III FLEX trial, cetuximab  added to cisplatin/vinorelbine resulted in an absolute overall survival benefit  of 1.2 months compared to the same chemotherapy alone in patients with advanced  EGFR-expressing NSCLC. In the second phase III trial, cetuximab added to  carboplatin plus paclitaxed failed to improve progression-free survival but  suggested a survival benefit similar to that seen in the FLEX trial. However,  the benefit in survival reached statistical significance only in the FLEX trial.  A meta-analysis that included patients from four randomized trials confirmed the  efficacy of cetuximab when added to chemotherapy. Thus addition of cetuximab to  platinum-based chemotherapy represents a new treatment option for patients with  advanced NSCLC. Matuzumab and panitumumab have also been evaluated in phase II  trials. Necitumumab is currently evaluated in combination with chemotherapy in  two randomized phase III trials.', 'Cancer cells bypass normal controls over mitotic cell-cycle progression to  achieve a deregulated state of proliferation. The retinoblastoma tumor  suppressor protein (pRb) governs a key cell-cycle checkpoint that normally  prevents G1-phase cells from entering S-phase in the absence of appropriate  mitogenic signals. Cancer cells frequently overcome pRb-dependent growth  suppression via constitutive phosphorylation and inactivation of pRb function by  cyclin-dependent kinase (CDK) 4 or CDK6 partnered with D-type cyclins. Three  selective CDK4/6 inhibitors, palbociclib (Ibrance; Pfizer), ribociclib  (Novartis), and abemaciclib (Lilly), are in various stages of development in a  variety of pRb-positive tumor types, including breast cancer, melanoma,  liposarcoma, and non-small cell lung cancer. The emerging, positive clinical  data obtained to date finally validate the two decades-old hypothesis that the  cyclin D-CDK4/6 pathway is a rational target for cancer therapy.', 'Glioblastoma multiforme (GBM) is the most common primary brain tumor in adults,  and the limited available treatment options have not meaningfully impacted  patient survival in the past decades. Such poor outcomes can be at least partly  attributed to the inability of most drugs tested to cross the blood-brain  barrier and reach all areas of the glioma. The objectives of these studies were  to visualize and compare by matrix-assisted laser desorption ionization (MALDI)  imaging mass spectrometry the brain and tumor distribution of the  phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase (PI3K) inhibitors pictilisib (GDC-0941,  2-(1H-indazol-4-yl)-6-(4-methanesulfonyl-piperazin-1-ylmethyl)-4-morpholin-4-yl-thieno[3,2-d]pyrimidine)  and GNE-317  [5-(6-(3-methoxyoxetan-3-yl)-7-methyl-4-morpholinothieno[3,2-d]pyrimidin-2-yl)pyrimidin-2-amine]  in U87 and GS2 orthotopic models of GBM, models that exhibit differing  blood-brain barrier characteristics. Following administration to tumor-bearing  mice, pictilisib was readily detected within tumors of the contrast-enhancing  U87 model whereas it was not located in tumors of the nonenhancing GS2 model. In  both GBM models, pictilisib was not detected in the healthy brain. In contrast,  GNE-317 was uniformly distributed throughout the brain in the U87 and GS2  models. MALDI imaging revealed also that the pictilisib signal varied regionally  by up to 6-fold within the U87 tumors whereas GNE-317 intratumor levels were  more homogeneous. Liquid chromatography coupled with tandem mass spectrometry  (LC-MS/MS) analyses of the nontumored half of the brain showed pictilisib had  brain-to-plasma ratios lower than 0.03 whereas they were greater than 1 for  GNE-317, in agreement with their brain penetration properties. These results in  orthotopic models representing either the contrast-enhancing or invasive areas  of GBM clearly demonstrate the need for whole-brain distribution to potentially  achieve long-term efficacy in GBM.']]]",Palbociclib targets CDK4/6.,"[{'Exact': array([ 0.98736857,  6.80921696, -2.56305048,  0.0773615 ,  0.64439528,

What protein is encoded by the GRN gene?,"[[['Progranulin is a growth factor involved in the regulation of multiple processes  including tumorigenesis, wound repair, development, and inflammation. The recent  discovery that mutations in the gene encoding for progranulin (GRN) cause  frontotemporal lobar degeneration (FTLD), and other neurodegenerative diseases  leading to dementia, has brought renewed interest in progranulin and its  functions in the central nervous system. GRN null mutations cause protein  haploinsufficiency, leading to a significant decrease in progranulin levels that  can be detected in plasma, serum and cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) of mutation  carriers. The dosage of circulating progranulin sped up the identification of  GRN mutations thus favoring genotype-phenotype correlation studies. Researchers  demonstrated that, in GRN null mutation carriers, the shortage of progranulin  invariably precedes clinical symptoms and thus mutation carriers are ""captured""  regardless of their disease status. GRN is a particularly appealing gene for  drug targeting, in the way that boosting its expression may be beneficial for  mutation carriers, preventing or delaying the onset of GRN-related  neurodegenerative diseases. Physiological regulation of progranulin expression  level is only partially known. Progranulin expression reflects mutation status  and, intriguingly, its levels can be modulated by some additional factor (i.e.  genetic background; drugs). Thus, factors increasing the production and  secretion of progranulin from the normal gene are promising potential  therapeutic avenues. In conclusion, peripheral progranulin is a nonintrusive  highly accurate biomarker for early identification of mutation carriers and for  monitoring future treatments that might boost the level of this protein.', 'It has been more than a decade since heterozygous loss-of-function mutations in  the progranulin gene (GRN) were first identified as an important genetic cause  of frontotemporal lobar degeneration (FTLD). Due to the highly diverse  biological functions of the progranulin (PGRN) protein, encoded by GRN, multiple  possible disease mechanisms have been proposed. Early work focused on the  neurotrophic properties of PGRN and its role in the inflammatory response.  However, since the discovery of homozygous GRN mutations in patients with a  lysosomal storage disorder, investigation into the possible roles of PGRN and  its proteolytic cleavage products granulins, in lysosomal function and  dysfunction, has taken center stage. In this chapter, we summarize the GRN  mutational spectrum and its associated phenotypes followed by an in-depth  discussion on the possible disease mechanisms implicated in FTLD-GRN. We  conclude with key outstanding questions which urgently require answers to ensure  safe and successful therapy development for GRN mutation carriers.', 'The granulin protein (also known as, and hereafter referred to as, progranulin)  is a secreted glycoprotein that contributes to overall brain health.  Heterozygous loss-of-function mutations in the gene encoding the progranulin  protein (Granulin Precursor, GRN) are a common cause of familial frontotemporal  dementia (FTD). Gene therapy approaches that aim to increase progranulin  expression from a single wild-type allele, an area of active investigation for  the potential treatment of GRN-dependent FTD, will benefit from the availability  of a mouse model that expresses a genomic copy of the human GRN gene. Here we  report the development and characterization of a novel mouse model that  expresses the entire human GRN gene in its native genomic context as a single  copy inserted into a defined locus (Hprt) in the mouse genome. We show that  human and mouse progranulin are expressed in a similar tissue-specific pattern,  suggesting that the two genes are regulated by similar mechanisms. Human  progranulin rescues a phenotype characteristic of progranulin-null mice, the  exaggerated and early deposition of the aging pigment lipofuscin in the brain,  indicating that the two proteins are functionally similar. Longitudinal  behavioural and neuropathological analyses revealed no significant differences  between wild-type and human progranulin-overexpressing mice up to 18\xa0months of  age, providing evidence that long-term increase of progranulin levels is well  tolerated in mice. Finally, we demonstrate that human progranulin expression can  be increased in the brain using an antisense oligonucleotide that inhibits a  known GRN-regulating micro-RNA, demonstrating that the transgene is responsive  to potential gene therapy drugs. Human progranulin-expressing mice represent a  novel and valuable tool to expedite the development of progranulin-modulating  therapeutics.', 'The Grg gene encodes a 197-amino-acid protein homologous to the amino-terminal  domain of the product of the groucho gene of the Drosophila Enhancer of split  complex. We describe here the genomic organization of the mouse Grg gene. It  spans approximately 7 kb on chromosome 10 and consists of seven exons. The 3\'  region of the Grg gene contains two functional polyadenylation sites that give  rise to two transcripts that are differentially expressed among adult mouse  tissues. The promoter region is very GC rich and lacks TATA box and ""initiator""  sequences. Primer extension analysis and ribonuclease protection assays show  that Grg has a major transcription start site situated down-stream of putative  binding motifs for the transcription factors Sp1, E2A, and PuF.', 'Loss-of-function mutations in the gene encoding for the protein progranulin  (PGRN), GRN, are one of the major genetic abnormalities involved in  frontotemporal lobar degeneration. However, genetic variations, mainly missense,  in GRN have also been linked to other neurodegenerative diseases. We found 12  different pathogenic/likely pathogenic variants in 21 patients identified in a  cohort of Italian patients affected by various neurodegenerative disorders. We  detected the p.Thr272SerfsTer10 as the most frequent, followed by the  c.1179+3A>G variant. We characterized the clinical phenotype of 12 patients from  3 pedigrees carrying the c.1179+3A>G variant, demonstrated the pathogenicity of  this mutation, and detected other rarer variants causing haploinsufficiency  (p.Met1?, c.709-2A>T, p.Gly79AspfsTer39). Finally, by applying bioinformatics,  neuropathological, and biochemical studies, we characterized 6  missense/synonymous variants (p.Asp94His, p.Gly117Asp, p.Ala266Pro, p.Val279Val,  p.Arg298His, p.Ala505Gly), including 4 previously unreported. The designation of  variants is crucial for genetic counseling and the enrollment of patients in  clinical studies.', ""Neurodegenerative diseases such as Alzheimer's disease have proven resistant to  new treatments. The complexity of neurodegenerative disease mechanisms can be  highlighted by accumulating evidence for a role for a growth factor, progranulin  (PGRN). PGRN is a glycoprotein encoded by the GRN/Grn gene with multiple  cellular functions, including neurotrophic, anti-inflammatory and lysosome  regulatory properties. Mutations in the GRN gene can lead to frontotemporal  lobar degeneration (FTLD), a cause of dementia, and neuronal ceroid  lipofuscinosis (NCL), a lysosomal storage disease. Both diseases are associated  with loss of PGRN function resulting, amongst other features, in enhanced  microglial neuroinflammation and lysosomal dysfunction. PGRN has also been  implicated in Alzheimer's disease (AD). Unlike FTLD, increased expression of  PGRN occurs in brains of human AD cases and AD model mice, particularly in  activated microglia. How microglial PGRN might be involved in AD and other  neurodegenerative diseases will be discussed. A unifying feature of PGRN in  diseases might be its modulation of lysosomal function in neurons and microglia.  Many experimental models have focused on consequences of PGRN gene deletion:  however, possible outcomes of increasing PGRN on microglial inflammation and  neurodegeneration will be discussed. We will also suggest directions for future  studies on PGRN and microglia in relation to neurodegenerative diseases."", 'Numerous kindreds with familial frontotemporal lobar degeneration have been  linked to mutations in microtubule-associated protein tau (MAPT) or progranulin  (GRN) genes. While there are many similarities in the clinical manifestations  and associated neuroimaging findings, there are also distinct differences. In  this review, we compare and contrast the demographic/inheritance  characteristics, histopathology, pathophysiology, clinical aspects, and key  neuroimaging findings between those with MAPT and GRN mutations.', 'Progranulin (PGRN) is known to play a role in the pathogenesis of  neurodegenerative diseases. Recently, it has been demonstrated that patients  with the homozygous mutation in the GRN gene present with neuronal ceroid  lipofuscinosis, and there is growing evidence that PGRN is related to lysosomal  function. In the present study, we investigated the possible role of PGRN in the  lysosomes of activated microglia in the cerebral cortex after traumatic brain  injury (TBI). We showed that the mouse GRN gene has two possible coordinated  lysosomal expression and regulation (CLEAR) sequences that bind to transcription  factor EB (TFEB), a master regulator of lysosomal genes. PGRN was colocalized  with Lamp1, a lysosomal marker, and Lamp1-positive areas in GRN-deficient (KO)  mice were significantly expanded compared with wild-type (WT) mice after TBI.  Expression of all the lysosome-related genes examined in KO mice was  significantly higher than that in WT mice. The number of activated microglia  with TFEB localized to the nucleus was also significantly increased in KO as  compared with WT mice. Since the TFEB translocation is regulated by the  mammalian target of rapamycin complex 1 (mTORC1) activity in the lysosome, we  compared ribosomal S6 kinase 1 (S6K1) phosphorylation that reflects mTORC1  activity. S6K1 phosphorylation in KO mice was significantly lower than that in  WT mice. In addition, the number of nissl-positive and fluoro-jade B-positive  cells around the injury was significantly decreased and increased, respectively,  in KO as compared with WT mice. These results suggest that PGRN localized in the  lysosome is involved in the activation of mTORC1, and its deficiency leads to  increased TFEB nuclear translocation with a resultant increase in lysosomal  biogenesis in activated microglia and exacerbated neuronal damage in the  cerebral cortex after TBI.', ""BACKGROUND: Progranulin protein (PGRN) is a cysteine-rich growth factor encoded  by the progranulin gene (GRN). PGRN mutations were identified in patients with  frontotemporal lobar degeneration (FTLD) and recently its role as risk factor  has been described in patients with probable Alzheimer's disease (AD). To date,  more than 100 genetic variants in GRN gene have been described and the  pathogenic nature is still unclear for almost 36% of them. OBJECTIVE: Here, we describe three clinical cases carrying the PGRN variation  Cys139Arg in order to increase the knowledge on the association of this variant  to the clinical spectrum of FTLD. METHODS: The genetic analysis was performed using high resolution melting  analysis. The Human Progranulin ELISA Kit was used in order to determine PGRN  expression levels in the plasma samples. RESULTS: The three patients carrying the genetic variation showed three final  different clinical diagnosis, respectively behavioral frontotemporal dementia,  semantic dementia, and corticobasal syndrome, thus underlining the clinical  heterogeneity typically associated with GRN mutations. All cases shared similar  plasma PGRN levels that resulted intermediate between those measured in controls  and in GRN null mutation carriers, showing a partial reduction of the protein in  plasma. Moreover, according to the bioinformatics software, the Cys139Arg  variation causes a decreased stability of the structure of the protein. CONCLUSION: We describe three new patients affected by neurological syndromes  included in the clinical spectrum of FTLD carrying the Cys139Arg genetic  variant, thus suggesting a possible implication in the pathogenesis of FTLD."", 'The mouse Grg gene encodes a 197 amino acid nuclear protein homologous to the  amino-terminal domain of the product of the groucho (gro) gene of the Drosophila  Enhancer of split complex. Recent work has suggested that the gro protein  functions as a transcriptional corepressor during Drosophila development. We  therefore examined possible roles of the mouse Grg protein in DNA binding and in  vitro transcription. No sequence-specific DNA binding activity was detected by  polymerase chain reaction-DNA binding site selection nor was the glutamine-rich  Grg protein capable of acting as an activation domain in an in vivo  transactivation assay. However, depletion of Grg protein from HeLa nuclear  extracts inhibited the in vitro transcription activity of the extracts. We  suggest that Grg protein may interact with components of the basal transcription  machinery.']]]",The protein encoded by the GRN gene is progranulin (PGRN).,"[{'Exact': array([-2.22980612,  7.37696435, -3.02787135, -2.42111636,  2.94866947,

Which growth factors are known to be involved in the induction of EMT?,"[[['BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: Hypoxia is a hallmark of solid cancers and associated  with metastases and treatment failure. During tumor progression epithelial cells  often acquire mesenchymal features, a phenomenon known as  epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition (EMT). Intratumoral hypoxia has been linked  to EMT induction. We hypothesized that signals from the tumor microenvironment  such as growth factors and tumor oxygenation collaborate to promote EMT and  thereby contribute to radioresistance. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Gene expression changes under hypoxia were analyzed using  microarray and validated by qRT-PCR. Conversion of epithelial phenotype upon  hypoxic exposure, TGFβ addition or oncogene activation was investigated by  Western blot and immunofluorescence. Cell survival following ionizing radiation  was assayed using clonogenic survival. RESULTS: Upon hypoxia, TGFβ addition or EGFRvIII expression, MCF7, A549 and  NMuMG epithelial cells acquired a spindle shape and lost cell-cell contacts.  Expression of epithelial markers such as E-cadherin decreased, whereas  mesenchymal markers such as vimentin and N-cadherin increased. Combining hypoxia  with TGFβ or EGFRvIII expression, lead to more rapid and pronounced EMT-like  phenotype. Interestingly, E-cadherin expression and the mesenchymal appearance  were reversible upon reoxygenation. Mesenchymal conversion and E-cadherin loss  were associated with radioresistance. CONCLUSIONS: Our findings describe a mechanism by which the tumor  microenvironment may contribute to tumor radioresistance via E-cadherin loss and  EMT.', 'BACKGROUND: Metastatic castration-resistant prostate cancer (mCRPC) is one of  the main contributors to the death of prostate cancer patients. To date, the  detailed molecular mechanisms underlying mCRPC are unclear. Given the crucial  role of epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT) in cancer metastasis, we aimed  to analyse the expression and function of Transforming growth factor-beta  (TGF-β) signal-associated protein named Sox5 in mCRPC. METHODS: The protein expression levels were analysed by western blot,  immunohistochemistry and immunofluorescence. Luciferase reporter assays and  chromatin immunoprecipitation were employed to validate the target of Sox5. The  effect of Smad3/Sox5/Twist1 on PCa progression was investigated in vitro and in  vivo. RESULTS: Here, we found that TGF-β-induced EMT was accompanied by increased Sox5  expression. Interestingly, knockdown of Sox5 expression attenuated EMT induced  by TGF-β signalling. Furthermore, we demonstrated that Smad3 could bind to the  promoter of Sox5 and regulate its expression. Mechanistically, Sox5 could bind  to Twist1 promoter and active Twist1, which initiated EMT. Importantly,  knockdown of Sox5 in prostate cancer cells resulted in less of the mesenchymal  phenotype and cell migration ability. Furthermore, targeting Sox5 could inhibit  prostate cancer progression in a xenograft mouse model. In clinic, patients with  high Sox5 expression were more likely to suffer from metastases, and high Sox5  expression also has a lower progression-free survival and cancer  specific-survival in clinic database. CONCLUSIONS: Therefore, we propose a new mechanism in which Smad3/Sox5/Twist1  promotes EMT and contributes to PCa progression.', 'Epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT) is believed to play an important role in  fibrosis and tumor invasion. EMT can be induced in vitro cell culture by various  stimuli including growth factors and matrix metalloproteinases. In this study,  we report that cytomix (a mixture of IL-1beta, TNF-alpha and IFN-gamma)  significantly enhances TGF-beta1-induced EMT in A549 cells as evidenced by  acquisition of fibroblast-like cell shape, loss of E-cadherin, and  reorganization of F-actin. IL-1beta or TNF-alpha alone can also augment  TGF-beta1-induced EMT. However, a combination of IL-1beta and TNF-alpha or the  cytomix is more potent to induce EMT. Cytomix, but not individual cytokine of  IL-1beta, TNF-alpha or IFN-gamma, significantly up-regulates expression of  TGF-beta receptor type I (TbetaR-I). Suppression of TbetaR-I, Smad2 or Smad3 by  siRNA partially blocks EMT induction by cytomix plus TGF-beta1, indicating  cytomix augments TGF-beta1-induced EMT through enhancing TbetaR-I and Smad  signaling. These results indicate that inflammatory cytokines together with  TGF-beta1 may play an important role in the development of fibrosis and tumor  progress via the mechanism of epithelial-mesenchymal transition.', 'Anchorage-independent survival and growth are critical characteristics of  malignant cells. We showed previously that the addition of exogenous hepatocyte  growth factor (HGF) and the presence of fibronectin fibrils stimulate  anchorage-independent colony growth of a murine mammary carcinoma, SP1, which  expresses both HGF and HGF receptor (Met; R. Saulnier et al., Exp. Cell Res.,  222: 360-369, 1996). We now show that tyrosine phosphorylation of Met in  carcinoma cells is augmented by cell adhesion and spreading on fibronectin  substratum. In contrast, detached serum-starved cells exhibit reduced tyrosine  phosphorylation of Met and undergo apoptotic cell death within 18-24 h. Under  these conditions, the addition of HGF stimulates tyrosine phosphorylation of Met  and restores survival of carcinoma cells. Soluble fibronectin also stimulates  cell survival and shows a cooperative survival response with HGF but does not  affect tyrosine phosphorylation of Met; these results indicate that fibronectin  acts via a pathway independent of Met in detached cells. We demonstrated  previously that inhibition of phosphatidylinositol (PI) 3-kinase activity blocks  HGF-induced DNA synthesis of carcinoma cells (N. Rahimi et al., J. Biol. Chem.,  271: 24850-24855, 1996). We now show in detached cells a cooperative effect of  HGF and FN in the activation of PI 3-kinase and on the phosphorylation of  PKB/Akt at serine 473. PI 3-kinase activity is also required for the HGF- and  fibronectin-induced survival responses, as well as anchorage-independent colony  growth. However, c-Src kinase or MEK1/2 activities are not required for the cell  survival effect. Together, these results demonstrate that the PI 3-kinase/Akt  pathway is a key effector of the HGF- and fibronectin-induced survival response  of breast carcinoma cells under detached conditions and corroborate an  interaction between integrin and HGF/ Met signalling pathways in the development  of invasive breast cancer.', 'The NBT-II rat carcinoma cell line exhibits two mutually exclusive responses to  FGF-1 and EGF, entering mitosis at cell confluency while undergoing an  epithelium-to-mesenchyme transition (EMT) when cultured at subconfluency. EMT is  characterized by acquisition of cell motility, modifications of cell morphology,  and cell dissociation correlating with the loss of desmosomes from cellular  cortex. The pleiotropic effects of EGF and FGF-1 on NBT-II cells suggest that  multiple signaling pathways may be activated. We demonstrate here that growth  factor activation is linked to at least two intracellular signaling pathways.  One pathway leading to EMT involves an early and sustained stimulation of  pp60c-src kinase activity, which is not observed during the growth  factor-induced entry into the cell cycle. Overexpression of normal c-src causes  a subpopulation of cells to undergo spontaneous EMT and sensitizes the rest of  the population to the scattering activity of EGF and FGF-1 without affecting  their mitogenic responsiveness. Addition of cholera toxin, a cAMP-elevating  agent, severely perturbs growth factor induction of EMT without altering  pp60c-src activation, therefore demonstrating that cAMP blockade takes place  downstream or independently of pp60c-src. On the other hand, overexpression of a  mutated, constitutively activated form of pp60c-src does not block cell  dispersion while strongly inhibiting growth factor-induced entry into cell  division. Moreover, stable transfection of a dominant negative mutant of c-src  inhibits the scattering response without affecting mitogenesis induced by the  growth factors. Altogether, these results suggest a role for pp60c-src in  epithelial cell scattering and indicate that pp60c-src might contribute  unequally to the two separate biological activities engendered by a single  signal.', 'BACKGROUND: Epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT) is a crucial process in  cancer progression that provides cancer cells with the ability to escape from  the primary focus, invade stromal tissues and migrate to distant regions. Cell  lines that lack E-cadherin show increased tumorigenesis and metastasis, and the  expression levels of E-cadherin and Snail correlate inversely with the prognosis  of patients suffering from breast cancer or oral squamous cell carcinoma (OSCC).  Moreover, recent studies have shown that most EMT cases are regulated by soluble  growth factors or cytokines. Among these factors, fibroblast growth factors  (FGFs) execute diverse functions by binding to and activating members of the FGF  receptor (FGFR) family, including FGFR1-4. Fibroblast growth factor receptor 1  is an oncoprotein that is involved in tumorigenesis, and PD173074 is known to be  a selective inhibitor of FGFR1. However, the roles of FGFR1 and FGFR1 inhibitors  have not yet been examined in detail. METHODS: Here, we investigated the expression of FGFR1 in head and neck squamous  cell carcinoma (HNSCC) and the role of the FGFR1 inhibitor PD173074 in  carcinogenesis and the EMT process. RESULTS: Fibroblast growth factor receptor 1 was highly expressed in 54% of  HNSCC cases and was significantly correlated with malignant behaviours. Nuclear  FGFR1 expression was also observed and correlated well with histological  differentiation, the pattern of invasion and abundant nuclear polymorphism.  Fibroblast growth factor receptor 1 was also overexpressed in EMT cell lines  compared with non-EMT cell lines. Furthermore, treatment of HOC313 cells with  PD173074 suppressed cellular proliferation and invasion and reduced ERK1/2 and  p38 activation. These cells also demonstrated morphological changes,  transforming from spindle- to cobble stone-like in shape. In addition, the  expression levels of certain matrix metalloproteinases (MMPs), whose genes  contain activator protein-1 (AP-1) promoter sites, as well as Snail1 and Snail2  were reduced following PD173074 treatment. CONCLUSION: Taken together, these data suggest that PD173074 inhibits the MAPK  pathway, which regulates the activity of AP-1 and induces MET. Furthermore, this  induction of MET likely suppresses cancer cell growth and invasion.', 'Multistep carcinogenesis involves more than six discrete events also important  in normal development and cell behavior. Of these, local invasion and metastasis  cause most cancer deaths but are the least well understood molecularly. We  employed a combined in vitro/in vivo carcinogenesis model, that is, polarized  Ha-Ras-transformed mammary epithelial cells (EpRas), to dissect the role of Ras  downstream signaling pathways in epithelial cell plasticity, tumorigenesis, and  metastasis. Ha-Ras cooperates with transforming growth factor beta (TGFbeta) to  cause epithelial mesenchymal transition (EMT) characterized by spindle-like cell  morphology, loss of epithelial markers, and induction of mesenchymal markers.  EMT requires continuous TGFbeta receptor (TGFbeta-R) and oncogenic Ras signaling  and is stabilized by autocrine TGFbeta production. In contrast, fibroblast  growth factors, hepatocyte growth factor/scatter factor, or TGFbeta alone induce  scattering, a spindle-like cell phenotype fully reversible after factor  withdrawal, which does not involve sustained marker changes. Using specific  inhibitors and effector-specific Ras mutants, we show that a hyperactive  Raf/mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) is required for EMT, whereas  activation of phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase (PI3K) causes scattering and  protects from TGFbeta-induced apoptosis. Hyperactivation of the PI3K pathway or  the Raf/MAPK pathway are sufficient for tumorigenesis, whereas EMT in vivo and  metastasis required a hyperactive Raf/MAPK pathway. Thus, EMT seems to be a  close in vitro correlate of metastasis, both requiring synergism between  TGFbeta-R and Raf/MAPK signaling.', 'Hepatocyte growth factor (HGF) is up-regulated in tissue repair and has been  implicated in playing a role in this process through its anti-apoptotic and  proliferative activities. Cyclooxygenase-2 (COX-2) is an inducible enzyme in the  biosynthetic pathway of prostaglandins, and its activation has been shown to  play an important role in cell growth. We previously reported that HGF  significantly inhibited anoikis, possibly through the up-regulation of COX-2  expression in the endometrial RL95-2 cancer cell line. Here, we report that i)  treatment of RL95-2 cells with HGF resulted in phosphorylation of the HGF  receptor c-Met, activation of Akt and IκB, translocation of NF-κB into the  nucleus, and up-regulation of COX-2 mRNA; ii) the IκB-α phosphorylation  inhibitor BAY11-7082 and the selective COX-2 inhibitor CAY10452 blocked  HGF-mediated anoikis resistance in RL95-2 cells; and iii) HGF induced migration  and invasion in RL95-2 cells, while the phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase (PI3K)  inhibitor LY294002 and CAY10452 blocked these effects of HGF stimulation. Our  data suggest that HGF possesses chemotactic ability, has anti-apoptosis action,  and induces cellular infiltration via the PI3K/Akt pathway; it also triggers  NF-κB activation and up-regulates COX-2 gene expression in endometrial cancer  cells.', 'BACKGROUND: Chemotaxis is defined as directional cell movement of cells towards  concentration gradients of solubilized attractants, whereas chemokinesis is  defined as random cell movement in the absence of chemoattractant gradients.  Since tumor cell motility plays an important role in the process of tumor  invasion and metastasis, we investigated these two distinct motile behaviors in  highly invasive tumor, malignant mesothelioma. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Chemotaxis and chemokinesis of mesothelioma cells were  assayed using Boyden chambers fitted with filters coated with collagen type IV  and different growth factors and cytokines were used as chemoattractants. RESULTS: We found that growth factors such as epidermal growth factor,  transforming growth factor-alpha, amphiregulin, heparin-binding epidermal growth  factor-like growth factor, beta-cellulin, insulin-like growth factor-I,  insulin-like growth factor-II and stem cell factor stimulated directional  (chemotactic) and/or random (chemokinetic) motility in all mesothelioma cell  lines tested, whereas none of acidic fibroblast growth factor, basic fibroblast  growth factor, granulocyte-macrophage colony-stimulating factor or interleukin-6  induced migration in the same mesothelioma cells. CONCLUSION: These findings provide evidence that: (i) multiple growth factors  can induce chemotaxis and chemokinesis in malignant mesothelioma cell lines, and  (ii) may contribute to our understanding of the highly invasive behavior of  malignant mesotheliomas in vivo.', 'Tumors are cellularly and molecularly heterogeneous, with subsets of  undifferentiated cancer cells exhibiting stem cell-like features (CSCs).  Epithelial to mesenchymal transitions (EMT) are transdifferentiation programs  that are required for tissue morphogenesis during embryonic development. The EMT  process can be regulated by a diverse array of cytokines and growth factors,  such as transforming growth factor (TGF)-beta, whose activities are dysregulated  during malignant tumor progression. Thus, EMT induction in cancer cells results  in the acquisition of invasive and metastatic properties. Recent reports  indicate that the emergence of CSCs occurs in part as a result of EMT, for  example, through cues from tumor stromal components. Recent evidence now  indicates that EMT of tumor cells not only causes increased metastasis, but also  contributes to drug resistance. In this review, we will provide potential  mechanistic explanations for the association between EMT induction and the  emergence of CSCs. We will also highlight recent studies implicating the  function of TGF-beta-regulated noncoding RNAs in driving EMT and promoting CSC  self-renewal. Finally we will discuss how EMT and CSCs may contribute to drug  resistance, as well as therapeutic strategies to overcome this clinically.']]]","Based on the provided context, several growth factors are known to be involved in the induction of EMT:

Can ATAC-Seq be employed in single-cell mode?,"[[['Most genomes to date have been sequenced without taking into account the diploid  nature of the genome. However, the distribution of variants on each individual  chromosome can (1) significantly impact gene regulation and protein function,  (2) have important implications for analyses of population history and medical  genetics, and (3) be of great value for accurate interpretation of medically  relevant genetic variation. Here, we describe a comprehensive and detailed  protocol for an ultra fast (<3 h library preparation), cost-effective, and  scalable haplotyping method, named Contiguity Preserving Transposition  sequencing or CPT-seq (Amini et al., Nat Genet 46(12):1343-1349, 2014). CPT-seq  accurately phases >95 % of the whole human genome in Mb-scale phasing blocks.  Additionally, the same workflow can be used to aid de novo assembly (Adey et  al., Genome Res 24(12):2041-2049, 2014), detect structural variants, and perform  single cell ATAC-seq analysis (Cusanovich et al., Science 348(6237):910-914,  2015).', 'Enhancers are cis-acting sequences that regulate transcription rates of their  target genes in a cell-specific manner and harbor disease-associated sequence  variants in cognate cell types. Many complex diseases are associated with  enhancer malfunction, necessitating the discovery and study of enhancers from  clinical samples. Assay for Transposase Accessible Chromatin (ATAC-seq)  technology can interrogate chromatin accessibility from small cell numbers and  facilitate studying enhancers in pathologies. However, on average, ~35% of open  chromatin regions (OCRs) from ATAC-seq samples map to enhancers. We developed a  neural network-based model, Predicting Enhancers from ATAC-Seq data (PEAS), to  effectively infer enhancers from clinical ATAC-seq samples by extracting  ATAC-seq data features and integrating these with sequence-related features  (e.g., GC ratio). PEAS recapitulated ChromHMM-defined enhancers in CD14+  monocytes, CD4+ T cells, GM12878, peripheral blood mononuclear cells, and  pancreatic islets. PEAS models trained on these 5 cell types effectively  predicted enhancers in four cell types that are not used in model training  (EndoC-βH1, naïve CD8+ T, MCF7, and K562 cells). Finally, PEAS inferred  individual-specific enhancers from 19 islet ATAC-seq samples and revealed  variability in enhancer activity across individuals, including those driven by  genetic differences. PEAS is an easy-to-use tool developed to study enhancers in  pathologies by taking advantage of the increasing number of clinical epigenomes.', 'Author information: (1)Program in Epithelial Biology, Stanford University School of Medicine,  Stanford, CA 94305, USA.

However, very  few studies have been performed at the single cell level (scATAC-seq) due to  technical challenges. Here we developed a simple and robust plate-based  scATAC-seq method, combining upfront bulk Tn5 tagging with single-nuclei  sorting. We demonstrate that our method works robustly across various systems,  including fresh and cryopreserved cells from primary tissues. By profiling over  3000 splenocytes, we identify distinct immune cell types and reveal cell  type-specific regulatory regions and related transcription factors.', 'The regulatory mechanisms that ensure an accurate control of gene transcription  are central to cellular function, development and disease. Such mechanisms rely  largely on noncoding regulatory sequences that allow the establishment and  maintenance of cell identity and tissue-specific cellular functions.The study of  chromatin structure and nucleosome positioning allowed revealing transcription  factor accessible genomic sites with regulatory potential, facilitating the  comprehension of tissue-specific cis-regulatory networks. Recently a new  technique coupled with high-throughput sequencing named Assay for Transposase  Accessible Chromatin (ATAC-seq) emerged as an efficient method to chart open  chromatin genome wide. The application of such technique to different cell types  allowed unmasking tissue-specific regulatory elements and characterizing  cis-regulatory networks. Herein we describe the implementation of the ATAC-seq  method to human pancreatic islets, a tissue playing a central role in the  control of glucose metabolism.', 'Gaining insights into the regulatory mechanisms that underlie the  transcriptional variation observed between individual cells necessitates the  development of methods that measure chromatin organization in single cells. Here  I adapted Nucleosome Occupancy and Methylome-sequencing (NOMe-seq) to measure  chromatin accessibility and endogenous DNA methylation in single cells  (scNOMe-seq). scNOMe-seq recovered characteristic accessibility and DNA  methylation patterns at DNase hypersensitive sites (DHSs). An advantage of  scNOMe-seq is that sequencing reads are sampled independently of the  accessibility measurement. scNOMe-seq therefore controlled for fragment loss,  which enabled direct estimation of the fraction of accessible DHSs within  individual cells. In addition, scNOMe-seq provided high resolution of chromatin  accessibility within individual loci which was exploited to detect footprints of  CTCF binding events and to estimate the average nucleosome phasing distances in  single cells. scNOMe-seq is therefore well-suited to characterize the chromatin  organization of single cells in heterogeneous cellular mixtures.', 'Here we present a comprehensive map of the accessible chromatin landscape of the  mouse hippocampus at single-cell resolution. Substantial advances of this work  include the optimization of a single-cell combinatorial indexing assay for  transposase accessible chromatin (sci-ATAC-seq); a software suite, scitools, for  the rapid processing and visualization of single-cell combinatorial indexing  data sets; and a valuable resource of hippocampal regulatory networks at  single-cell resolution. We used sci-ATAC-seq to produce 2346 high-quality  single-cell chromatin accessibility maps with a mean unique read count per cell  of 29,201 from both fresh and frozen hippocampi, observing little difference in  accessibility patterns between the preparations. By using this data set, we  identified eight distinct major clusters of cells representing both neuronal and  nonneuronal cell types and characterized the driving regulatory factors and  differentially accessible loci that define each cluster. Within pyramidal  neurons, we identified four major clusters, including CA1 and CA3 neurons, and  three additional subclusters. We then applied a recently described  coaccessibility framework, Cicero, which identified 146,818 links between  promoters and putative distal regulatory DNA. Identified coaccessibility  networks showed cell-type specificity, shedding light on key dynamic loci that  reconfigure to specify hippocampal cell lineages. Lastly, we performed an  additional sci-ATAC-seq preparation from cultured hippocampal neurons (899  high-quality cells, 43,532 mean unique reads) that revealed substantial  alterations in their epigenetic landscape compared with nuclei from hippocampal  tissue.

These regions usually correspond to active regulatory elements and  their location profile is unique to a given cell type. When done at single-cell  resolution, ATAC-seq provides an insight into the cell-to-cell variability that  emerges from otherwise identical DNA sequences by identifying the variability in  the genomic location of open chromatin sites in each of the cells. This paper  presents Scasat (single-cell ATAC-seq analysis tool), a complete pipeline to  process scATAC-seq data with simple steps. Scasat treats the data as binary and  applies statistical methods that are especially suitable for binary data. The  pipeline is developed in a Jupyter notebook environment that holds the  executable code along with the necessary description and results. It is robust,  flexible, interactive and easy to extend. Within Scasat we developed a novel  differential accessibility analysis method based on information gain to identify  the peaks that are unique to a cell. The results from Scasat showed that open  chromatin locations corresponding to potential regulatory elements can account  for cellular heterogeneity and can identify regulatory regions that separates  cells from a complex population.', 'Conventional high-throughput genomic technologies for mapping regulatory element  activities in bulk samples such as ChIP-seq, DNase-seq and FAIRE-seq cannot  analyze samples with small numbers of cells. The recently developed low-input  and single-cell regulome mapping technologies such as ATAC-seq and single-cell  ATAC-seq (scATAC-seq) allow analyses of small-cell-number and single-cell  samples, but their signals remain highly discrete or noisy. Compared to these  regulome mapping technologies, transcriptome profiling by RNA-seq is more widely  used. Transcriptome data in single-cell and small-cell-number samples are more  continuous and often less noisy. Here, we show that one can globally predict  chromatin accessibility and infer regulatory element activities using RNA-seq.  Genome-wide chromatin accessibility predicted by RNA-seq from 30 cells can offer  better accuracy than ATAC-seq from 500 cells. Predictions based on single-cell  RNA-seq (scRNA-seq) can more accurately reconstruct bulk chromatin accessibility  than using scATAC-seq. Integrating ATAC-seq with predictions from RNA-seq  increases the power and value of both methods. Thus, transcriptome-based  prediction provides a new tool for decoding gene regulatory circuitry in samples  with limited cell numbers.']]]","Yes, ATAC-Seq can be employed in single-cell mode.

What is Neisseria adhesin A?,"[[['Staphylococcus epidermidis is a frequent pathogen in infections associated with  orthopedic implants. We studied 123 S. epidermidis strains from infections  related to orthopedic implants, as regards their ability to express a factor of  virulence, namely the slime, an extracellular polysaccharide, which mediates  adherence to implants and bacterial colonization. The slime-producing ability  was determined by PCR detection of icaA and icaD genes responsible for slime  synthesis, and by culture on Congo red agar plates in which slime-producing  strains form black colonies, while nonslime-forming ones develop red colonies.  56% of the S. epidermidis isolates were icaA- icaD-positive and grew to become  black colonies. In the evaluation of the distribution of slime-forming strains  in different sites and types of implants, we found a slight, but not  statistically significant, increase in slime-forming strains in total joint  prostheses, where tissue compression near the articular faces can form niches in  which bacteria crowd, sheltered by the slime. Our findings confirm the role of  ica genes as a virulence marker in the pathogenesis of implant-associated  orthopedic infections. However, they do not show the existence of a higher  frequency of slime-positive strains in a specific type of implant.', 'Neisseria meningitidis adhesin A (NadA) is a meningococcus surface protein  thought to assist in the adhesion of the bacterium to host cells. We have  previously shown that NadA also promotes bacterial internalization in a  heterologous expression system. Here we have used the soluble recombinant NadA  (rNadA) lacking the membrane anchor region to characterize its internalization  route in Chang epithelial cells. Added to the culture medium, rNadA internalizes  through a PI3K-dependent endocytosis process not mediated by the canonical  clathrin or caveolin scaffolds, but instead follows an ARF6-regulated recycling  pathway previously described for MHC-I. The intracellular pool of rNadA reaches  a steady state level within one hour of incubation and colocalizes in endocytic  vesicles with MHC-I and with the extracellularly labeled chaperone Hsp90.  Treatment with membrane permeated and impermeable Hsp90 inhibitors 17-AAG and  FITC-GA respectively, lead to intracellular accumulation of rNadA, strongly  suggesting that the extracellular secreted pool of the chaperone is involved in  rNadA intracellular trafficking. A significant number of intracellular vesicles  containing rNadA recruit Rab11, a small GTPase associated to recycling  endosomes, but do not contain transferrin receptor (TfR). Interestingly, cell  treatment with Hsp90 inhibitors, including the membrane-impermeable FITC-GA,  abolished Rab11-rNadA colocalization but do not interfere with Rab11-TfR  colocalization. Collectively, these results are consistent with a model whereby  rNadA internalizes into human epithelial cells hijacking the recycling endosome  pathway and recycle back to the surface of the cell via an ARF6-dependent, Rab11  associated and Hsp90-regulated mechanism. The present study addresses for the  first time a meningoccoccal adhesin mechanism of endocytosis and suggests a  possible entry pathway engaged by N. meningitidis in primary infection of human  epithelial cells.', 'Serogroup B meningococcal (MenB) disease remains a serious public health problem  for which a cross-protective vaccine effective against a wide range of MenB  isolates has not been available. Novartis Vaccines has developed a vaccine for  the prevention of MenB disease that contains four antigenic components: factor H  binding protein (fHbp), neisserial adhesin A (NadA), Neisseria heparin binding  antigen (NHBA) and outer membrane vesicles from a New Zealand epidemic strain  (which provides PorA). This vaccine has been submitted for regulatory review in  Europe so it is timely to review the design of the vaccine, results to date in  clinical studies and the potential strain coverage provided by the vaccine. It  is also critical to discuss the key issues for the long-term success of the  vaccine which include strain coverage, potential persistence of protection,  potential effects on carriage of MenB strains, potential for escape mutants and  cost effectiveness.', 'The physico-chemical characterization of NadADelta(351-405), a recombinant  protein discovered by reverse vaccinology, component of a candidate vaccine  against Neisseria meningitidis serotype B is presented. Analytical methods like  mass spectrometry, electrophoresis, optical spectroscopy and SEC-MALLS have been  applied to unveil the structure of NadADelta(351-405), and to evaluate  Product-Related Substances. Moreover, analysis of the protein after intentional  denaturation has been applied in order to challenge the chosen methods and to  determine their appropriateness and specificity. All the obtained results were  inserted in a model allowing in-depth understanding of the antigen  NadADelta(351-405): it is present in solution as a homo-trimer, retaining a high  percentage of alpha-helix secondary structure, and able to reassemble from  monomeric subunits after thermal denaturation; this structural organization is  consistent with that foreseen for MenB NadA (Neisseria Adhesin A). The  analytical data sets produced during process development for clinical phases  I-III material confirm product quality and manufacturing consistency.', 'Surface-expressed protein antigens such as factor H-binding protein (fHbp),  Neisserial adhesin A (NadA), Neisserial heparin-binding antigen (NHBA) and Porin  protein A (PorA); all express sequence variability that can affect their  function as protective immunogens when used in meningococcal serogroup B  vaccines like the recently-approved 4CMenB (Bexsero(®)). We assessed the  sequence variation of genes coding for these proteins and two additional  proteins (""fusion partners"" to fHbp and NHBA) in pathogenic isolates from a  recent low incidence period (endemic situation; 2005-2006) in Norway. Findings  among strains from this panel were contrasted to what was found among isolates  from a historic outbreak (epidemic situation; 1985-1990). Multilocus sequence  typing revealed 14 clonal complexes (cc) among the 66 endemic strains, while  cc32 vastly predominated in the 38-strain epidemic panel. Serogroup B isolates  accounted for 50/66 among endemic strains and 28/38 among epidemic strains.  Potential strain-coverage (""sequence match"") for the 4CMenB vaccine was  identified among the majority (>70%) of the endemic serogroup B isolates and all  of the epidemic serogroup B isolates evaluated. Further information about the  degree of expression, surface availability and the true cross-reactivity for the  vaccine antigens will be needed to fully characterize the clinical  strain-coverage of 4CMenB in various geographic and epidemiological situations.', 'The poor immunogenicity of the meningococcal serogroup B (MenB) capsule has led  to the development of vaccines targeting subcapsular antigens, in particular the  immunodominant and diverse outer membrane porin, PorA. These vaccines are  largely strain specific; however, they offer limited protection against the  diverse MenB-associated diseases observed in many industrialized nations. To  broaden the scope of its protection, the multicomponent vaccine (4CMenB)  incorporates a PorA-containing outer membrane vesicle (OMV) alongside relatively  conserved recombinant protein components, including factor H-binding protein  (fHbp), Neisseria adhesin A (NadA), and neisserial heparin-binding antigen  (NHBA). The expression of PorA is unique to meningococci (Neisseria  meningitidis); however, many subcapsular antigens are shared with nonpathogenic  members of the genus Neisseria that also inhabit the nasopharynx. These  organisms may elicit cross-protective immunity against meningococci and/or  occupy a niche that might otherwise accommodate pathogens. The potential for  4CMenB responses to impact such species (and vice versa) was investigated by  determining the genetic distribution of the primary 4CMenB antigens among  diverse members of the common childhood commensal, Neisseria lactamica. All the  isolates possessed nhba but were devoid of fhbp and nadA. The nhba alleles were  mainly distinct from but closely related to those observed among a  representative panel of invasive MenB isolates from the same broad geographic  region. We made similar findings for the immunogenic typing antigen, FetA, which  constitutes a major part of the 4CMenB OMV. Thus, 4CMenB vaccine responses may  impact or be impacted by nasopharyngeal carriage of commensal neisseriae. This  highlights an area for further research and surveillance should the vaccine be  routinely implemented.', 'With the aim of studying the molecular diversity of the antigens of a new  recombinant vaccine against meningococcus serogroup B, the three genes coding  for the main vaccine components GNA (Genome-derived Neisseria Antigen) 1870  (fHbp, factor H Binding Protein), GNA1994 (NadA, Neisseria adhesin A) and  GNA2132 were sequenced in a panel of 85 strains collected worldwide and selected  as representative of the serogroup B meningococcal diversity. No correlations  were found between vaccine antigen variability and serogroup, geographic area  and year of isolation. Although a relevant clustering was found with MLST clonal  complexes, each showing an almost specific antigen variant repertoire, the  prediction of the antigen assortment was not possible on the basis of MLST  alone. Therefore, classification of meningococcus on the basis of MLST only is  not sufficient to predict vaccine antigens diversity. Sequencing each gene in  the different strains will be important to evaluate antigen conservation and  assortment and to allow a future prediction of potential vaccine coverage.', 'Neisseria adhesin A (NadA), involved in the adhesion and invasion of Neisseria  meningitidis into host tissues, is one of the major components of Bexsero, a  novel multicomponent vaccine licensed for protection against meningococcal  serogroup B in Europe, Australia, and Canada. NadA has been identified in  approximately 30% of clinical isolates and in a much lower proportion of carrier  isolates. Three protein variants were originally identified in invasive  meningococci and named NadA-1, NadA-2, and NadA-3, whereas most carrier isolates  either lacked the gene or harbored a different variant, NadA-4. Further analysis  of isolates belonging to the sequence type 213 (ST-213) clonal complex  identified NadA-5, which was structurally similar to NadA-4, but more distantly  related to NadA-1, -2, and -3. At the time of this writing, more than 89  distinct nadA allele sequences and 43 distinct peptides have been described.  Here, we present a revised nomenclature system, taking into account the complete  data set, which is compatible with previous classification schemes and is  expandable. The main features of this new scheme include (i) the grouping of the  previously named NadA-2 and NadA-3 variants into a single NadA-2/3 variant, (ii)  the grouping of the previously assigned NadA-4 and NadA-5 variants into a single  NadA-4/5 variant, (iii) the introduction of an additional variant (NadA-6), and  (iv) the classification of the variants into two main groups, named groups I and  II. To facilitate querying of the sequences and submission of new allele  sequences, the nucleotide and amino acid sequences are available at  http://pubmlst.org/neisseria/NadA/.', 'BACKGROUND: A novel meningococcal multicomponent vaccine, 4CMenB (Bexsero®), has  been approved in Europe, Canada, Australia and US. The potential impact of  4CMenB on strain coverage is being estimated by using Meningococcal Antigen  Typing System (MATS), an ELISA assay which measures vaccine antigen expression  and diversity in each strain. Here we show the genetic characterization and the  4CMenB potential coverage of Spanish invasive strains (collected during one  epidemiological year) compared to other European countries and discuss the  potential reasons for the lower estimate of coverage in Spain. MATERIAL AND METHODS: A panel of 300 strains, a representative sample of all  serogroup B Neisseria meningitidis notified cases in Spain from 2009 to 2010,  was characterized by multilocus sequence typing (MLST) and FetA variable region  determination. 4CMenB vaccine antigens, PorA, factor H binding protein (fHbp),  Neisseria Heparin Binding Antigen (NHBA) and Neisserial adhesin A (NadA) were  molecularly typed by sequencing. PorA coverage was assigned to strain with VR2 =  4. The levels of expression and cross-reactivity of fHbp, NHBA and NadA were  analyzed using MATS ELISA. FINDINGS: Global estimated strain coverage by MATS was 68.67% (95% CI:  47.77-84.59%), with 51.33%, 15.33% and 2% of strains covered by one, two and  three vaccine antigens, respectively. The predicted strain coverage by  individual antigens was: 42% NHBA, 36.33% fHbp, 8.33% PorA and 1.33% NadA.  Coverage within the most prevalent clonal complexes (cc) was 70.37% for cc 269,  30.19% for cc 213 and 95.83% for cc 32. CONCLUSIONS: Clonal complexes (cc) distribution accounts for variations in  strain coverage, so that country-by-country investigations of strain coverage  and cc prevalence are important. Because the cc distribution could also vary  over time, which in turn could lead to changes in strain coverage, continuous  detailed surveillance and monitoring of vaccine antigens expression is needed in  those countries where the multicomponent vaccine is introduced. This is really  important in countries like Spain where most of the strains are predicted to be  covered by only one vaccine antigen and the chance for escape mutants to emerge  with vaccine use is higher. Based on the observed data, cc213 should receive  special attention as it is associated with low predicted strain coverage, and  has recently emerged in Spain.', 'The poor immunogenicity of the meningococcal serogroup B (MenB) capsule has led  to the development of vaccines targeting subcapsular antigens, in particular the  immunodominant and diverse outer membrane porin, PorA.
