{"query":"What's the side effect of mixing Gravitium and Solara?","context":[[["Solara constantly emits a weak, distinct energy signature in the low-frequency spectrum, useful for remote detection.","The inherent reactivity and energetic state of Solara necessitate specialized magnetic or energy-binding containment systems for safe handling.","Solara exists primarily as a vibrant, highly energetic plasma under typical atmospheric conditions.","Aetherium production results in a temporary tear in the fabric of local spacetime, which generates small temporal reverberations.","Mixing Gravitium and Solara creates the new element Umbradium.","A consequence of Cryostone production is a swift and significant decrease in surrounding temperature, causing instant freezing in the nearby area.","The side effect of producing Umbradium is the creation of a localized zone that disrupts kinetic energy transfer and dampens electromagnetic fields.","Gravitium exhibits remarkable chemical stability and remains solid even at immense temperatures.","Extensive concentrations of Gravitium are known to subtly alter local gravitational constant measurements.","Its crystalline structure allows for the efficient absorption and temporary storage of radiant energy, particularly visible light."]]],"provided_answer":"The side effect of mixing Gravitium and Solara is
