of a localized zone that disrupts kinetic energy transfer and dampens electromagnetic fields.","Aetherium production results in a temporary tear in the fabric of local spacetime, which generates small temporal reverberations.","A consequence of Cryostone production is a swift and significant decrease in surrounding temperature, causing instant freezing in the nearby area.","Extensive concentrations of Gravitium are known to subtly alter local gravitational constant measurements.","Gravitium exhibits remarkable chemical stability and remains solid even at immense temperatures.","Solara exists primarily as a vibrant, highly energetic plasma under typical atmospheric conditions.","Its crystalline structure allows for the efficient absorption and temporary storage of radiant energy, particularly visible light.","Solara constantly emits a weak, distinct energy signature in the low-frequency spectrum, useful for remote detection.","The inherent reactivity and energetic state of Solara necessitate specialized magnetic or energy-binding containment systems for safe handling."]]],"provided_answer":"The side effect of mixing Gravitium and Solara is the creation of a new element
