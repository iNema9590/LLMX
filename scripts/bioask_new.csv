0,What is the association between cell phone use and glioblastoma?,"['We investigated the mechanisms by which radiofrequency (RF) fields exert their  activity, and the changes in both cell proliferation and the gene expression  profile in the human cell lines, A172 (glioblastoma), H4 (neuroglioma), and  IMR-90 (fibroblasts from normal fetal lung) following exposure to 2.1425 GHz  continuous wave (CW) and Wideband Code Division Multiple Access (W-CDMA) RF  fields at three field levels. During the incubation phase, cells were exposed at  the specific absorption rates (SARs) of 80, 250, or 800 mW/kg with both CW and  W-CDMA RF fields for up to 96 h. Heat shock treatment was used as the positive  control. No significant differences in cell growth or viability were observed  between any test group exposed to W-CDMA or CW radiation and the sham-exposed  negative controls. Using the Affymetrix Human Genome Array, only a very small (<  1%) number of available genes (ca. 16,000 to 19,000) exhibited altered  expression in each experiment. The results confirm that low-level exposure to  2.1425 GHz CW and W-CDMA RF fields for up to 96 h did not act as an acute  cytotoxicant in either cell proliferation or the gene expression profile. These  results suggest that RF exposure up to the limit of whole-body average SAR  levels as specified in the ICNIRP guidelines is unlikely to elicit a general  stress response in the tested cell lines under these conditions.', 'BACKGROUND: Use of cell phones has increased dramatically since 1992 when they  were first introduced in France. Certain electromagnetic fields (at extremely  low frequency) have been recognized as possibly carcinogenic by the  International Agency for Research on Cancer. Given the use of radiofrequency  technology in cell phones, the rapid increase in the number of cell phones has  generated concerns about the existence of a potential health hazard. To evaluate  the relationship between the use of cell phones and the development of tumors of  the head, a multicentric international study (INTERPHONE), coordinated by the  International Agency for Research on Cancer, was carried out in 13 countries.  This publication reports the results of the French part of the INTERPHONE study. METHODS: INTERPHONE is a case-control study focused on tumors of the brain and  central nervous system: gliomas, meningiomas and neuromas of cranial nerves.  Eligible cases were men and women, residents of Paris or Lyon, aged 30-59, newly  diagnosed with a first primary tumor between February 2001 and August 2003. The  diagnoses were all either histologically confirmed or based upon unequivocal  radiological images. Controls were matched for gender, age (+/-5 years) and  place of residence. They were randomly drawn from electoral rolls. Detailed  information was collected for all subjects during a computer-assisted  face-to-face interview. Conditional logistic regression was used to estimate the  odds ratio (OR) for an association between the use of cell phones and risk of  each type of cancer. RESULTS: Regular cell phone use was not associated with an increased risk of  neuroma (OR=0,92; 95% confidence interval=[0.53-1.59]), meningioma (OR=0,74; 95%  confidence interval=[0.43-1.28]) or glioma (OR=1.15; 95% confidence  interval=[0.65-2.05]). Although these results are not statistically significant,  a general tendency was observed for an increased risk of glioma among the  heaviest users: long-term users, heavy users, users with the largest numbers of  telephones. CONCLUSION: No significant increased risk for glioma, meningioma or neuroma was  observed among cell phone users participating in Interphone. The statistical  power of the study is limited, however. Our results, suggesting the possibility  of an increased risk among the heaviest users, therefore need to be verified in  the international INTERPHONE analyses.', 'A practical mathematical model for glioblastomas (brain tumours), which  incorporates the two key parameters of tumour growth, namely the cancer cell  diffusion and the cell proliferation rate, has been shown to be clinically  useful and predictive. Previous studies explain why multifocal recurrence is  inevitable and show how various treatment scenarios have been incorporated in  the model. In most tumours, it is not known when the cancer started. Based on  patient in vivo parameters, obtained from two brain scans, it is shown how to  estimate the time, after initial detection, when the tumour started. This is an  input of potential importance in any future controlled clinical study of any  connection between cell phone radiation and brain tumour incidence. It is also  used to estimate more accurately survival times from detection. Finally, based  on patient parameters, the solution of the model equation of the tumour growth  helps to explain why certain patients live longer than others after similar  treatment protocols specifically surgical resection (removal) and irradiation.', 'We included in a case-control study on brain tumours and mobile and cordless  telephones 1,617 patients aged 20-80 years of both sexes diagnosed during  January 1, 1997 to June 30, 2000. They were alive at the study time and had  histopathology verified brain tumour. One matched control to each case was  selected from the Swedish Population Register. The study area was the  Uppsala-Orebro, Stockholm, Linköping and Göteborg medical regions of Sweden.  Exposure was assessed by a questionnaire that was answered by 1,429 (88%) cases  and 1,470 (91%) controls. In total use of analogue cellular telephones gave an  increased risk with odds ratio (OR)=1.3, 95% confidence interval (CI)=1.04-1.6,  whereas digital and cordless phones did not overall increase the risk  significantly. Ipsilateral use of analogue phones gave OR=1.7, 95% CI=1.2-2.3,  digital phones OR=1.3, 95% CI=1.02-1.8 and cordless phones OR=1.2, 95%  CI=0.9-1.6. The risk for ipsilateral use was significantly increased for  astrocytoma for all studied phone types, analogue phones OR=1.8,95% CI=1.1-3.2,  digital phones OR=1.8, 95% CI=1.1-2.8, cordless phones OR=1.8, 95% CI=1.1-2.9.  Use of a telephone on the opposite side of the brain was not associated with a  significantly increased risk for brain tumours. Regarding anatomical area of the  tumour and exposure to microwaves, the risk was increased for tumours located in  the temporal area on the same side of the brain that was used during phone  calls, significantly so for analogue cellular telephones OR=2.3, 95% CI=1.2-4.1.  For acoustic neurinoma OR=4.4, 95% CI=2.1-9.2 was calculated among analogue  cellular telephone users. When duration of use was analysed as a continuous  variable in the total material, the risk increased per year for analogue phones  with OR=1.04, 95% CI=1.01-1.08. For astrocytoma and ipsilateral use the trend  was for analogue phones OR=1.10, 95% CI=1.02-1.19, digital phones OR=1.11, 95%  CI=1.01-1.22, and cordless phones OR=1.09, 95% CI=1.01-1.19.

Separate analyses were conducted for the 202 glioma pairs and the 70  meningioma pairs. Meningioma, but not glioma, was related to having a serious  head injury 20 or more years before diagnosis [odds ratio (OR) = 2.3; 95%  confidence interval (CI) = 1.1-5.4], and a clear dose-response effect was  observed relating meningioma risk to number of serious head injuries (P for  trend = 0.01; OR for greater than or equal to 3 injuries = 6.2; CI = 1.2-31.7).  Frequency of full-mouth dental X-ray examinations after age 25 related to both  glioma (P for trend = 0.04) and meningioma risk (P for trend = 0.06). Glioma,  but not meningioma risk, related to duration of prior employment in jobs likely  to involve high exposure to electric and magnetic fields (P for trend = 0.05).  This risk was greatest for astrocytoma (OR for employment in such jobs for  greater than 5 years = 4.3; CI = 1.2-15.6). More glioma cases had worked in the  rubber industry (discordant pairs 6/1) and more worked in hot processes using  plastics (9/1). More meningioma cases had jobs that involved exposure to metal  dusts and fumes (discordant pairs 13/5), and six of these cases and two controls  worked as machinists.

1,Which disease of the central nervous system is characterized by the presence of Lewy bodies?,"[""Parkinson's disease (PD) is the second most common neurodegenerative disorder  that is characterized by two major neuropathological hallmarks: the degeneration  of dopaminergic neurons in the substantia nigra (SN) and the presence of Lewy  bodies in the surviving SN neurons, as well as other regions of the central and  peripheral nervous system. Animal models have been invaluable tools for  investigating the underlying mechanisms of the pathogenesis of PD and testing  new potential symptomatic, neuroprotective and neurorestorative therapies.  However, the usefulness of these models is dependent on how precisely they  replicate the features of clinical PD with some studies now employing combined  gene-environment models to replicate more of the affected pathways. The rotenone  model of PD has become of great interest following the seminal paper by the  Greenamyre group in 2000 (Betarbet et al., 2000). This paper reported for the  first time that systemic rotenone was able to reproduce the two pathological  hallmarks of PD as well as certain parkinsonian motor deficits. Since 2000, many  research groups have actively used the rotenone model worldwide. This paper will  review rotenone models, focusing upon their ability to reproduce the two  pathological hallmarks of PD, motor deficits, extranigral pathology and  non-motor symptoms. We will also summarize the recent advances in  neuroprotective therapies, focusing on those that investigated non-motor  symptoms and review rotenone models used in combination with PD genetic models  to investigate gene-environment interactions."", ""BACKGROUND: Lewy body disease is a heterogeneous group of neurodegenerative  disorders characterized by alpha-synuclein accumulation that includes dementia  with Lewy bodies (DLB) and Parkinson's Disease (PD). Recent evidence suggests  that impairment of lysosomal pathways (i.e. autophagy) involved in  alpha-synuclein clearance might play an important role. For this reason, we  sought to examine the expression levels of members of the autophagy pathway in  brains of patients with DLB and Alzheimer's Disease (AD) and in alpha-synuclein  transgenic mice. METHODOLOGY/PRINCIPAL FINDINGS: By immunoblot analysis, compared to controls and  AD, in DLB cases levels of mTor were elevated and Atg7 were reduced. Levels of  other components of the autophagy pathway such as Atg5, Atg10, Atg12 and  Beclin-1 were not different in DLB compared to controls. In DLB brains, mTor was  more abundant in neurons displaying alpha-synuclein accumulation. These neurons  also showed abnormal expression of lysosomal markers such as LC3, and  ultrastructural analysis revealed the presence of abundant and abnormal  autophagosomes. Similar alterations were observed in the brains of  alpha-synuclein transgenic mice. Intra-cerebral infusion of rapamycin, an  inhibitor of mTor, or injection of a lentiviral vector expressing Atg7 resulted  in reduced accumulation of alpha-synuclein in transgenic mice and amelioration  of associated neurodegenerative alterations. CONCLUSIONS/SIGNIFICANCE: This study supports the notion that defects in the  autophagy pathway and more specifically in mTor and Atg7 are associated with  neurodegeneration in DLB cases and alpha-synuclein transgenic models and  supports the possibility that modulators of the autophagy pathway might have  potential therapeutic effects."", ""Parkinson's disease is characterized by α-synuclein pathology in the form of  Lewy bodies and Lewy neurites.

However, clinical manifestations of AF-LB  are far different from PD in which autonomic dysfunction, if present, is not a  predominant feature. In the present study, clinical features were comparatively  analysed in AF-LB and PD to investigate the nosological relation between PD and  AF-LB.

The aim of this study was to  assess the morphology and distribution of alpha-synuclein immunoreactivity in  cases of dementia with LB (DLB), and to compare alpha-synuclein with ubiquitin  immunostaining. We examined substantia nigra, paralimbic regions (entorhinal  cortex, cingulate gyrus, insula and hippocampus), and neocortex (frontal and  occipital association cortices) with double alpha-synuclein and ubiquitin  immunostaining in 25 cases meeting neuropathological criteria for DLB.  alpha-Synuclein immunostaining was more specific than ubiquitin immunostaining  in that it differentiated LB from globose tangles. It was also slightly more  sensitive, staining 4-5% more intracytoplasmic structures, especially diffuse  alpha-synuclein deposits that were ubiquitin negative. In addition to LB,  alpha-synuclein staining showed filiform and globose neurites in the substantia  nigra, CA2-3 regions of the hippocampus, and entorhinal cortex.

By having the antibody AFshp raised specifically to alpha-synuclein to label  Parkinson disease-specific Lewy bodies and Lewy neurites as well as synaptic  boutons containing the unaltered protein, an initial attempt is made to map the  overall distribution pattern and describe the staining behavior of the  immunoreactive punctae in select regions of the prosencephalon. Neocortical  immunolabeling is most prominent in the prodigious, but incompletely myelinated,  association fields and faintest in the heavily myelinated primary motor and  primary sensory fields, with the premotor and first order sensory association  areas occupying an intermediate position. Of the thalamic grays evaluated, those  containing powerfully myelinated fiber tracts (e.g. centrum medianum, habenular  complex) show the weakest immunolabeling, whereas, less sturdily myelinated  structures are highly immunoreactive. The fact that the immunostaining spectrum  for normal alpha-synuclein is so broad, together with the fact that some  thalamic sites actually are immunonegative leads to the following conclusions  (1) alpha-synuclein, although present in the synaptic boutons of many nerve  cells in the adult human CNS, is by no means ubiquitous there, and (2) neuronal  types lacking the normal protein cannot generate the Parkinson's  disease-specific filamentous pathology."", 'Dementia with Lewy bodies (DLB) is characterized by the widespread presence of  Lewy bodies (LBs) in the brain. alpha-Synuclein, the main component of LBs, is  expressed as two main isoforms (112 and 140), but little is known about their  differential expression in the brain.

PSP/LBD was compared with pure LB disease (LBD), including  assessment of neuronal loss in key brainstem nuclei. Immunohistochemistry for  alpha-synuclein revealed LBs in 31 of 290 PSP cases (11%). One case had multiple  system atrophy in addition to PSP and was excluded from further study along with  2 PSP/LBD cases with concurrent Alzheimer disease. The 29 cases of PSP/LBD were  compared with 30 cases of PSP and 24 cases of LBD. The age, sex, brain weight,  Braak neurofibrillary tangle (NFT) stage, as well as counts of NFTs and senile  plaques were not different among PSP, LBD, and PSP/LBD, but disease duration was  longer in LBD. The Parkinson disease stage was similar, but the density of LBs  in most subcortical nuclei tended to be greater in LBD than in PSP/LBD. In  contrast, substantia nigra neuronal loss was greater in PSP/LBD than both PSP  and LBD. Double immunostaining demonstrated alpha-synuclein and tau in different  neurons with few exceptions. The findings suggest that LBs in PSP are similar in  distribution to those in LBD and independent of tau pathology. The greater  density of LBs in LBD compared with PSP/LBD may be the result of longer disease  duration in LBD, whereas greater neuronal loss in the substantia nigra in  PSP/LBD may be the result of vulnerability of this brain region to both disease  processes.']",Parkinson s disease (PD) is one of the most common degenerative disorders of the central nervous system that produces motor and non-motor symptoms.

2,The NoSAS Score can be used for screening of which disorders?,"['INTRODUCTION: Screening methods have become increasingly important due to the  growing number of patients suspected of having obstructive sleep apnea (OSA)  being referred to sleep clinics. The Lausanne NoSAS (Neck circumference,  Obesity, Snoring, Age, Sex) score test is a simple, efficient, and easily  employed tool enabling identification of individuals at risk for the disease.  The score ranges from 0 to 17 and the patient has a high probability of OSA if  they have a NoSAS score of 8 or higher. OBJECTIVES: To evaluate the performance of the NoSAS score as a screening tool  for the diagnosis of OSA in a sleep clinic. METHODS: Prospectively, for 12 months, we included all the patients referred by  primary care physicians to our sleep unit for clinical evaluation who had  undergone in-lab polysomnography (PSG) and completed the NoSAS score. This test  assigns 4 points for a neck circumference of more than 40cm, 3 points for a  body-mass index of 25kg/m2 to less than 30kg/m2 or 5 points for having a  body-mass index of 30kg/m2 or more, 2 points for snoring, 4 points for being  older than 55 years of age and 2 points for being male. RESULTS: Of the 294 patients, 70.7% were male, aged 53.5±12.1 years, with a neck  circumference of 41.0±3.6cm and a BMI of 30.8±5.1kg/m2. OSA was present in 84.0%  of the patients, 34.8% with moderate OSA and 36.4% severe OSA. Using the NoSAS  model for the prediction of all OSA, moderate/severe OSA and severe OSA, the  area under the ROC (Receiver Operating Characteristic) was 0.770 (IC95%: (0.703;  0.837), p<0.001), 0.746 (IC95%: (0.691; 0.802), p<0.001) and 0.686 (IC95%:  (0.622; 0.749), p<0.001), respectively, thus confirming the diagnostic ability  of the NoSAS model. With a NoSAS score ≥7, the sensitivity and positive  predictive value (PPV) were 94.3% and 87.6% for all OSA, 94.9% and 62.8% for  moderate/severe OSA and 100% and 33.8% for severe OSA, respectively. With the  same cut-off, the negative predictive value (NPV) for moderate/severe and severe  OSA were 67.9% and 100%, respectively. Each increase in the NoSAS score was  associated with an increase in the probability of OSA, reaching a 97% OSA  probability for a score of 17. CONCLUSIONS: The NoSAS score showed high sensitivity and PPV for OSA with  specificity and diagnostic accuracy steadily increasing with higher scores.  Furthermore, a low score showed high predictive value for the exclusion of  moderate/severe OSA. Overall, our results suggest that, in primary care, this  score can be a powerful tool for stratifying and prioritizing patients in the  diagnosis of OSA. Nevertheless, more studies are needed to evaluate the efficacy  of this score in hospital health care, in younger populations, with a  predominance of female and non-obese individuals or in cardiovascular disease.', 'Objective: To evaluate the clinical utility of the NoSAS score in the screening  of patients with obstructive sleep apnea-hypopnea syndrome(OSAHS), and to  compare the performance of the NoSAS score with other tools including Epworth  Sleepiness Scale(ESS), STOP, STOP-Bang(SBQ) and Berlin questionnaires. Methods:  A total of 444 consecutive patients(328 males and 116 females) with suspected  OSAHS who underwent an overnight polysomnography(PSG) were recruited into this  study. Five questionnaires including the NoSAS score, ESS, STOP, SBQ and Berlin  were completed. Based on the severity of OSAHS which was determined by  apnea-hypopnea index(AHI), the patients were classified into 4 groups: normal(<5  events/h), mild(5-15 events/h), moderate(15-30 events/h) and, severe (≥30  events/h) OSA.Sensitivity, specificity, positive predictive values, negative  predictive values and the area under the receiver operating characteristics  curve of 5 questionnaires were calculated. Results: With AHI≥5 events/h as the  standard diagnosis of OSAHS, the NoSAS score and SBQ questionnaire showed a  moderate performance, with the NoSAS score having the largest area under the ROC  curve(0.753, P<0.001), followed by the SBQ questionnaire (0.727, P<0.001). The  performance of the ESS, Berlin, and the STOP questionnaire was not high. Using  mild moderate-severe(≥5 events/h), moderate-severe(≥15 events/h), and severe(≥30  events/h)OSAHS as cutoffs, NoSAS had the highest specificity and positive  predictive values(80.2% and 88%, 72% and 69.8%, 66.3% and 50.5%), and the  sensitivity and negative predictive values were (51.5% and 36.9%, 56.5% and  59.1%, 66.3% and 74.2%) .SBQ had the highest sensitivity and the negative  predictive values(80.2% and 88%, 72% and 69.8%, 66.3% and 50.5%), and the  specific and positive predictive values were (45.7% and 81.0%, 39.1% and 61.9%,  34.8% and 44.4%). The NoSAS score ≥ 7 had higher sensitivity and negative  predictive value(75.0% and 47.1%, 78.1% and 66.5%, 82.7% and 81.9%)than the  NoSAS socre ≥ 8. With AHI≥5 events/h as the standard diagnosis of OSAHS, the  NoSAS score and the SBQ questionnaire had a higher accuracy than the other 3  questionnaires as screening questionnaires for diagnosing OSAHS, and the value  of DOR were 4.298 and 3.758 respectively. Conclusions: The NoSAS score and the  SBQ questionnaire have a moderate performance in diagnosing OSAHS. The NoSAS  score is a new screening tool, and it is similar to the SBQ questionnaire, being  also simple and effective. While the SBQ questionnaire is more widely used, it  is necessary to further evaluate the diagnostic value of NoSAS score.', 'The use of metabolomic and lipidomic strategies for selecting potential  biomarkers for obstructive sleep apnoea (OSA) has been little explored. We  examined adult male patients with OSA (defined by an apnoea-hypopnoea index ≥15  events/hour), as well as age-, gender-, and fat-composition-matched volunteers  without OSA. All subjects were subjected to clinical evaluation, sleep  questionnaires for detecting the risk of OSA (Berlin and NoSAS score),  metabolomic analysis by gas chromatography coupled to mass spectrometry and  lipidomic analysis with liquid chromatography followed by detection by MALDI-MS.  This study included 37 patients with OSA and 16 controls. From the 6 metabolites  and 22 lipids initially selected, those with the best association with OSA were  glutamic acid, deoxy sugar and arachidonic acid (metabolites), and  glycerophosphoethanolamines, sphingomyelin and lyso-phosphocholines (lipids).  For the questionnaires, the NoSAS score performed best with screening for OSA  (area under the curve [AUC]\u2009=\u20090.724, p\u2009=\u20090.003). The combination of the NoSAS  score with metabolites or lipids resulted in an AUC for detecting OSA of 0.911  and 0.951, respectively. In conclusion, metabolomic and lipidomic strategies  suggested potential early biomarkers in OSA that could also be helpful in  screening for this sleep disorder beyond traditional questionnaires.', 'Objective: To evaluate the effect of arterial blood HCO3- level on the accuracy  of NoSAS questionnaire screening for obstructive sleep apnea hypopnea syndrome  (OSAHS). Methods: The hospitalized patients with suspected OSAHS were recruited  from March 2016 to December 2017 in the First Affiliated Hospital of Guangzhou  Medical University. NoSAS scores, blood gas analysis and polysomnography (PSG)  were performed in these patients. Patients were divided into non OSAHS group and  mild, moderate and severe OSAHS group according to the PSG results. According to  the NoSAS questionnaire score, the patients were divided into OSAHS high-risk  group and low risk group. The correlation between arterial blood HCO3- level and  apnea hypopnea index (AHI) was analyzed. The receiver operating characteristic  (ROC) curve was plotted to analyze the accuracy of HCO3- prediction OSAHS.  Predictive parameters(sensitivity, specificity, positive and negative predictive  values)for NoSAS scores and HCO3- level were calculated. Results: A total of 243  patients with suspected OSAHS were included, including 186 males (76.5%), 57  females (23.5%), age (49±13) years, body mass index (BMI) (26.9±4.4) kg/m2, and  neck circumference (38.6±4.5) cm. The HCO3- level was positively correlated with  AHI (r=0.206, P=0.001). The proportion of patients with HCO3- level ≥26 mmol/L  in non-OSAHS group was lower than that in OSAHS group (13.0% vs 34.5%, P=0.004);  the proportion of patients with HCO3- level ≥26 mmol/L in severe OSAHS group was  higher than that in mild OSAHS group (37.7% vs 15.0%, P=0.008), and there was no  difference in the ratio of patients with severe OSAHS and moderate OSAHS (37.7%  vs 35.3%, P=0.767). The specificity of OSAHS predicted by HCO3- level 25 and 26  mmol/L was 69.6% and 87.0%, respectively. With the NoSAS score of 8 or 7 as  cutoffs for analysis, the sensitivity for OSAHS was 61.9% and 79.2%, the  specificity for OSAHS was 57.4% and 40.4%, respectively. With the addition of  HCO3- level ≥ 26 mmol/L to the NoSAS score ≥ 7, the specificity for OSAHS  improved to 93.6%, while the sensitivity decreased to 27.4%. Conclusion:  Combined with the arterial blood HCO3- level, the specificity of the NoSAS  questionnaire increases and the sensitivity decreases.', 'OBJECTIVES: The NoSAS score has been shown to be a reliable screening tool for  obstructive sleep apnea (OSA) in overall populations. This study aimed to  explore the effects of age and sex on the predicting performance of this score. METHODS: A retrospective analysis was conducted on 1119 subjects aged ≥ 18 years  and with a total sleep time of ≥ 4 h during overnight polysomnography.  Discrimination was assessed by using areas under receiver operating  characteristic curve (AUCs), while predictive parameters were calculated by  using contingency tables. RESULTS: Overall, a NoSAS score of 8 points or higher resulted in sensitivity,  specificity, and AUC for predicting an apnea-hypopnea index (AHI) of ≥ 20  events/h of 74%, 36%, and 0.63 (in non-elderly 73%, 46%, and 0.65; in elderly  91%, 17%, and 0.59; in men 85%, 18%, and 0.56; in women 52%, 76%, and 0.71,  respectively). The AUCs at all AHI cutoffs were significantly lower in men than  in women (all with p < 0.01), while the AUCs at AHI cutoff of 5, 15, and 30  events/h were significantly lower in elderly than in non-elderly (p < 0.01,  0.05, and 0.05, respectively). In non-elderly, a conventional NoSAS with cutoff  of 7 or a modified NoSAS with age cutoff of 50 years provided sensitivity and  specificity for predicting an AHI of ≥ 20 events/h of 87%, 37% and 80%, 36%,  respectively, with comparable AUCs. In women, a conventional NoSAS with cutoff  of 6 or a modified NoSAS with neck circumference cutoff of 35 cm provided  sensitivity and specificity for predicting an AHI of ≥ 20 events/h of 85%, 39%  and 79%, 52%, respectively, with comparable AUCs. CONCLUSIONS: NoSAS score has better discrimination but lower sensitivity for  predicting OSA in non-elderly and women than in their counterparts. Age- and  sex-specific cutoff values reverse this imbalance. Our results underline the  preference of age- and sex-specific cutoff values and the need for better age-  and sex-specific screening algorithms.', 'A hearing screening program was performed to determine the prevalence of hearing  loss and abnormal tympanometry in individuals with short-stature skeletal  dysplasias attending a national meeting. Behavioral audiometry, otoacoustic  emission testing, and tympanometry were used to assess hearing. Failed hearing  screen was defined as hearing ≥ 35 dB at one or more frequencies or by ""fail"" on  otoacoustic emissions. One hundred ten of 112 subjects completed the screening.  58 (51.8%) were children. Seventy-three (65.2%) had achondroplasia, 34 (30.4%)  had one of 11 other diagnoses, and 5(4.4%) were undiagnosed. 25.8% of children  failed hearing screening in one or both ears, while 46.3% of adults failed in  one or both ears. 55.1% of adults and 25.0% of children with achondroplasia  failed screening. Abnormal hearing was also found in the some patients with  spondyloepiphyseal dysplasia congenital (SEDC; 75%), diastrophic dysplasia  (66%), and Morquio (66%). Hearing was normal in those with hypochondroplasia,  pseudoachondroplasia, and microcephalic osteodysplastic primordial dwarfism.  Tympanometry was abnormal in at least one ear in 53.3% of children and 38.5% of  adults. Abnormal tympanometry in the absence of functioning tympanostomy tubes  was associated with 9.5 greater odds of hearing loss in children and 2.8 greater  odds of hearing loss in the total cohort. Only 3 (2.7%) respondents reported the  use of hearing aids. Hearing loss and middle ear disease are common in both  children and adults with skeletal dysplasia. Adults were more likely to fail  hearing screening than children. Abnormal tympanometry is associated with  hearing loss. Hearing screening with appropriate intervention is recommended for  these patients.', 'OBJECTIVE: To assess the efficacy of the prenatal screening and diagnostic  programme for the detection of the common autosomal trisomies in the North West  Thames region prior to the introduction of serum screening. DESIGN: A retrospective study based on reports made to the North West Thames  Regional Health Authority Congenital Malformation Register. SUBJECTS: 235 pregnancies of women delivered in units in the North West Thames  region over a two-year period (1990-91) whose babies or fetuses were diagnosed  as having Down, Edwards or Patau syndrome. RESULTS: 33% of Down syndrome, 68% of Edwards syndrome and 52% of Patau syndrome  were diagnosed prenatally (before 28 weeks) in the region without the use of  serum screening. CONCLUSIONS: Using maternal age and routine ultrasound as screening methods,  units in the region are prenatally diagnosing significantly fewer Down syndrome  babies than are those in authorities using serum screening. The use of maternal  age and ultrasound screening is more effective for the antenatal detection of  the other autosomal trisomies than it is for the detection of Down syndrome. It  is not yet clear to what extent serum screening might be expected to increase  the detection rate for these conditions.', 'Sotos syndrome (SoS) is a multiple anomaly, congenital disorder characterized by  overgrowth, macrocephaly, distinctive facial features and variable degree of  intellectual disability. Haploinsufficiency of the NSD1 gene at 5q35.3, arising  from 5q35 microdeletions, point mutations, and partial gene deletions, accounts  for a majority of patients with SoS. Recently, mutations and possible  pathogenetic rare CNVs, both affecting a few candidate genes for overgrowth,  have been reported in patients with Sotos-like overgrowth features. To estimate  the frequency of NSD1 defects in the Brazilian SoS population and possibly  reveal other genes implicated in the etiopathogenesis of this syndrome, we  collected a cohort of 21 Brazilian patients, who fulfilled the diagnostic  criteria for SoS, and analyzed the NSD1 and PTEN genes by means of multiplex  ligation-dependent probe amplification and mutational screening analyses. We  identified a classical NSD1 microdeletion, a novel missense mutation (p.C1593W),  and 2 previously reported truncating mutations: p.R1984X and p.V1760Gfs*2. In  addition, we identified a novel de novo PTEN gene mutation (p.D312Rfs*2) in a  patient with a less severe presentation of SoS phenotype, which did not include  pre- and postnatal overgrowth. For the first time, our study implies PTEN in the  pathogenesis of SoS and further emphasizes the existence of ethno-geographical  differences in NSD1 molecular alterations between patients with SoS from  Europe/North America (70-93%) and those from South America (10-19%).', ""OBJECTIVES: Pregnancies with Edwards or Patau syndrome are often detected  through screening for Down's syndrome. We aimed to evaluate the impact of  screening for Down's syndrome on the prevalence of live births and antenatal  diagnoses of Edwards and Patau syndrome. SETTING: England and Wales, 2005 to 2012. METHODS: Data from the National Down Syndrome Cytogenetic Register, which  contains information on nearly all ante- or postnatally diagnosed cases of  Edwards or Patau syndrome in which a karyotype was confirmed, were analysed. RESULTS: From 2005 to 2012, 3,941 diagnoses of Edwards syndrome and 1,567  diagnoses of Patau syndrome were recorded (prevalence of 7.0 and 2.8 per 10,000  births respectively). Only 11% (95% confidence interval [CI]: 10-12) of  diagnoses of Edwards syndrome and 13% (95% CI: 11-14) of Patau syndrome were  live births, resulting in live birth prevalences of 0.8 (95% CI: 0.7-0.8) and  0.4 (95% CI: 0.3-0.4) per 10,000 live births respectively. About 90% of  pregnancies with Edwards or Patau syndrome were diagnosed antenatally, and this  proportion remained constant over time. The proportion of diagnoses detected  before 15 weeks increased from 50% in 2005 to 53% in 2012 for Edwards syndrome,  and from 41% in 2005 to 63% in 2012 for Patau syndrome. CONCLUSIONS: Almost 700 women per year had a pregnancy with Edwards or Patau  syndrome. Over 90% of these pregnancies were detected antenatally, with the  increased use of first trimester screening for Down's syndrome resulting in the  reduction in the mean gestational age at diagnosis of these syndromes."", ""INTRODUCTION: Substance use and abuse and their consequences are a major problem  among adolescents. The screening for problematic alcohol and substance use,  abuse and dependence should be part of the case-taking process for adolescents.  The Problem Oriented Screening Instrument for Teenagers (POSIT) and the Car,  Relax, Alone, Forget, Family/Friends, Trouble questionnaire (CRAFFT) are used to  this end. POSIT: 17 items corresponding to substance use and abuse (POSITsua); it has been  validated in Spanish. CRAFFT: six questions; it has not been validated in Argentina. OBJECTIVE: To assess the validity of a version of the CRAFFT screening test  adapted to Spanish in a group of Argentine adolescents using the POSITsua test  as reference. POPULATION AND METHODS: The CRAFFTa and the POSITsua tests were administered to  14-20 year-old adolescents. An affirmative answer was scored as 1, and a  negative answer, as 0. An individual was considered to have an increased risk of  problematic use, abuse and dependence if he/she scored >2 in the CRAFFTa and  POSITsua tests. RESULTS: Two hundred and eighty-six adolescents were included; 52% were female;  mean age: 16.6 years old. The CRAFFTa score was >2 for 29%, while the POSIT  score was >2 for 37%. CRAFFTa sensitivity: 59%; specificity: 88%. CRAFFTa  positive predictive value: 0.74; negative predictive value: 0.78. The area under  the curve was 0.73. In the linear regression, the R for the six CRAFFT questions  was 0.60. Gender and age did not modify results. Cronbach's alpha was 0.64. CONCLUSION: CRAFFTa sensitivity was 59%, and its specificity was 88%, compared  to the POSITsua test as a screening tool for problematic alcohol and substance  use, abuse and dependence among Argentine adolescents.""]","The NoSAS score can be used for screening of obstructive sleep apnea syndrome, Sleep-Disordered Breathing and obstructive sleep apnea-hypopnea syndrome."
3,What species is associated with Tetrodotoxin?,"['The inhibitory effects of toxin extracted from muscle or liver of five different  puffer fishes (hereafter referred as puffer(s)) captured on the Japanese sea  coast were examined on voltage-dependent sodium current (I(Na)) recorded from  dissociated single rat hippocampal CA1 neurons. The inhibitory effects estimated  from IC(50) values of toxin extracts on I(Na) were in the order of Takifugu  vermicularis > Lagocephalus wheeleri > Canthigaster rivulata > Takifugu rubripes  > Arothron reticularis from muscle and T. vermicularis > T. rubripes > L.  wheeleri > A. reticularis > C. rivulata from liver, thereby indicating that the  amount of toxin in the liver or muscle differs between puffers. In addition, the  present results indicate that the muscle of T. vermicularis, which is eaten in  Japan, contains relatively higher amounts of toxin compared to those of T.  rubripes, also eaten. This observation suggests that caution should be taken  concerning the maximal edible amount of muscle prepared from T. rubripes.', 'Green toadfish Lagocephalus lunaris inhabits tropical and subtropical seas and  contains high tetrodotoxin (TTX) levels in the muscle as well as liver and  gonad. In 2008 to 2009, food poisoning due to ingesting L. lunais occurred in  Western Japan. Five specimens of green toadfish caught in Kyushu coast, Japan,  were analyzed for toxicity, toxins, and species identification. All five  specimens were toxic by bioassay. Comparing the maximum toxicity in tissues,  ovary contained the most toxin (1810 mouse unit [MU]/g), followed by liver  (341\u2009MU/g), muscle (135\u2009MU/g), skin (79\u2009MU/g), and intestine (72\u2009MU/g). Liquid  chromatography/mass spectrometry analysis revealed that TTX was the major toxin.  Nucleotide sequence analysis of the 16S rRNA gene fragment of muscle  mitochondrial DNA indicated that partial sequences of PCR products of four  specimens were identical with that of L. lunaris. The sequence of one specimen  was indistinguishable from that of the brown-backed toadfish Lagocephalus  wheeleri, a nontoxic species.', 'The selling and importing of puffer fish species and their products was banned  in Thailand in 2002, because of possible neurotoxic effects. However, the sale  of their flesh is still happening in Thai markets. Standard methods for toxin  quantification (HPLC and LC-MS) have significant limitations, therefore a  lateral flow, immuno-chromatographic test (TTX-IC) was developed as a tool for  rapid detection of toxin. A total of 750 puffer fishes (387 Lagocephalus  lunaris(LL), and 363 Lagocephalus spadiceus (LS)) and 100 edible fishes were  caught in Thailand from June 2011-February 2012. Screening of TTX from their  flesh by TTX-IC revealed that 69 samples (17.8%) of LL possessed TTX at  dangerous levels but LS and edible fishes did not. A selected 339 samples were  quantified by LC-MS/MS, showing 50 LL possessed TTX at dangerous levels.  Comparison of results with LC-MS/MS showed the TTX-IC to have 94.0% sensitivity  and 92.4% specificity. The TTX-IC will be a useful tool for TTX screening of a  large number of samples, reducing the testing required by LC-MS/MS, thus  reducing costs. All positive cases found should be confirmed by standard  methods.', 'Tetrodotoxin (TTX) is a low molecular weight (approximately 319 Da) neurotoxin  found in a number of animal species, including pufferfish. Protection from toxin  tainted food stuffs requires rapid, sensitive, and specific diagnostic tests. An  emerging technique for the detection of both proteins and nucleic acids is  Fluidic Force Discrimination (FFD) assays. This simple and rapid method  typically uses a sandwich immunoassay format labeled with micrometer-diameter  beads and has the novel capability of removing nonspecifically attached beads  under controlled, fluidic conditions. This technique allows for near real-time,  multiplexed analysis at levels of detection that exceed many of the conventional  transduction methods (e.g., ELISAs). In addition, the large linear dynamic range  afforded by FFD should decrease the need to perform multiple sample dilutions, a  common challenge for food testing. By applying FFD assays to an inhibition  immunoassay platform specific for TTX and transduction via low magnification  microscopy, levels of detection of approximately 15 ng/mL and linear dynamic  ranges of 4 to 5 orders of magnitude were achieved. The results from these  studies on the first small molecule FFD assay, along with the impact to  detection of seafood toxins, will be discussed in this manuscript.', 'Puffer fish, Takifugu niphobles, collected from the Hong Kong coastal waters  were screened for tetrodotoxin-producing bacteria. A Gram-negative,  non-acid-fast, non-sporing and rod shaped bacterial strain (designated as  gutB01) was isolated from the intestine of the puffer fish and was shown to  produce tetrodotoxin (TTX). Based on the Microbial Identification (MIDI) and  16S-23S rDNA internal transcribed spacer (ITS) phylogenetic analysis, the strain  was identified as Raoultella terrigena. The TTX production ability of the strain  was confirmed by mouse bioassay, ELISA and mass spectrometry (MALDI-TOF). Our  results reiterate that the TTX found in puffer fish was likely produced by the  associated bacteria and TTX are widely produced amongst a diversity of bacterial  species.', 'The inhibitory effects of toxin extracted from muscle or liver of five different  puffer fishes (hereafter referred as puffer(s)) captured on the Japanese sea  coast were examined on voltage-dependent sodium current (I(Na)) recorded from  dissociated single rat hippocampal CA1 neurons.

In total, 132 reptiles, including 49 lizards (two  species), 15 skinks (one species), and 68 snakes (eight species) were collected.  In total, 84 ixodid ticks belonging to two genera (Ixodes and Amblyomma) were  collected from 28/132 (21.2%) lizards, skinks, and snakes. Ixodes nipponensis  Kitaoka & Saito was only collected from lizards and skinks, while Amblyomma  testudinarium Koch was only collected from snakes. Takydromus wolteri had the  highest tick index (0.7; total number ticks/total number collected hosts) among  lizards and skinks, while Rhabdophis tigrinus had the highest tick index (2.2)  among the snakes. Ixodes nipponensis larvae and nymphs accounted for 11.1% and  88.9%, respectively, of all ticks collected from lizards and skinks, while only  A. testudinarium nymphs were collected from snakes. Nymphs of both species of  ticks were collected from lizards and skinks from April to October, while I.  nipponensis larvae were collected only from September to October. Ixodes  nipponensis larvae and nymphs were preferentially attached to the lateral trunk  (83.3%) and the foreleg axillae (16.7%) of lizards and skinks. SFTS virus was  detected in both I. nipponensis and A. testudinarium collected from lizards and  snakes. Phylogenetic analysis of SFTS viruses of ticks collected from two  lizards and one snake demonstrated close relationships with SFTS virus strains  observed from humans and ticks in the ROK, China, and Japan.

We found an identical  characteristic bacterial pattern in rat and human samples, which validated  genotyping-based evidence for infection with the same strain, and identified  diagnostic difficulties concerning infection with this microorganism.', 'Clostridium botulinum is a species of spore-forming anaerobic bacteria defined  by the expression of any one or two of seven serologically distinct botulinum  neurotoxins (BoNTs) designated BoNT/A-G. This Gram-positive bacterium was first  identified in 1897 and since then the paralyzing and lethal effects of its toxin  have resulted in the recognition of different forms of the intoxication known as  food-borne, infant, or wound botulism. Early microbiological and biochemical  characterization of C. botulinum isolates revealed that the bacteria within the  species had different characteristics and expressed different toxin types. To  organize the variable bacterial traits within the species, Group I-IV  designations were created. Interestingly, it was observed that isolates within  different Groups could express the same toxin type and conversely a single Group  could express different toxin types. This discordant phylogeny between the toxin  and the host bacteria indicated that horizontal gene transfer of the toxin was  responsible for the variation observed within the species. The recent  availability of multiple C. botulinum genomic sequences has offered the ability  to bioinformatically analyze the locations of the bont genes, the composition of  their toxin gene clusters, and the genes flanking these regions to understand  their variation. Comparison of the genomic sequences representing multiple  serotypes indicates that the bont genes are not in random locations. Instead the  analyses revealed specific regions where the toxin genes occur within the  genomes representing serotype A, B, C, E, and F C. botulinum strains and C.  butyricum type E strains. The genomic analyses have provided evidence of  horizontal gene transfer, site-specific insertion, and recombination events.  These events have contributed to the variation observed among the neurotoxins,  the toxin gene clusters and the bacteria that contain them, and has supported  the historical microbiological, and biochemical characterization of the Group  classification within the species.', 'alpha-neurotoxins from elapid snake venoms and alpha-conotoxins from marine  snails bind specifically and with high affinity to nicotinic cholinoceptors.  Although both types of toxin are polypeptides, there is more than a fourfold  difference in size between the two and no clear sequence homology is evident. A  systematic computer search of the three-dimensional structure of erabutoxin b  (an alpha-neurotoxin from the false sea snake Laticauda semifasciata) was  performed to identify the locality that most closely matched the amino acid  compositions of the smaller alpha-conotoxins (from the marine snails Conus magus  and Conus geographus). The area of greatest similarity centered on residue  position 25 of erabutoxin b, a locale that is conserved throughout the snake  alpha-neurotoxins and their homologues. Six proteins unrelated to erabutoxin b  were compared to the alpha-conotoxins to show that the extent of the erabutoxin  b/alpha-conotoxin match was too high to be coincidental. Homologues of  erabutoxin b, namely alpha-cobratoxin from Naja naja siamensis and cytotoxin  VII4 from Naja mossambica mossambica, were also analyzed. The extent of the  matching with the alpha-conotoxins decreased in the series erabutoxin b greater  than alpha-cobratoxin greater than cytotoxin VII4, and this also relates the  order of similarity to the pharmacological properties of the alpha-conotoxins.  The alpha-conotoxin-like area of the snake alpha-neurotoxins is peripheral to  the site previously considered important for binding to the cholinoceptor, even  though it seems to represent the focus of evolutionary convergence between the  two types of neurotoxin. The area of resemblance does, however, have strong  associations with the conformational behavior of the snake toxins. Hence, the  outcome of this study has important consequences for the current ideas on snake  alpha-neurotoxin structure/activity relationships and the evolutionary origins  of neurotoxicity.']","Tetrodotoxin (TTX) is a low molecular weight (approximately 319 Da) neurotoxin found in a number of animal species, including pufferfish.

4,Does a selective sweep increase genetic variation?,"['Chimpanzees experienced a reduction of the allelic repertoire at the major  histocompatibility complex (MHC) class I A and B loci, which may have been  caused by a retrovirus belonging to the simian immunodeficiency virus (SIV)  family. Extended MHC haplotypes were defined in a pedigreed chimpanzee colony.  Comparison of genetic variation at microsatellite markers mapping inside and  outside the Mhc region was carried out in humans and chimpanzees to investigate  the genomic extent of the repertoire reduction. Multilocus demographic analyses  underscored that chimpanzees indeed experienced a selective sweep that mainly  targeted the chromosomal segment carrying the Mhc class I region. Probably due  to genetic linkage, the sweep also affected other polymorphic loci, mapping in  the close vicinity of the Mhc class I region genes. Nevertheless, although the  allelic repertoire at particular Mhc class I and II loci appears to be limited,  naturally occurring recombination events allowed the establishment of haplotype  diversity after the sweep. However, recombination did not have sufficient time  to erase the signal of the selective sweep.', 'We investigated DNA sequence diversity for loci on chromosomes 1 and 2 in six  natural populations of Arabidopsis lyrata and tested for the role of natural  selection in structuring genomewide patterns of variability, specifically  examining the effects of recombination rate on levels of silent polymorphism. In  contrast with theoretical predictions from models of genetic hitchhiking,  maximum-likelihood-based analyses of diversity and divergence do not suggest  reduction of diversity in the region of suppressed recombination near the  centromere of chromosome 1, except in a single population from Russia, in which  the pericentromeric region may have undergone a local selective sweep or  demographic process that reduced variability. We discuss various possibilities  that might explain why nucleotide diversity in most A. lyrata populations is not  related to recombination rate, including genic recombination hotspots, and low  gene density in the low recombination rate region.', 'A central problem in population genetics is to detect and analyze positive  natural selection by which beneficial mutations are driven to fixation. The  hitchhiking effect of a rapidly spreading beneficial mutation, which results in  local removal of standing genetic variation, allows such an analysis using DNA  sequence polymorphism. However, the current mathematical theory that predicts  the pattern of genetic hitchhiking relies on the assumption that a beneficial  mutation increases to a high frequency in a single random-mating population,  which is certainly violated in reality. Individuals in natural populations are  distributed over a geographic space. The spread of a beneficial allele can be  delayed by limited migration of individuals over the space and its hitchhiking  effect can also be affected. To study this effect of geographic structure on  genetic hitchhiking, we analyze a simple model of directional selection in a  subdivided population. In contrast to previous studies on hitchhiking in  subdivided populations, we mainly investigate the range of sufficiently high  migration rates that would homogenize genetic variation at neutral loci. We  provide a heuristic mathematical analysis that describes how the genealogical  structure at a neutral locus linked to the locus under selection is expected to  change in a population divided into two demes. Our results indicate that the  overall strength of genetic hitchhiking--the degree to which expected  heterozygosity decreases--is diminished by population subdivision, mainly  because opportunity for the breakdown of hitchhiking by recombination increases  as the spread of the beneficial mutation across demes is delayed when migration  rate is much smaller than the strength of selection. Furthermore, the amount of  genetic variation after a selective sweep is expected to be unequal over demes:  a greater reduction in expected heterozygosity occurs in the subpopulation from  which the beneficial mutation originates than in its neighboring subpopulations.  This raises a possibility of detecting a ""hidden"" geographic structure of  population by carefully analyzing the pattern of a selective sweep.', 'The positive selection of a nucleotide substitution in exon 2 of Plasmodium  falciparum chloroquine resistance transporter (pfcrt) gene (mutation responsible  for chloroquine resistance) causes a reduction in variation of neutral loci  close to the gene. This reduction in allelic diversity around flanking regions  of pfcrt gene was reported in worldwide chloroquine resistant isolates and  referred as selective sweep. In Plasmodium falciparum isolates of India, the  selective sweep in flanking loci of pfcrt gene is well established, however,  high allelic diversity observed in intragenic microsatellites of pfcrt gene  implied an ongoing genetic recombination. To understand, if molecular evolution  of chloroquine-resistant P. falciparum isolates in India follow a selective  sweep model, we analyzed genetic diversity at both seven intragenic and seven  flanking microsatellites of pfcrt (-24 to +106kb) gene in chloroquine sensitive  and resistant parasites originating from high and low transmission areas. We  observed low expected heterozygosity at all loci of resistant pfcrt-haplotypes  (He=0-0.77) compared to the wild-type (He=0.38-0.96). Resistant SVMNT from high  transmission areas showed significantly higher mean He (P=0.03, t-test) at both  intragenic and pfcrt-flanking loci (-24 to +22 kb) in comparison to low  transmission areas. Our observation of reduction in variation at both intragenic  and flanking loci of mutant pfcrt gene confirmed the selective sweep model of  natural selection in chloroquine resistant P. falciparum isolates in India.', 'Wing patterning in Heliconius butterflies is a longstanding example of both  Müllerian mimicry and phenotypic radiation under strong natural selection. The  loci controlling such patterns are ""hotspots"" for adaptive evolution with great  allelic diversity across different species in the genus. We characterise  nucleotide variation, genotype-by-phenotype associations, linkage  disequilibrium, and candidate gene expression at two loci and across multiple  hybrid zones in Heliconius melpomene and relatives. Alleles at HmB control the  presence or absence of the red forewing band, while alleles at HmYb control the  yellow hindwing bar. Across HmYb two regions, separated by approximately 100 kb,  show significant genotype-by-phenotype associations that are replicated across  independent hybrid zones. In contrast, at HmB a single peak of association  indicates the likely position of functional sites at three genes, encoding a  kinesin, a G-protein coupled receptor, and an mRNA splicing factor. At both HmYb  and HmB there is evidence for enhanced linkage disequilibrium (LD) between  associated sites separated by up to 14 kb, suggesting that multiple sites are  under selection. However, there was no evidence for reduced variation or  deviations from neutrality that might indicate a recent selective sweep,  consistent with these alleles being relatively old. Of the three genes showing  an association with the HmB locus, the kinesin shows differences in wing disc  expression between races that are replicated in the co-mimic, Heliconius erato,  providing striking evidence for parallel changes in gene expression between  Müllerian co-mimics. Wing patterning loci in Heliconius melpomene therefore show  a haplotype structure maintained by selection, but no evidence for a recent  selective sweep. The complex genetic pattern contrasts with the simple genetic  basis of many adaptive traits studied previously, but may provide a better model  for most adaptation in natural populations that has arisen over millions rather  than tens of years.', 'The production performance of pigs has been significantly improved due to  long-term artificial selection, and the specific variation characterizations  (selection signatures) emerged from the selected genome regions. Different types  of breeds are subjected to different selection intensities and had different  selection signatures. Selective sweep analysis is one of major methods to detect  the selection signatures. In this study, based on the 60K BeadChip genotyping  data of both commercial Large White (n=45) and local Tongcheng pigs (n=45),  genetic differentiation coefficient Fst was applied to detect the selection  signatures. Using gPLINK software to set quality control standards, a total of  34 304 SNPs were selected for statistical analysis. Fst values between two  breeds were estimated with Genepop package and the average Fst value was 0.3209.  Setting Fst>0.7036 (1% of total number of Fst values) as selection threshold,  344 SNPs were obtained and SNP location annotation indicated that there were 79  candidate genes (Sus scrofa Build 9). Furthermore, network analysis was  performed using Ingenuity Pathway Analysis and the preliminary results suggested  that most genes were involved in growth, reproduction, and immune response, such  as NCOA6, ERBB4, RUNX2, and APOB genes. The findings from this study will  contribute to further identification of candidate genes and causal mutations  implying for meat production and disease resistance in pig.', 'We investigated DNA sequence diversity for loci on chromosomes 1 and 2 in six  natural populations of Arabidopsis lyrata and tested for the role of natural  selection in structuring genomewide patterns of variability, specifically  examining the effects of recombination rate on levels of silent polymorphism. In  contrast with theoretical predictions from models of genetic hitchhiking,  maximum-likelihood-based analyses of diversity and divergence do not suggest  reduction of diversity in the region of suppressed recombination near the  centromere of chromosome 1, except in a single population from Russia, in which  the pericentromeric region may have undergone a local selective sweep or  demographic process that reduced variability. We discuss various possibilities  that might explain why nucleotide diversity in most A. lyrata populations is not  related to recombination rate, including genic recombination hotspots, and low  gene density in the low recombination rate region.', 'The controversy over the evolutionary advantage of recombination initially  discovered by Fisher and by Muller is reviewed. Those authors whose models had  finite-population effects found an advantage of recombination, and those whose  models had infinite populations found none. The advantage of recombination is  that it breaks down random linkage disequilibrium generated by genetic drift.  Hill and Robertson found that the average effect of this randomly-generated  linkage disequilibrium was to cause linked loci to interfere with each other\'s  response to selection, even where there was no gene interaction between the  loci. This effect is shown to be identical to the original argument of Fisher  and Muller. It also predicts the ""ratchet mechanism"" discovered by Muller, who  pointed out that deleterious mutants would more readily increase in a population  without recombination. Computer simulations of substitution of favorable mutants  and of the long-term increase of deleterious mutants verified the essential  correctness of the original Fisher-Muller argument and the reality of the Muller  ratchet mechanism. It is argued that these constitute an intrinsic advantage of  recombination capable of accounting for its persistence in the face of selection  for tighter linkage between interacting polymorphisms, and possibly capable of  accounting for its origin.', ""Sex and recombination are widespread, but explaining these phenomena has been  one of the most difficult problems in evolutionary biology. Recombination is  advantageous when different individuals in a population carry different  advantageous alleles. By bringing together advantageous alleles onto the same  chromosome, recombination speeds up the process of adaptation and opposes the  fixation of harmful mutations by means of Muller's ratchet. Nevertheless,  adaptive substitutions favour sex and recombination only if the rate of adaptive  mutation is high, and Muller's ratchet operates only in small or asexual  populations. Here, by tracking the fate of modifier alleles that alter the  frequency of sex and recombination, we show that background selection against  deleterious mutant alleles provides a stochastic advantage to sex and  recombination that increases with population size. The advantage arises because,  with low levels of recombination, selection at other loci severely reduces the  effective population size and genetic variance in fitness at a focal locus (the  Hill-Robertson effect), making a population less able to respond to selection  and to rid itself of deleterious mutations. Sex and recombination reveal the  hidden genetic variance in fitness by combining chromosomes of intermediate  fitness to create chromosomes that are relatively free of (or are loaded with)  deleterious mutations. This increase in genetic variance within finite  populations improves the response to selection and generates a substantial  advantage to sex and recombination that is fairly insensitive to the form of  epistatic interactions between deleterious alleles. The mechanism supported by  our results offers a robust and broadly applicable explanation for the  evolutionary advantage of recombination and can explain the spread of costly  sex."", 'Many domestic dog breeds have originated through fixation of discrete mutations  by intense artificial selection. As a result of this process, markers in the  proximity of genes influencing breed-defining traits will have reduced variation  (a selective sweep) and will show divergence in allele frequency. Consequently,  low-resolution genomic scans can potentially be used to identify regions  containing genes that have a major influence on breed-defining traits. We model  the process of breed formation and show that the probability of two or three  adjacent marker loci showing a spurious signal of selection within at least one  breed (i.e., Type I error or false-positive rate) is low if highly variable and  moderately spaced markers are utilized. We also use simulations with selection  to demonstrate that even a moderately spaced set of highly polymorphic markers  (e.g., one every 0.8 cM) has high power to detect regions targeted by strong  artificial selection in dogs. Further, we show that a gene responsible for black  coat color in the Large Munsterlander has a 40-Mb region surrounding the gene  that is very low in heterozygosity for microsatellite markers. Similarly, we  survey 302 microsatellite markers in the Dachshund and find three linked  monomorphic microsatellite markers all within a 10-Mb region on chromosome 3.  This region contains the FGFR3 gene, which is responsible for achondroplasia in  humans, but not in dogs. Consequently, our results suggest that the causative  mutation is a gene or regulatory region closely linked to FGFR3.']","Selective sweep is a phenomenon in which the fixation of strongly beneficial alleles within a population reduces genetic diversity at partially linked neutral loci. Reduced variation or deviations from neutrality, along with an excess of fixed replacement sites, are indicative of selective sweep."
5,List markers for autophagy.,"['Equine arteritis virus (EAV) is an enveloped, positive-strand RNA virus. Genome  replication of EAV has been associated with modified intracellular membranes  that are shaped into double-membrane vesicles (DMVs). We showed by  immuno-electron microscopy that the DMVs induced in EAV-infected cells contain  double-strand (ds)RNA molecules, presumed RNA replication intermediates, and are  decorated with the autophagy marker protein microtubule-associated protein 1  light chain 3 (LC3). Replication of EAV, however, was not affected in  autophagy-deficient cells lacking autophagy-related protein 7 (ATG7).  Nevertheless, colocalization of DMVs and LC3 was still observed in these  knockout cells, which only contain the nonlipidated form of LC3. Although  autophagy is not required, depletion of LC3 markedly reduced the replication of  EAV. EAV replication could be fully restored in these cells by expression of a  nonlipidated form of LC3. These findings demonstrate an autophagy-independent  role for LC3 in EAV replication. Together with the observation that EAV-induced  DMVs are also positive for ER degradation-enhancing α-mannosidase-like 1  (EDEM1), our data suggested that this virus, similarly to the distantly-related  mouse hepatitis coronavirus, hijacks the ER-derived membranes of EDEMosomes to  ensure its efficient replication.', 'Preischemic hyperglycemia exacerbates brain damage caused by cerebral ischemia.  In the present experiment, we studied the effects of preischemic hyperglycemia  on protein markers that are related to mitochondrial fission and fusion,  mitochondrial biogenesis, and autophagy in mice subjected to 30-min transient  focal ischemia. The fission proteins dynamin-related protein 1 (Drp1) and  fission 1 (Fis1), fusion proteins optic atrophy 1 (Opa1) and mitofusin 2 (Mfn2),  mitochondrial biogenesis regulators nuclear respiratory factor 1 (NRF1) and  peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor gamma coactivator 1-alpha (PGC-1α),  and autophagy marker beclin 1 and microtubule-associated protein light chain 3  (LC3) were analyzed in control, 30 min middle cerebral artery occlusion (MCAO)  plus 6-, 24-, and 72 h of reperfusion in normo- and hyperglycemic conditions.  Cerebral ischemia increased the levels of Drp1 and decreased Fis1 after  reperfusion. Preischemic hyperglycemia further augmented the increase of Drp1  and induced elevation in Fis1. Ischemia inhibited the levels of Opa1 and Mfn2  and hyperglycemia further decreased the level of Opa1. Further, NRF1 increased  after reperfusion in both normo- and hyperglycemic animals. However, such  increase was caused by reperfusion rather than glucose level. Finally, ischemia  increased beclin 1 level at 6 and 24 h of reperfusion and hyperglycemia further  increased the beclin 1 level and caused LC3-II increase as well. Hyperglycemia  enhances the ischemia-induced mitochondrial dynamic imbalance towards fission  that may favor mitochondrial fragmentation and subsequent damage. Hyperglycemia  elevated autophagy markers may represent an adapting reaction to the severe  damage incurred in hyperglycemic animals or a third pathway of cell death.', 'Ovarian cancer is a leading cause of cancer death in women in the United States.  While the majority of ovarian cancers are serous, some rarer subtypes (i.e.  clear cell) are often associated with endometriosis, a benign gynecological  disease. Iron is rich in the cyst fluid of endometriosis-associated ovarian  cancers and induces persistent oxidative stress. The role of iron, an essential  nutrient involved in multiple cellular functions, in normal ovarian cell  survival and ovarian cancer remains unclear. Iron, presented as ferric ammonium  citrate (FAC), dramatically inhibits cell survival in ovarian cancer cell types  associated with Ras mutations, while it is without effect in immortalized normal  ovarian surface epithelial (T80) and endometriotic epithelial cells (lacking Ras  mutations). Interestingly, FAC induced changes in cytoplasmic vacuolation  concurrently with increases in LC3-II levels (an autophagy marker); these  changes occurred in an ATG5/ATG7-dependent, beclin-1/hVps34-independent, and  Ras-independent manner. Knockdown of autophagy mediators in HEY ovarian cancer  cells reversed FAC-induced LC3-II levels, but there was little effect on  reversing the cell death response. Intriguingly, transmission electron  microscopy of FAC-treated T80 cells demonstrated abundant lysosomes (confirmed  using Lysotracker) rich in iron particles, which occurred in a Ras-independent  manner. Although the mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) inhibitor, U0126,  reversed FAC-induced LC3-II/autophagic punctae and lysosomes in a  Ras-independent manner, it was remarkable that U0126 reversed cell death in  malignant ovarian cells associated with Ras mutations. Moreover, FAC increased  heme oxygenase-1 expression in H-Ras-overexpressing T80 cells, which was  associated with increased cell death when overexpressed in T80 cells. Disruption  of intracellular iron levels, via chelation of intracellular iron  (deferoxamine), was also detrimental to malignant ovarian cell survival; thus,  homeostatic intracellular iron levels are essential for cell survival.  Collectively, our results implicate iron in modulating cell death in a Ras- and  MAPK-dependent manner in ovarian cancer cells.', 'Chlamydia trachomatis is an obligate intracellular bacterium responsible for one  of the most common sexually transmitted diseases. In epithelial cells, C.  trachomatis resides in a modified membrane-bound vacuole known as an inclusion,  which is isolated from the endocytic pathway. However, the maturation process of  C. trachomatis within immune cells, such as macrophages, has not been studied  extensively. Here, we demonstrated that RAW macrophages effectively suppressed  C. trachomatis growth and prevented Golgi stack disruption, a hallmark defect in  epithelial cells after C. trachomatis infection. Next, we systematically  examined association between C. trachomatis and various endocytic pathway  markers. Spinning disk confocal time-lapse studies revealed significant and  rapid association between C. trachomatis with Rab7 and LAMP1, markers of late  endosomes and lysosomes. Moreover, pretreatment with an inhibitor of lysosome  acidification led to significant increases in C. trachomatis growth in  macrophages. At later stages of infection, C. trachomatis associated with the  autophagy marker LC3. TEM analysis confirmed that a significant portion of C.  trachomatis resided within double-membrane-bound compartments, characteristic of  autophagosomes. Together, these results suggest that macrophages can suppress C.  trachomatis growth by targeting it rapidly to lysosomes; moreover, autophagy is  activated at later stages of infection and targets significant numbers of the  invading bacteria, which may enhance subsequent chlamydial antigen presentation.', ""AIM: To investigate the effects of mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR)  inhibition on liver regeneration and autophagy in a surgical resection model. METHODS: C57BL/6 mice were subjected to a 70% partial hepatectomy (PH) and  treated intraperitoneally every 24 h with a combination of the mTOR inhibitor  rapamycin (2.5 mg/kg per day) and the steroid dexamethasone (2.0 mg/kg per day)  in phosphate buffered saline (PBS) or with PBS alone as vehicle control. In the  immunosuppressant group, part of the group was treated subcutaneously 4 h prior  to and 24 h after PH with a combination of human recombinant interleukin 6  (IL-6; 500 μg/kg per day) and hepatocyte growth factor (HGF; 100 μg/kg per day)  in PBS. Animals were sacrificed 2, 3 or 5 d after PH and liver tissue and blood  were collected for further analysis. Immunohistochemical staining for  5-Bromo-2'-deoxyuridine (BrdU) was used to quantify hepatocyte proliferation.  Western blotting was used to detect hepatic microtubule-associated protein 1  light chain 3 (LC3)-II protein expression as a marker for autophagy. Hepatic  gene expression levels of proliferation-, inflammation- and angiogenesis-related  genes were examined by real-time reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction  and serum bilirubin and transaminase levels were analyzed at the clinical  chemical core facility of the Erasmus MC-University Medical Center. RESULTS: mTOR inhibition significantly suppressed regeneration, shown by  decreased hepatocyte proliferation (2% vs 12% BrdU positive hepatocyte nuclei at  day 2, P < 0.01; 0.8% vs 1.4% at day 5, P = 0.02) and liver weight  reconstitution (63% vs 76% of initial total liver weight at day 3, P = 0.04),  and furthermore increased serum transaminase levels (aspartate aminotransferase  641 U/L vs 185 U/L at day 2, P = 0.02). Expression of the autophagy marker  LC3-II, which was reduced during normal liver regeneration, increased after mTOR  inhibition (46% increase at day 2, P = 0.04). Hepatic gene expression showed an  increased inflammation-related response [tumor necrosis factor (TNF)-α 3.2-fold  upregulation at day 2, P = 0.03; IL-1Ra 6.0-fold upregulation at day 2 and  42.3-fold upregulation at day 5, P < 0.01] and a reduced expression of cell  cycle progression and angiogenesis-related factors (HGF 40% reduction at day 2;  vascular endothelial growth factor receptor 2 50% reduction at days 2 and 5;  angiopoietin 1 60% reduction at day 2, all P ≤ 0.01). Treatment with the  regeneration stimulating cytokine IL-6 and growth factor HGF could overcome the  inhibitory effect on liver weight (75% of initial total liver weight at day 3, P  = 0.02 vs immunosuppression alone and P = 0.90 vs controls) and partially  reversed gene expression changes caused by rapamycin (TNF-α and IL-1Ra levels at  day 2 were restored to control levels). However, no significant changes in  hepatocyte proliferation, serum injury markers or autophagy were found. CONCLUSION: mTOR inhibition severely impairs liver regeneration and increases  autophagy after PH. These effects are partly reversed by stimulation of the IL-6  and HGF pathways."", 'Autophagy is an important catabolic process with roles in cell survival and cell  death. It sequesters cytosol and organelles within double-membrane  autophagosomes that deliver their contents to lysosomes for degradation.  Autophagosome biogenesis is coordinated by the autophagy-related protein 4  (Atg4) family of C54 endopeptidases (Atg4A-Atg4D). These enzymes prime and then  later delipidate the autophagosome marker, Atg8. Here, we show that one family  member, Atg4D, is cleaved by caspase-3 in vitro and in apoptotic cells. Atg4D is  a poor priming and delipidation enzyme in vitro, but truncated DeltaN63 Atg4D  displays increased activity against the Atg8 paralogue, gamma-aminobutyric acid  receptor-associated protein-like 1 (GABARAP-L1). In living cells, DeltaN63 Atg4D  stimulates the delipidation of GABARAP-L1, whereas siRNA silencing of the gene  expressing Atg4D abrogates GABARAP-L1 autophagosome formation and sensitises  cells to starvation and staurosporine-induced cell death. Interestingly, Atg4D  overexpression induces apoptosis, which is preceded by the caspase-independent  recruitment of Atg4D to mitochondria and is facilitated by a putative C-terminal  Bcl-2 homology 3 (BH3) domain. Atg4D also acquires affinity for damaged  mitochondria in cells treated with hydrogen peroxide. These data suggest that  Atg4D is an autophagy regulator that links mitochondrial dysfunction with  apoptosis.', 'Oncogene-induced senescence (OIS) is a highly dynamic process, involving several  different effector mechanisms, the multitude and combination of which likely  determines the quality of the phenotype (Pérez-Mancera et al., Nat Rev Cancer  14:547-558, 2014). Autophagy, a cellular degradation process, has been proposed  to be one of these senescence effectors, although its functional relevance seems  highly context dependent (Hoare et al., Semin Cancer Biol 21:397-404, 2011). A  number of methods for monitoring autophagy are available, and several excellent  protocols have been published in this journal (Klionsky et al., Autophagy  8:445-544, 2012; Tooze et al., Methods Mol Biol 1270:155-165, 2015; Tabata et  al., Methods Mol Biol 931:449-466, 2013; Young and Tooze, Methods Mol Biol  445:147-157, 2008). The same principles apply to models of OIS in culture. Thus,  in this chapter, we describe how to generate OIS cells using human diploid  fibroblasts (HDFs), the best-characterized cell model of OIS, and how to detect  autophagy, particularly focusing on immunofluorescence methods.', 'Mitochondria autophagy (mitophagy) is the process of selective degradation of  mitochondria that has an important role in mitochondrial quality control. To  gain insight into the molecular mechanism of mitophagy, we screened a yeast  knockout library for strains that are defective in mitophagy. We found 32  strains that showed a complete or partial block of mitophagy. One of the genes  identified, YLR356W, is required for mitophagy, but not for macroautophagy or  other types of selective autophagy. The deletion of YLR356W partially inhibits  mitophagy during starvation, whereas there is almost complete inhibition at  post-log phase. Accordingly, we hypothesize that Ylr356w is required to detect  or present aged or dysfunctional mitochondria when cells reach the post-log  phase.', 'Macroautophagy (hereafter referred to as autophagy) is an evolutionarily  conserved catabolic process necessary for normal recycling of cellular  constituents and for appropriate response to cellular stress. Although several  genes belonging to the core molecular machinery involved in autophagosome  formation have been discovered, relatively little is known about the nature of  signaling networks controlling autophagy upon intracellular or extracellular  stimuli. We discovered ATG8-like proteins (MAP1LC3B, GABARAP and GABARAPL1) as  novel interactors of MAPK15/ERK8, a MAP kinase involved in cell proliferation  and transformation. Based on the role of these proteins in the autophagic  process, we demonstrated that MAPK15 is indeed localized to autophagic  compartments and increased, in a kinase-dependent fashion, ATG8-like proteins  lipidation, autophagosome formation and SQSTM1 degradation, while decreasing  LC3B inhibitory phosphorylation. Interestingly, we also identified a conserved  LC3-interacting region (LIR) in MAPK15 responsible for its interaction with  ATG8-like proteins, for its localization to autophagic structures and,  consequently, for stimulation of the formation of these compartments.  Furthermore, we reveal that MAPK15 activity was induced in response to serum and  amino-acid starvation and that this stimulus, in turn, required endogenous  MAPK15 expression to induce the autophagic process. Altogether, these results  suggested a new function for MAPK15 as a regulator of autophagy, acting through  interaction with ATG8 family proteins. Also, based on the key role of this  process in several human diseases, these results supported the use of this MAP  kinase as a potential novel therapeutic target.', 'There is growing evidence that macroautophagic cargo is not limited to bulk  cytosol in response to starvation and can occur selectively for substrates,  including aggregated proteins. It remains unclear, however, whether  starvation-induced and selective macroautophagy share identical adaptor  molecules to capture their cargo. Here, we report that Alfy, a  phosphatidylinositol 3-phosphate-binding protein, is central to the selective  elimination of aggregated proteins. We report that the loss of Alfy inhibits the  clearance of inclusions, with little to no effect on the starvation response.  Alfy is recruited to intracellular inclusions and scaffolds a complex between  p62(SQSTM1)-positive proteins and the autophagic effectors Atg5, Atg12, Atg16L,  and LC3. Alfy overexpression leads to elimination of aggregates in an  Atg5-dependent manner and, likewise, to protection in a neuronal and Drosophila  model of polyglutamine toxicity. We propose that Alfy plays a key role in  selective macroautophagy by bridging cargo to the molecular machinery that  builds autophagosomes.']",Expression of LC3-II and BECN1 as well as SQSTM1 are used as markers of autophagy activity.
6,Can a circRNA be translated into protein?,"['Circular RNAs (circRNAs) are highly abundant and evolutionarily conserved  non-coding RNAs produced by circularization of specific exons. Since their  re-discovery as potential regulators of gene expression, thousands of circRNAs  were detected in different tissues and cell types across most organisms.  Accumulating data suggest key roles for them in the central nervous system.  Neuronal-expressed RNAs are diverted to yield highly enriched CircRNAs in human,  mouse, pig and flies, with many of them enriched in neuronal tissues. CircRNA  levels are dynamically modulated in neurons, both during differentiation and  following bursts of electrical activity, and accumulate with age, and many of  them are enriched in synapses. Together, available data suggest that circRNAs  have important roles in synaptic plasticity and neuronal function. This review  covers current advances in the field and lays out hypotheses regarding functions  of circRNAs in the brain as well as their putative involvement in initiation and  progression of neurodegenerative processes.', ""SUMMARY: Circular RNAs (circRNAs), a novel class of endogenous RNAs, are  widespread in eukaryotic cells. Emerging roles in diverse biological processes  suggest that circRNA is a promising key player in RNA world. Most circRNAs are  generated through back-splicing of pre-mRNAs, forming a covalently closed loop  structure with no 5' caps or 3' polyadenylated tails. In addition, most circRNAs  were not associated with translating ribosomes, therefore, circRNAs were deemed  to be noncoding. However, the latest research findings revealed that some  circRNAs could generate proteins in vivo, which expands the landscape of  transcriptome and proteome. To gain insights into the new area of circRNA  translation, we introduce an integrated tool capable of detecting circRNAs with  protein-coding potential from high-throughput sequencing data. AVAILABILITY AND IMPLEMENTATION: CircPro is available at  http://bis.zju.edu.cn/CircPro. CONTACT: mchen@zju.edu.cn. SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: Supplementary data are available at Bioinformatics  online."", 'Insights into the circular RNA (circRNA) exploration have revealed that they are  abundant in eukaryotic transcriptomes. Diverse genomic regions can generate  different types of RNA circles, implying their diversity. Covalently closed loop  structures elevate the stability of this new type of noncoding RNA.  High-throughput sequencing analyses suggest that circRNAs exhibit tissue- and  developmental-specific expression, indicating that they may play crucial roles  in multiple cellular processes. Strikingly, several circRNAs could function as  microRNA sponges and regulate gene transcription, highlighting a new class of  important regulators. Here, we review the recent advances in knowledge of  endogenous circRNA biogenesis, properties and functions. We further discuss the  current findings about circRNAs in human diseases. In plants, the roles of  circRNAs remain a mystery. Online resources and bioinformatics identification of  circRNAs are essential for the analysis of circRNA biology, although different  strategies yield divergent results. The understanding of circRNA functions  remains limited; however, circRNAs are enriching the RNA world, acting as an  emerging key player.', 'Circular RNAs (circRNAs) are long, non-coding RNAs that result from the  non-canonical splicing of linear pre-mRNAs. However, the characteristics and the  critical role of circRNA in co-/post-transcriptional regulation were not well  recognized until the ""microRNA sponge"" function of circRNA is discovered. Recent  studies have mainly been devoted to the function of the circular RNA sponge for  miR-7 (ciRS-7) and sex-determining region Y (SRY) by targeting microRNA-7  (miR-7) and microRNA-138 (miR-138), respectively. In this review, we illustrate  the specific role of circRNAs in a wide variety of cancers and in regulating the  biological behavior of cancers via miR-7 or miR-138 regulation. Furthermore,  circRNA, together with its gene silencing ability, also shows its potential in  RNA interference (RNAi) therapy by binding to target RNAs, which provides a  novel perspective in cancer treatment. Thus, this review concerns the  biogenesis, biological function, oncogenesis, progression and possible therapies  for cancer involving circRNAs.', 'Circular RNAs (circRNAs) are abundant and evolutionarily conserved RNAs of  largely unknown function. Here, we show that a subset of circRNAs is translated  in\xa0vivo. By performing ribosome footprinting from fly heads, we demonstrate that  a group of circRNAs is associated with translating ribosomes. Many of these  ribo-circRNAs use the start codon of the hosting mRNA, are bound by  membrane-associated ribosomes, and have evolutionarily conserved termination  codons. In addition, we found that a circRNA generated from the muscleblind  locus encodes a protein, which we detected in fly head extracts by mass  spectrometry. Next, by performing in\xa0vivo and in\xa0vitro translation assays, we  show that UTRs of ribo-circRNAs (cUTRs) allow cap-independent translation.  Moreover, we found that starvation and FOXO likely regulate the translation of a  circMbl isoform. Altogether, our study provides strong evidence for translation  of circRNAs, revealing the existence of an unexplored layer of gene activity.', 'Circular RNAs (circRNAs) represent a large class of noncoding RNAs (ncRNAs) that  have recently emerged as regulators of gene expression. They have been shown to  suppress microRNAs, thereby increasing the translation and stability of the  targets of such microRNAs. In this review, we discuss the emerging functions of  circRNAs, including RNA transcription, splicing, turnover, and translation. We  also discuss other possible facets of circRNAs that can influence their function  depending on the cell context, such as circRNA abundance, subcellular  localization, interacting partners (RNA, DNA, and proteins), dynamic changes in  interactions following stimulation, and potential circRNA translation. The  ensuing changes in gene expression patterns elicited by circRNAs are proposed to  drive key cellular processes, such as cell proliferation, differentiation, and  survival, that govern health and disease.

At present, research on circRNAs is an  active area because of their diverse roles in development, health, and diseases.  Partly because their circularity makes them resistant to degradation, they hold  great promise as unique biomarkers for ocular and central nervous system (CNS)  disorders. We believe that further work on their applications could help in  developing them as ""first-in-class"" diagnostics, therapeutics, and prognostic  targets for numerous eye conditions. Interestingly, many circRNAs play key roles  in transcriptional regulation by acting as miRNAs sponges, meaning that they  serve as master regulators of RNA and protein expression. Since the retina is an  extension of the brain and is part of the CNS, we highlight the current state of  circRNA biogenesis, properties, and function and we review the crucial roles  that they play in the eye and the brain. We also discuss their regulatory roles  as miRNA sponges, regulation of their parental genes or linear mRNAs,  translation into micropeptides or proteins, and responses to cellular stress. We  posit that future advances will provide newer insights into the fields of RNA  metabolism in general and diseases of the aging eye and brain in particular.

7,"There is no drug available to prevent HIV infection, Pre-exposure prophylaxis (PrEP), yes or no?","[""HIV pre-exposure prophylaxis (PrEP) is the use of one or more antiretroviral  medications (in combination) to prevent HIV infection. The most commonly used  PrEP medication (Truvada® , Gilead Sciences, Inc.) acts by inhibiting HIV-1  reverse transcriptase. If someone who is using PrEP unknowingly becomes HIV  infected (termed 'PrEP breakthrough infection'), there may be suppressed viral  replication resulting in a virus level undetectable by the most sensitive HIV  NAT. Failure to seroconvert and seroreversion (loss of previously detectable HIV  antibodies) have also both been observed with 2nd, 3rd and 4th generation  screening immunoassays, as well as Western blot assays. If such a person was  tested in the course of donating blood, the results may therefore be difficult  to interpret. The index of suspicion for possible PrEP 'interference' should be  highest in the context of concomitant low-level positive or 'greyzone'  reactivity on HIV NAT and serological tests, which is an unusual pattern in  acutely HIV-infected blood donors. Another possibility is detectable HIV RNA  with negative HIV serology (i.e. a potential 'NAT yield' case) but without  subsequent HIV seroconversion (or disappearance of HIV RNA). Excluding  antiretroviral therapy or PrEP use by the donor in such circumstances would be  important. The current rarity of PrEP breakthrough infection indicates that any  potential safety risk is likely very small. However, considering the increasing  use of PrEP we feel it is prudent for those interpreting HIV donor screening  test results to consider the potential for PrEP interference."", 'BACKGROUND: The potential impact of antiretroviral therapy (ART) and  pre-exposure prophylaxis (PrEP) with overlapping and nonoverlapping  antiretrovirals (ARVs) on human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) transmission and  drug resistance is unknown. METHODS: A detailed mathematical model was used to simulate the epidemiological  impact of ART alone, PrEP alone, and combined ART + PrEP in South Africa. RESULTS: ART alone initiated at a CD4 lymphocyte cell count <200 cells/µL (80%  coverage and 96% effectiveness) prevents 20% of HIV infections over 10 years but  increases drug resistance prevalence to 6.6%. PrEP alone (30% coverage and 75%  effectiveness) also prevents 21% of infections but with lower resistance  prevalence of 0.5%. The ratio of cumulative infections prevented to prevalent  drug-resistant cases after 10 years is 7-fold higher for PrEP than for ART.  Combined ART + PrEP with overlapping ARVs prevents 35% of infections but  increases resistance prevalence to 8.2%, whereas ART + PrEP with nonoverlapping  ARVs prevents slightly more infections (37%) and reduces resistance prevalence  to 7.2%. CONCLUSIONS: Combined ART + PrEP is likely to prevent more HIV infections than  either strategy alone, but with higher prevalence of drug resistance. ART is  predicted to contribute more to resistance than is PrEP. Optimizing both ART and  PrEP effectiveness and delivery are the keys to preventing HIV transmission and  drug resistance.', ""Author information: (1)Department of Genitourinary Medicine and Infectious Disease, Guys and St  Thomas' NHS Trust, London, UK. julie.fox@kcl.ac.uk.

HIV  pre-exposure prophylaxis (PrEP) is a new approach that involves the ongoing use  of antiretroviral medications by HIV-negative individuals to reduce the risk of  HIV infection. The use of daily tenofovir/emtricitabine as oral PrEP was found  to be effective in multiple placebo-controlled clinical trials and approved by  the United States Food and Drug Administration. In addition, the Centers for  Disease Control and Prevention in the United States and the World Health  Organization have both released guidelines recommending the offer of oral PrEP  to high-risk populations. The scale-up of PrEP is underway, but several  implementation questions remain unanswered. Demonstration projects and  open-label extensions of placebo-controlled trials are ongoing and hope to  contribute to our understanding of PrEP use and delivery outside the randomized  controlled trial setting. Evidence is beginning to emerge from these open-label  studies and will be critical for guiding PrEP scale-up. Outside of such studies,  PrEP uptake has been slow and several client- and provider-related barriers are  limiting uptake. Maximizing the public health impact of PrEP will require  rollout to be combined with interventions to promote uptake, support adherence,  and prevent increases in risk behavior. Additional PrEP strategies are currently  under investigation in placebo-controlled clinical trials and may be available  in the future.', 'INTRODUCTION: Use of pre-exposure prophylaxis (PrEP) among people who inject  drugs (PWID) has been shown to be effective in preventing HIV transmission. We  examined correlates of the willingness to use PrEP among community-recruited  older PWID in Washington, DC. METHODS: PWID were recruited using respondent-driven sampling (RDS) and  completed a behavioral interview for the National HIV Behavioral Surveillance  system in 2012. Participants reported on willingness to use PrEP and how it  might affect their drug use and sexual behaviors. We reported RDS-weighted  proportions and multivariable correlates of being willing to use PrEP. RESULTS: Among 304 participants, 69% were male, and the majority was aged ≥50  and black. Only 13.4% had ever heard of using anti-HIV medication to prevent  HIV; none had ever used PrEP or knew anyone who used it in the past year.  Forty-seven percent were very likely and 24% were somewhat likely to take PrEP  if it were available without cost; 13% agreed they would not need to  sterilize/clean needles or use condoms if taking PrEP. Correlates of being very  likely to use PrEP included being younger (<50years), sharing cookers, cotton or  water in the past year, and believing they would no longer need to use clean  needles. CONCLUSION: Nearly half of PWID reported being very willing to use PrEP if it  were available without cost. Younger PWID and those at higher risk of sharing  cookers, cotton or water were more willing to use PrEP, suggesting a focus on  these groups to explore PrEP use among PWID.', 'Daily preexposure prophylaxis (PrEP) with Truvada (emtricitabine [FTC] and  tenofovir disoproxil fumarate [TDF]) is a novel HIV prevention strategy recently  found to reduce HIV incidence among men who have sex with men. We used a macaque  model of HIV transmission to investigate if Truvada maintains prophylactic  efficacy against an FTC-resistant isolate containing the M184V mutation. Five  macaques received a dose of Truvada 3 days before exposing them rectally to the  simian/human immunodeficiency virus mutant SHIV162p3(M184V), followed by a  second dose 2 h after exposure. Five untreated animals were used as controls.  Virus exposures were done weekly for up to 14 weeks. Despite the high  (>100-fold) level of FTC resistance conferred by M184V, all five treated animals  were protected from infection, while the five untreated macaques were infected  (P = 0.0008). Our results show that Truvada maintains high prophylactic efficacy  against an FTC-resistant isolate. Increased susceptibility to tenofovir due to  M184V and other factors, including residual antiviral activity by FTC and/or  reduced virus fitness due to M184V, may all have contributed to the observed  protection.', 'Introduction: Oral pre-exposure prophylaxis (PrEP) and antiretroviral therapy  (ART) represent the cornerstones of HIV infection prevention and treatment.  However, despite their high efficacy, the need to take daily oral pill(s)  negatively impacts long-term patient adherence. In some cases, it can also be  associated with drug-drug interactions and adverse gastrointestinal effects, as  well as being a constant reminder to individuals of their HIV status. The  availability of long-acting non-orally administered antiretroviral drugs could,  therefore, be extremely useful. Cabotegravir (CAB) is a second-generation  integrase strand transfer inhibitor, characterized by a relatively high genetic  barrier and good antiretroviral potency, which is administrable as a long-acting  injectable suspension (LAI CAB).Areas covered: The authors present and discuss  the efficacy and available safety data of LAI CAB, either when co-administered  with rilpivirine (RPV; LAI CAB + RPV) for the treatment of HIV infection, or  when used as single agent for PrEP.Expert opinion: Cabotegravir has the  potential to play a primary role in the treatment and prevention of HIV  infection. The future availability of LAI CAB + RPV and LAI CAB may mark the  beginning of an era of LAI ART and PrEP, respectively.', 'BACKGROUND: Although effective, some oral pre-exposure prophylaxis (PrEP) users  face barriers to adherence using daily pills, which could be reduced by  long-acting formulations. Long-acting cabotegravir (CAB LA) is a potential new  injectable formulation for human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) PrEP being tested  in phase III trials. METHODS: We use a mathematical model of the HIV epidemic in South Africa to  simulate CAB LA uptake by population groups with different levels of HIV risk.  We compare the trajectory of the HIV epidemic until 2050 with and without CAB LA  to estimate the impact of the intervention. RESULTS: Delivering CAB LA to 10% of the adult population could avert more than  15% of new infections from 2023 to 2050. The impact would be lower but more  efficient if delivered to populations at higher HIV risk: 127 person-years of  CAB LA use would be required to avert one HIV infection within 5 years if used  by all adults and 47 person-years if used only by the highest risk women. CONCLUSIONS: If efficacious, a CAB LA intervention could have a substantial  impact on the course of the HIV epidemic in South Africa. Uptake by those at the  highest risk of infection, particularly young women, could improve the  efficiency of any intervention.', 'Attempts to prevent HIV infection through pre-exposure prophylaxis (PrEP)  include topical application of anti-HIV drugs to the mucosal sites of infection;  however, a potential role for local drug metabolizing enzymes in modulating the  exposure of the mucosal tissues to these drugs has yet to be explored. Here we  present the first report that enzymes belonging to the cytochrome P450 (CYP) and  UDP-glucuronosyltransferase (UGT) families of drug metabolizing enzymes are  expressed and active in vaginal and colorectal tissue using biopsies collected  from healthy volunteers. In doing so, we discovered that dapivirine and  maraviroc, a non-nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitor and an entry  inhibitor currently in development as microbicides for HIV PrEP, are  differentially metabolized in colorectal tissue and vaginal tissue. Taken  together, these data should help to guide the optimization of small molecules  being developed for HIV PrEP.', 'The retrovirus HIV-1 is the etiological agent of the decades-long AIDS pandemic.  Although vaccination is the most common preexposure route to prevent acquisition  of viral disease, scalable efficacious vaccination strategies have yet to be  developed for HIV-1. By contrast, small molecule inhibitors of the HIV-1 enzymes  reverse transcriptase, integrase, and protease have been developed that  effectively block virus replication. Three different drug compounds are commonly  prescribed for people living with HIV as once-daily oral tablets. Once-daily  pills composed of two different reverse transcriptase inhibitors are moreover  approved as preexposure prophylaxis (PrEP) treatment for virus naïve individuals  who may partake in behaviors associated with increased risk of HIV-1 acquisition  such as unprotected sex or injection drug use. Long-acting (LA) injectable HIV-1  enzyme inhibitors are at the same time being developed to sidestep adherence  noncompliance issues that can arise from self-administered once-daily oral  dosing regimens. Cabotegravir (CAB)-LA, which inhibits integrase strand transfer  activity, has in recent clinical trials been shown to prevent HIV-1 acquisition  more effectively than once-daily oral dosed reverse transcriptase inhibitors. In  this Perspective, we examine bench to bedside aspects of CAB-LA treatment and  development, starting from the biochemical basis of HIV-1 integration and  pharmacological inhibition of integrase catalysis. We also review the results of  recent clinical trials that evaluated CAB-LA, as well as the promises and  challenges that surround its use for HIV/AIDS PrEP.']",Pre-exposure prophylaxis (PrEP) with the drug combination Truvada can substantially decrease HIV transmission in individuals at risk.
8,What is Hemophilic Pseudotumor?,"['Hemophilic pseudotumor is a rare complication of hemophilia. We describe a  14-year-old young male with hemophilic pseudotumor in the second and fifth  fingers of the left hand. We treated him only with radiotherapy. A total dose of  2000 cGy in 10 fractions was administered in 2 weeks. Factor VIII was not given.  After 4 months, complete healing was seen. The patient was followed up at 24  months, and there was no evidence of recurrence and no bone growth disturbance.  Based on our experience and a review of the literature, radiotherapy can be an  effective alternative modality in treating hemophilic pseudotumor.', 'BACKGROUND: Hemophilic pseudotumor is an unusual complication occurring in only  1% to 2% of patients with severe factor VIII or IX deficiency, and manifests as  a progressive enlargement of hematoma by recurrent hemorrhage, often resulting  in bone destruction or resorption due to the chronic pressure of osseous  hemorrhage. Cranial hemophilic pseudotumors are extremely rare, with only 4  previous cases associated with mild or moderate factor XIII deficiency. CASE DESCRIPTION: A 24-year-old man with moderate deficiency of factor IX  developed a cranial pseudotumor as a swelling in the frontal scalp. Blood  coagulation profile revealed extended activated partial thromboplastin time  (58.2 seconds). Factor IX analysis showed 3% of normal activity. Computed  tomography and magnetic resonance imaging demonstrated an extra-axial lesion  with bone destruction, enhanced rim, and signal changes consistent with chronic  hemorrhage. Surgical removal was performed. Histologic examination disclosed old  blood coagulum. CONCLUSIONS: This case of cranial hemophilic pseudotumor in a patient with  moderate factor IX deficiency suggests that cranial pseudotumor should be  considered in the differential diagnosis of cranial lesion in a patient with  hemophilia, and adequate replacement therapy in the perioperative period is  essential to achieve safe surgical removal.', 'Hemophilic pseudotumor is a rare, but well-known, complication of hemophilia  occurring in 1-2\xa0% of individuals with a severe factor VIII or IX deficiency.

Very seldom, patient  with mild form of hemophilia present with intraosseous pseudotumor. This report  describe an 11-year-old boy with mild factor IX deficiency (17\xa0% of normal  factor IX activity), who developed a pseudotumor of the femur.', 'Bleeding diatheses are a hallmark of hemophilia. Hemophilic pseudotumor results  from multiple episodes of hemorrhage into bones or soft tissue spaces. It is  uncommon and is seen in severe cases of hemophilia only 1-2% of the time.  Complications and symptoms arise due to pain and/or compression of surrounding  structures. Pathologic fractures can be associated with intraosseous lesions and  can result from bone destruction or resorption due to the chronic pressure of an  osseous hemorrhage. Radiographs may demonstrate expansile lesions of the bones  or increased soft tissue density that may be associated with extra osseous  lesions. Bleeding may also occur within the joint space. These intra-articular  hemorrhages can, over time, result in hemophilic arthropathy. The following case  report demonstrates both an expansile lesion of a metacarpal as well as  hemophilic knee arthropathy in an 11 year old.', 'INTRODUCTION: Hemophilic pseudotumor is a rare complication that occurs in  patients with severe hemophilia.

Its  principal sites of occurrence are the long bones and the pelvis. Only one case  of this tumor occurring in the cranium has been previously reported. CLINICAL PRESENTATION: We report a case of cranial hemophilic pseudotumor  involving the diploe of the right parietal vault. A 29-year-old man with severe  hemophilia (Factor VIII, 0.8% of normal activity) presented with an unsightly  scalp protrusion measuring 5 x 5 x 2 cm and tingling discomfort in the left arm.  About 5 years before admission, he noted a walnut-sized, nontender mass in the  right parietal area that had enlarged slightly after minor head trauma. Tingling  discomfort developed as the manifestation of the compression of the parietal  lobe in the 2 to 3 months after the head trauma. INTERVENTION: Under proper factor replacement therapy, surgery was undertaken  for excision and tissue diagnosis. Histological examination of the content in  the diploe revealed old blood coagulum. CONCLUSION: Postoperatively, the tingling discomfort in the arm resolved  completely. To our knowledge, this is the second case of the cranial hemophilic  pseudotumor in the English literature. Diagnosis and management of cranial  hemophilic pseudotumor are presented with a review of the literature.', 'Hemophilic pseudotumors are rare, but well known complications of severe  hemophilia A, which most frequently develops at the femur, tibia, pelvic bones,  iliac bones, or rarely in the cranium or gnathic bones. This report describes a  case of hemophilic pseudotumor of the maxillary alveolar ridge that occurred in  a boy with mild hemophilia A (14% factor VIII activity). The lesion, which  presented as an alveolar mucosal swelling, responded well to enucleation,  curettage, and intralesional fibrin glue injection.', 'Hemophilic pseudotumor is an uncommon complication seen in approximately 1-2% of  patients with severe hemophilia. Hemophilic pseudotumors are distinguished into  two subdivisions based on location, proximal or distal. Plain x-rays and CT are  useful in diagnosis, but MR imaging is the diagnostic test of choice because of  its sensitivity to the various blood products. The choice of therapy depends on  many parameters, such as the size of the tumor, the age of the patient, and the  relation with underlying organs. In most cases of asymptomatic hemophilic  pseudotumor, conservative treatment with administration of missing factor as  well as immobilization is recommended. The authors describe a 13-year-old boy  with severe hemophilia A, who presented with a tibial pseudotumor a few months  after an injury. He was conservatively treated for a long period, with daily  administration of recombinant factor VIII. His clinical condition improved  shortly after therapy induction, but radiological improvement has been moderate.  Case history, imaging findings, and therapeutic options are discussed.', ""OBJECTIVES/HYPOTHESIS: Hemophilic pseudotumors are rare clinical entities in  otolaryngology. An unusual case of a pediatric hemophilic pseudotumor of the  paranasal sinus in a previously undiagnosed hemophiliac is presented. STUDY DESIGN: Case report. METHODS: A 6-month-old, otherwise healthy boy was admitted for evaluation of a  rapidly expanding left-sided cheek mass. The patient's initial presentation,  imaging workup, and intraoperative and postoperative courses are discussed. RESULTS: Imaging workup revealed a large, heterogeneous, dense lesion in the  patient's left-side maxillary sinus with distortion of the orbital floor and  hard palate. Because of the concern for an aggressive malignancy, a biopsy was  performed. After a Caldwell-Luc approach, a large amount of greenish fluid  leaked from an otherwise empty maxillary sinus. The patient continued to bleed  from his intraoral incision postoperatively and required two packed erythrocyte  transfusions. Subsequent hematological testing led to a diagnosis of severe  hemophilia type A with factor VIII levels less than 1% of normal. After  treatment with recombinant coagulation factors hemostasis was achieved, and the  patient clinically improved. CONCLUSION: The study presents the first report of a pediatric hemophilic  pseudotumor in the paranasal sinuses leading to a diagnosis of hemophilia. It is  a rare entity characterized by a cycle of repeated hemorrhage with subsequent  encapsulation of the coagulum leading to pressure-induced distortion of adjacent  bone. In the correct clinical setting, hemophilic pseudotumor should be  considered in the differential diagnosis of a rapidly expanding mass in  children.""]","Hemophilic Pseudotumor is a rare complication of hemophilia. It  is an encapsulated haematoma in patients with haemophilia  which has a tendency to progress and produce clinical symptoms related to its anatomical location. The lesion most frequently occurs in the long bones, pelvis, small bones of the hands and feet, or rarely in the maxillofacial region."
9,What are the targets of avapritinib?,"['INTRODUCTION: 90% of gastrointestinal stromal tumors (GISTs) harbor an  activating mutation in the KIT or PDGFRα oncogene, and these are known to confer  imatinib sensitivity. AREAS COVERED: The author reviews the data regarding the current management of  GIST, mechanisms of resistance to imatinib, and new drugs currently in clinical  development and provides his unique perspectives on the subject matter. EXPERT OPINION: Several studies have shown that the response to imatinib in GIST  patients mainly depends on the mutational status of KIT or PDGFRα. Moreover,  most, if not all, patients treated with imatinib for advanced GIST will develop  a secondary progressive disease under the treatment. In most cases, such  progressions are the result of acquired resistance due to the occurrence of  secondary c-KIT mutations, especially in GISTs with primary exon 11 mutations.  Sunitinib and regorafenib are inhibitors of multiple tyrosine kinases, including  KIT, PDGFRα, PDGFRβ, and VEGFRs, and are approved for the management of  imatinib- and imatinib/sunitinib-refractory GIST patients, respectively.  Clearly, better knowledge of the molecular mechanisms underlying the resistance  to imatinib as well as the development of a new class of broad-spectrum tyrosine  kinase inhibitors such as avapritinib and ripretinib will provide new  individualized therapeutic strategies for GIST patients.', 'In a phase I trial of avapritinib (formerly BLU-285), which targets D816V mutant  KIT, for the treatment of advanced systemic mastocytosis, patients experienced  rapid and durable disease control. The overall response rate was 72%, and 56% of  patients experienced a complete or partial response.

NAVIGATOR is a  two-part, single-arm, dose escalation and expansion study designed to evaluate  safety and antineoplastic activity of avapritinib, a selective, potent inhibitor  of KIT and PDGFRA, in patients with unresectable or metastatic GIST. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Eligible patients were 18\u2009years or older with  histologically or cytologically confirmed unresectable GIST and Eastern  Cooperative Oncology Group performance status ≤2 and initiated avapritinib at  300 mg or 400 mg once daily. Primary endpoints were safety in patients who  initiated avapritinib at 300 mg or 400 mg once daily and overall response rate  (ORR) in patients in the safety population with three or more previous lines of  TKI therapy. RESULTS: As of November 16, 2018, in the safety population (n =\u2009204), the most  common adverse events (AEs) were nausea (131 [64%]), fatigue (113 [55%]), anemia  (102 [50%]), cognitive effects (84 [41%]), and periorbital edema (83 [41%]); 17  (8%) patients discontinued due to treatment-related AEs, most frequently  confusion, encephalopathy, and fatigue. ORR in response-evaluable patients with  GIST harboring KIT or non-D842V PDGFRA mutations and with at least three prior  therapies (n =\u2009103) was 17% (95% confidence interval [CI], 10-25). Median  duration of response was 10.2 months (95% CI, 7.2-10.2), and median  progression-free survival was 3.7 months (95% CI, 2.8-4.6). CONCLUSION: Avapritinib has manageable toxicity with meaningful clinical  activity as fourth-line or later treatment in some patients with GIST with KIT  or PDGFRA mutations. IMPLICATIONS FOR PRACTICE: In the NAVIGATOR trial, avapritinib, an inhibitor of  KIT and platelet-derived growth factor receptor A tyrosine kinases, provided  durable responses in a proportion of patients with advanced gastrointestinal  stromal tumors (GIST) who had received three or more prior therapies.  Avapritinib had a tolerable safety profile, with cognitive adverse events  manageable with dose interruptions and modification in most cases. These  findings indicate that avapritinib can elicit durable treatment responses in  some patients with heavily pretreated GIST, for whom limited treatment options  exist.', ""BACKGROUND: Targeting of KIT and PDGFRA with imatinib revolutionised treatment  in gastrointestinal stromal tumour; however, PDGFRA Asp842Val (D842V)-mutated  gastrointestinal stromal tumour is highly resistant to tyrosine kinase  inhibitors.

METHODS: NAVIGATOR is a two-part, open-label, dose-escalation and  dose-expansion, phase 1 study done at 17 sites across nine countries (Belgium,  France, Germany, Poland, Netherlands, South Korea, Spain, the UK, and the USA).  Patients aged 18 years or older, with an Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group  performance status of 2 or less, and with adequate end-organ function were  eligible to participate. The dose-escalation part of the study included patients  with unresectable gastrointestinal stromal tumours. The dose-expansion part of  the study included patients with an unresectable PDGFRA D842V-mutant  gastrointestinal stromal tumour regardless of previous therapy or  gastrointestinal stromal tumour with other mutations that either progressed on  imatinib and one or more tyrosine kinase inhibitor, or only received imatinib  previously. On the basis of enrolment trends, ongoing review of study data, and  evolving knowledge regarding the gastrointestinal stromal tumour treatment  paradigm, it was decided by the sponsor's medical director together with the  investigators that patients with PDGFRA D842V mutations would be analysed  separately; the results from this group of patients is reported in this Article.  Oral avapritinib was administered once daily in the dose-escalation part  (starting dose of 30 mg, with increasing dose levels once daily in continuous  28-day cycles until the maximum tolerated dose or recommended phase 2 dose was  determined; in the dose-expansion part, the starting dose was the maximum  tolerated dose from the dose-escalation part). Primary endpoints were maximum  tolerated dose, recommended phase 2 dose, and safety in the dose-escalation  part, and overall response and safety in the dose-expansion part. Safety was  assessed in all patients from the dose-escalation part and all patients with  PDGFRA D842V-mutant gastrointestinal stromal tumour in the dose-expansion part,  and activity was assessed in all patients with PDGFRA D842V-mutant  gastrointestinal stromal tumour who received avapritinib and who had at least  one target lesion and at least one post-baseline disease assessment by central  radiology. This study is registered with ClinicalTrials.gov, NCT02508532. FINDINGS: Between Oct 26, 2015, and Nov 16, 2018 (data cutoff), 46 patients were  enrolled in the dose-escalation part, including 20 patients with a PDGFRA  D842V-mutant gastrointestinal stromal tumour, and 36 patients with a PDGFRA  D842V-mutant gastrointestinal stromal tumour were enrolled in the dose-expansion  part. At data cutoff (Nov 16, 2018), 38 (46%) of 82 patients in the safety  population (median follow-up of 19·1 months [IQR 9·2-25·5]) and 37 (66%) of the  56 patients in the PDGFRA D842V population (median follow-up of 15·9 months [IQR  9·2-24·9]) remained on treatment. The maximum tolerated dose was 400 mg, and the  recommended phase 2 dose was 300 mg. In the safety population (patients with  PDGFRA D842V-mutant gastrointestinal stromal tumour from the dose-escalation and  dose-expansion parts, all doses), treatment-related grade 3-4 events occurred in  47 (57%) of 82 patients, the most common being anaemia (14 [17%]); there were no  treatment-related deaths. In the PDGFRA D842V-mutant population, 49 (88%; 95% CI  76-95) of 56 patients had an overall response, with five (9%) complete responses  and 44 (79%) partial responses. No dose-limiting toxicities were observed at  doses of 30-400 mg per day. At 600 mg, two patients had dose-limiting toxicities  (grade 2 hypertension, dermatitis acneiform, and memory impairment in patient 1,  and grade 2 hyperbilirubinaemia in patient 2). INTERPRETATION: Avapritinib has a manageable safety profile and has preliminary  antitumour activity in patients with advanced PDGFRA D842V-mutant  gastrointestinal stromal tumours.

Recent years have seen the development of selective CDK4/6 inhibitors, which  have delivered promising preclinical and clinical results in breast cancer and  other tumours. A number of trials assessing antitumour efficacy in various  disease settings and combinations are ongoing. The cyclin D1-CDK-Rb axis and its  role in the cell cycle of normal and cancer cells are delineated. The early  pan-CDK inhibitor flavopiridol and subsequent preclinical and clinical  development of selective CDK4/6 inhibitors are described. Ongoing studies in  breast cancer with novel CDK4/6 inhibitors (palbociclib, abemaciclib and  ribociclib) are explored. A literature search of these topics was performed  through PubMed. Abstracts from major oncology meetings were also reviewed.  Selective CDK4/6 inhibitors, as represented by the competing compounds currently  in clinical development, comprise a novel, safe and, thus far, promisingly  efficacious group of drugs. Considerable resources are being devoted towards  exploring the efficacy of these drugs in combination with endocrine therapies,  an approach that has yielded encouraging results and accelerated approval by the  US Food and Drugs Administration for one of these agents (palbociclib). The  results of confirmatory phase 3 trials are, however, awaited. We discuss further  therapy combinations in development and highlight potential areas for caution  including the potential for antagonistic interactions with cytotoxic  chemotherapies.', 'Bruton tyrosine kinase (BTK) plays an important role in the B-cell receptor  (BCR) signaling pathway by mediating proliferation, migration and adhesion in  B-cell malignancies. Therefore, the components of BCR signaling, especially BTK,  are considered to be attractive therapeutic targets. Ibrutinib, a first-in-class  BTK inhibitor, has been approved for the treatment of several types of B-cell  malignancies worldwide. However, ibrutinib has off-target activities on non-BTK  kinase that are related to adverse effects or might translate into clinical  limitations. To overcome these limitations, more specific BTK inhibitors are  needed. Tirabrutinib hydrochloride (tirabrutinib) is a potent, highly selective,  irreversible oral inhibitor of BTK. Tirabrutinib irreversibly and covalently  binds to BTK in B cells and has demonstrated effective in vitro cytotoxicity in  many types of B-cell malignancies and in vivo antitumor activity in mouse  models. Here, we provide a comprehensive review of the preclinical and clinical  activity of tirabrutinib, a drug approved in Japan for relapsed or refractory  primary central nervous system lymphoma and all lines of Waldenström  macroglobulinemia/lymphoplasmacytic lymphoma.', 'PURPOSE: Although histone deacetylase inhibitors (HDACi) are emerging as a new  class of anticancer agents, one of the most significant concerns is that  interactions with a wide array of substrates using these agents might initiate  both therapeutic and undesired protective responses. Here, we sought to identify  the potential protective reactions initiated by HDACi and determine whether  targeting these reactions would enhance the antitumoral activity of HDACi. EXPERIMENTAL DESIGN: Gene expression profiles were analyzed by cDNA microarray  in Molt-4 cells before and after treatment of vorinostat. Induction of CD146 by  vorinostat was examined in a wide range of tumors and nonmalignant cells. AA98,  an anti-CD146 monoclonal antibody, was used to target CD146 function.  Synergistic antitumoral and antiangiogenic effects between AA98 and vorinostat  were examined both in vitro and in vivo. The potential effect of combined AA98  and vorinostat treatment on the AKT pathway was determined by Western blotting. RESULTS: The induction of CD146 is a common phenomenon in vorinostat-treated  cancer but not in nonmalignant cells. Targeting of CD146 with AA98 substantially  enhanced vorinostat-induced killing via the suppression of activation of AKT  pathways in cancer cells. Moreover, AA98 in combination with vorinostat  significantly inhibited angiogenesis. In vivo, AA98 synergized with vorinostat  to inhibit tumor growth and metastasis. CONCLUSION: The present study provided the first evidence that an undesired  induction of CD146 could serve as a protective response to offset the antitumor  efficacy of vorinostat. On the other hand, targeting CD146 in combination with  vorinostat could be exploited as a novel strategy to more effectively kill  cancer cells.', 'The concept of molecular tumor targeting might provide new hope in the treatment  of advanced prostate cancer. We evaluated metastasis blocking properties of the  histone deacetylase (HDAC) inhibitor valproic acid (VPA) and the mammalian  target of rapamycin (mTOR) inhibitor RAD001 on prostate cancer cell lines.  RAD001 or VPA were applied to PC-3 or LNCaP cells, either separately or in  combination. Adhesion to vascular endothelium or to immobilized collagen,  fibronectin or laminin was quantified. Migration and invasion were explored by a  modified Boyden chamber assay. Integrin α and β subtypes were analyzed by flow  cytometry, western blotting and RT-PCR. Effects of drug treatment on integrin  related signaling, Akt and p70S6kinase activation, histone H3 and H4 acetylation  were also determined. Separate application of RAD001 or VPA distinctly reduced  tumor cell adhesion, migration and invasion, accompanied by elevated Akt  activation and p70S6kinase de-activation. Integrin subtype expression was  altered significantly by both compounds (VPA > RAD001). When both drugs were  used in concert additive effects were observed on the migratory and invasive  behavior but not on tumor-endothelium and tumor-matrix interaction. Separate  mTOR or HDAC inhibition slows processes related to tumor metastasis. The  RAD001-VPA combination showed advantage over VPA monotreatment with particular  respect to migration and invasion. Ongoing studies are required to assess the  relevance of VPA monotherapy versus VPA-RAD001 combination on tumor cell  motility.', 'BACKGROUND: Whereas many new targets for drug discovery have been identified  from new biology, such as that from the Human Genome Project, some targets have  been known for decades but have not been exploited. OBJECTIVE: One such target, selective thyromimetics, is reviewed from a  historical perspective and in the light of recent developments. METHODS: The history of thyromimetics in atherosclerosis and dyslipidaemia is  reviewed as the background to the recent publication of the first human data on  a new selective thyromimetic, KB-2115 (eprotirome). CONCLUSION: The published data provide proof of concept/mechanism, opening the  way to larger studies in a wider range of subjects and in combination with  statins.']",Avapritinib is a novel inhibitor of KIT/PDGFRA.

10,What is the function of Circular RNA (circRNA)?,"['Circular RNAs (circRNAs) are noncoding RNAs that form covalently closed loop  structures. CircRNAs are dysregulated in cancer and play key roles in  tumorigenesis, diagnosis, and tumor therapy. CircRNAs function as competing  endogenous RNAs or microRNA sponges that regulate transcription and splicing,  binding to proteins, and translation. CircRNAs may serve as novel biomarkers for  cancer diagnosis, and they show potential as therapeutic targets in cancers  including breast cancer (BC). In women, BC is the most common malignant tumor  worldwide and the second leading cause of cancer death. Although evidence  indicates that circRNAs play a critical role in BC, the mechanisms regulating  the function of circRNAs in BC remain poorly understood. Here, we provide  literature review aiming to clarify the role of circRNAs in BC and summarize the  latest research. We provide a systematic overview of the biogenesis and  biological functions of circRNAs, elaborate on the functional roles of circRNAs  in BC, and highlight the value of circRNAs as diagnostic and therapeutic targets  in BC.', ""Circular RNAs (circRNAs) are a novel type of universal and diverse endogenous  noncoding RNAs (ncRNAs) and they form a covalently closed continuous loop  without 5' or 3' tails unlike linear RNAs. Most circRNAs are presented with  characteristics of abundance, stability, conservatism, and often exhibiting  tissue/developmental-stage-specific expression. CircRNAs are generated either  from exons or introns by back splicing or lariat introns. CircRNAs play  important roles as miRNA sponges, gene transcription and expression regulators,  RNA-binding protein (RBP) sponges and protein/peptide translators. Emerging  evidence revealed the function of circRNAs in cancer and may potentially serve  as a required novel biomarker and therapeutic target for cancer treatment. In  this review, we discuss about the origins, characteristics and functions of  circRNA and how they work as miRNA sponges, gene transcription and expression  regulators, RBP sponges in cancer as well as current research methods of  circRNAs, providing evidence for the significance of circRNAs in cancer  diagnosis and clinical treatment."", ""Circular RNAs (circRNAs) are important for the development and regeneration of  the nervous system. We investigated the differential expression profiles of  circRNA induced by spinal cord injury and reported that circRNA_01477  facilitates spinal astrocyte proliferation and migration after injury in rats.  In this study, we further clarified the function and possible mechanism of  action of circRNA_01477 in neurons. Fluorescence in situ hybridization assay  revealed that circRNA_01477 is mainly localized in the neuronal cytoplasm.  Knockdown of circRNA_01477 significantly increased axonal length. The  circRNA_01477/microRNAs (miRNA)/messenger RNA (mRNA) interaction network was  investigated using RNA sequencing. miRNA-3075 showed a remarkable increase after  circRNA_01477 depletion, and either overexpression of miRNA-3075 or  downregulation of its target gene FosB significantly promoted axonal growth.  Luciferase reporter assay showed that miRNA-3075 could directly bind to the  3'UTR of FosB and negatively regulated FosB transcription. Dual silencing of  circRNA_01477 and miR-3075 revealed that miR-3075 inhibition rescued the  increased axon length caused by siCircRNA_01477. Finally, we verified that the  Stat3 pathway was activated after FosB protein depletion in rat spinal neurons,  while the NF-κB pathway was not altered. In summary, our study is the first to  report that circRNA_01477 contributes to axon growth by functioning as miRNA  sponge by regulating the miRNA-3075/FosB/Stat3 axis."", 'Author information: (1)College of Bioinformatics Science and Technology, Harbin Medical University,  Harbin 150081, China. bioccwsy@gmail.com.

While independent studies confirm the  expression of circRNA in various tissue types, genome-wide circRNA expression in  the heart has yet to be described in detail. METHODS AND RESULTS: We performed deep RNA-sequencing on ribosomal-depleted RNA  isolated from 12 human hearts, 25 mouse hearts and across a 28-day  differentiation time-course of human embryonic stem cell-derived cardiomyocytes.  Using purpose-designed bioinformatics tools, we uncovered a total of 15\u2009318 and  3017 cardiac circRNA within human and mouse, respectively. Their abundance  generally correlates with the abundance of their cognate linear RNA, but  selected circRNAs exist at disproportionately higher abundance. Top highly  expressed circRNA corresponded to key cardiac genes including Titin (TTN), RYR2,  and DMD. The most abundant cardiac-expressed circRNA is a cytoplasmic localized  single-exon circSLC8A1-1. The longest human transcript TTN alone generates up to  415 different exonic circRNA isoforms, the majority (83%) of which originates  from the I-band domain. Finally, we confirmed the expression of selected cardiac  circRNA by RT-PCR, Sanger sequencing and single molecule RNA-fluorescence in  situ hybridization. CONCLUSIONS: Our data provide a detailed circRNA expression landscape in hearts.  There is a high-abundance of specific cardiac-expressed circRNA. These findings  open up a new avenue for future investigation into this emerging class of RNA.', 'Circular RNAs (circRNAs) are long, non-coding RNAs that result from the  non-canonical splicing of linear pre-mRNAs. However, the characteristics and the  critical role of circRNA in co-/post-transcriptional regulation were not well  recognized until the ""microRNA sponge"" function of circRNA is discovered. Recent  studies have mainly been devoted to the function of the circular RNA sponge for  miR-7 (ciRS-7) and sex-determining region Y (SRY) by targeting microRNA-7  (miR-7) and microRNA-138 (miR-138), respectively. In this review, we illustrate  the specific role of circRNAs in a wide variety of cancers and in regulating the  biological behavior of cancers via miR-7 or miR-138 regulation. Furthermore,  circRNA, together with its gene silencing ability, also shows its potential in  RNA interference (RNAi) therapy by binding to target RNAs, which provides a  novel perspective in cancer treatment. Thus, this review concerns the  biogenesis, biological function, oncogenesis, progression and possible therapies  for cancer involving circRNAs.', ""Circular RNAs (circRNAs) are a class of noncoding RNAs (ncRNAs) that form  covalently closed continuous loop structures, lacking the terminal 5' and 3'  ends. CircRNAs are generated in the process of back-splicing and can originate  from different genomic regions. Their unique circular structure makes circRNAs  more stable than linear RNAs. In addition, they also display insensitivity to  ribonuclease activity. Generally, circRNAs function as microRNA (miRNA) sponges  and have a regulatory role in transcription and translation. They may be also  translated in a cap-independent manner in vivo, to generate specific proteins.  In the last decade, next-generation sequencing techniques, especially RNA-seq,  have revealed great abundance and also dysregulation of many circRNAs in various  diseases, suggesting their involvement in disease development and progression.  Regarding their high stability and relatively specific differential expression  patterns in tissues and extracellular environment (e.g., body fluids), they are  regarded as promising novel biomarkers in cancer.

A  downstream 5' splice site is linked to an upstream 3' splice site to form a  circular transcript instead of a canonical linear transcript. Recent advances in  next-generation sequencing (NGS) have brought circRNAs back into the focus of  many scientists. Since then, several studies reported that circRNAs are  differentially expressed across tissue types and developmental stages, implying  that they are actively regulated and not merely a by-product of splicing.

Currently, most  computational prediction pipelines use back-spliced reads to identify circular  RNAs. FUCHS extends this concept by considering all RNA-seq information from  long reads (typically >150 bp) to learn more about the exon coverage, the number  of double break point fragments, the different circular isoforms arising from  one host-gene, and the alternatively spliced exons within the same circRNA  boundaries.

11,Where is X-ray free electron laser used?,"['The recent development of x-ray free electron lasers providing coherent,  femtosecond-long pulses of high brilliance and variable energy opens new areas  of scientific research in a variety of disciplines such as physics, chemistry,  and biology. Pump-probe experimental techniques which observe the temporal  evolution of systems after optical or x-ray pulse excitation are one of the main  experimental schemes currently in use for ultrafast studies. The key challenge  in these experiments is to reliably achieve temporal and spatial overlap of the  x-ray and optical pulses. Here we present measurements of the x-ray pulse  induced transient change of optical reflectivity from a variety of materials  covering the soft x-ray photon energy range from 500eV to 2000eV and outline the  use of this technique to establish and characterize temporal synchronization of  the optical-laser and FEL x-ray pulses.', 'X-ray free-electron lasers (XFELs) generate sequences of ultra-short spatially  coherent pulses of X-ray radiation. A diffraction focusing spectrometer (DFS),  which is able to measure the whole energy spectrum of the radiation of a single  XFEL pulse with an energy resolution of ΔE/E 2 × 10(-6), is proposed. This is  much better than for most modern X-ray spectrometers. Such resolution allows one  to resolve the fine spectral structure of the XFEL pulse. The effect of  diffraction focusing occurs in a single-crystal plate due to dynamical  scattering, and is similar to focusing in a Pendry lens made from a metamaterial  with a negative refraction index. Such a spectrometer is easier to operate than  those based on bent crystals. It is shown that the DFS can be used in a wide  energy range from 5 keV to 20 keV.', 'The short and intense pulses of the new X-ray free electron lasers, now  operational or under construction, may make possible diffraction experiments on  single molecule-sized objects with high resolution, before radiation damage  destroys the sample. In a single molecule imaging (SMI) experiment thousands of  diffraction patterns of single molecules with random orientations are recorded.  One of the most challenging problems of SMI is how to assemble these noisy  patterns of unknown orientations into a consistent single set of diffraction  data. Here we present a new method which can solve the orientation problem of  SMI efficiently even for large biological molecules and in the presence of  noise. We show on simulated diffraction patterns of a large protein molecule,  how the orientations of the patterns can be found and the structure to atomic  resolution can be solved. The concept of our algorithm could be also applied to  experiments where images of an object are recorded in unknown orientations  and/or positions like in cryoEM or tomography.', 'The emergence of femtosecond diffractive imaging with X-ray lasers has enabled  pioneering structural studies of isolated particles, such as viruses, at  nanometer length scales. However, the issue of missing low frequency data  significantly limits the potential of X-ray lasers to reveal sub-nanometer  details of micrometer-sized samples. We have developed a new technique of  dark-field coherent diffractive imaging to simultaneously overcome the missing  data issue and enable us to harness the unique contrast mechanisms available in  dark-field microscopy. Images of airborne particulate matter (soot) up to two  microns in length were obtained using single-shot diffraction patterns obtained  at the Linac Coherent Light Source, four times the size of objects previously  imaged in similar experiments. This technique opens the door to femtosecond  diffractive imaging of a wide range of micrometer-sized materials that exhibit  irreproducible complexity down to the nanoscale, including airborne particulate  matter, small cells, bacteria and gold-labeled biological samples.', 'We demonstrate the use of an X-ray free electron laser synchronized with an  optical pump laser to obtain X-ray diffraction snapshots from the photoactivated  states of large membrane protein complexes in the form of nanocrystals flowing  in a liquid jet. Light-induced changes of Photosystem I-Ferredoxin co-crystals  were observed at time delays of 5 to 10 µs after excitation. The result  correlates with the microsecond kinetics of electron transfer from Photosystem I  to ferredoxin. The undocking process that follows the electron transfer leads to  large rearrangements in the crystals that will terminally lead to the  disintegration of the crystals. We describe the experimental setup and obtain  the first time-resolved femtosecond serial X-ray crystallography results from an  irreversible photo-chemical reaction at the Linac Coherent Light Source. This  technique opens the door to time-resolved structural studies of reaction  dynamics in biological systems.', 'Coherent x-ray diffraction microscopy is a method of imaging nonperiodic  isolated objects at resolutions limited, in principle, by only the wavelength  and largest scattering angles recorded. We demonstrate x-ray diffraction imaging  with high resolution in all three dimensions, as determined by a quantitative  analysis of the reconstructed volume images. These images are retrieved from the  three-dimensional diffraction data using no a priori knowledge about the shape  or composition of the object, which has never before been demonstrated on a  nonperiodic object. We also construct two-dimensional images of thick objects  with greatly increased depth of focus (without loss of transverse spatial  resolution). These methods can be used to image biological and materials science  samples at high resolution with x-ray undulator radiation and establishes the  techniques to be used in atomic-resolution ultrafast imaging at x-ray  free-electron laser sources.', 'The multiwavelength anomalous diffraction (MAD) method is used to determine  phase information in x-ray crystallography by employing anomalous scattering  from heavy atoms. X-ray free-electron lasers (FELs) show promise for revealing  the structure of single molecules or nanocrystals, but the phase problem remains  largely unsolved. Because of the ultrabrightness of x-ray FEL, samples  experience severe electronic radiation damage, especially to heavy atoms, which  hinders direct implementation of MAD with x-ray FELs. Here, we propose a  generalized version of MAD phasing at high x-ray intensity. We demonstrate the  existence of a Karle-Hendrickson-type equation in the high-intensity regime and  calculate relevant coefficients with detailed electronic damage dynamics of  heavy atoms.

However, during an  imaging pulse, the fast laser-induced ionization may strongly affect the  recorded diffraction pattern of the irradiated sample. The radiation tolerance  of the imaged molecule should then be investigated a priori with a dedicated  simulation tool. The continuum approach is a powerful tool for modeling the  evolution of irradiated large systems consisting of more than a few hundred  thousand atoms. However, this method follows the evolution of average  single-particle densities, and the experimentally recorded intensities reflect  the spatial two-particle correlations. The information on these correlations is  then inherently not accessible within the continuum approach. In this paper we  analyze this limitation of continuum models and discuss the applicability of  continuum models for imaging studies. We derive a formula to calculate scattered  intensities (including both elastic and inelastic scattering) from the estimates  obtained with a single-particle continuum model under conditions typical for CDI  studies with XFELs. We demonstrate through numerical simulations that it  describes the scattered signal with good accuracy. Two-particle correlation  effects manifest themselves only in the region of low momentum transfers,  together with the effects of the finite size of the sample. We also show that  inelastic scattering on bound electrons can have a significant impact on the  measured intensities: it contributes to the background that reduces the contrast  of the recorded image. This effect is even more pronounced at larger momentum  transfers. Therefore, whereas inelastic scattering can be neglected for  nanocrystals, where Bragg scattering dominates, and in experiments imaging  single objects at low resolution, it should be taken into account when planning  atomic resolution imaging of nonperiodic samples. Finally, we show the effect of  the electronic damage on the recorded total signal. Progressing damage does not  change the positions of intensity peaks that correspond to the (fixed) positions  of imaged ions. It only changes the contrast between intensity minima and  maxima, which reduces the image contrast. Our results have implications for  imaging-oriented studies of radiation damage performed with continuum models, as  they define the limits of applicability of these models for CDI simulations.', 'A multi-crystal wavelength dispersive hard x-ray spectrometer with high-energy  resolution and large solid angle collection is described. The instrument is  specifically designed for time-resolved applications of x-ray emission  spectroscopy (XES) and x-ray Raman scattering (XRS) at X-ray Free Electron  Lasers (XFEL) and synchrotron radiation facilities. It also simplifies resonant  inelastic x-ray scattering (RIXS) studies of the whole 2d RIXS plane. The  spectrometer is based on the Von Hamos geometry. This dispersive setup enables  an XES or XRS spectrum to be measured in a single-shot mode, overcoming the  scanning needs of the Rowland circle spectrometers. In conjunction with the XFEL  temporal profile and high-flux, it is a powerful tool for studying the dynamics  of time-dependent systems. Photo-induced processes and fast catalytic reaction  kinetics, ranging from femtoseconds to milliseconds, will be resolvable in a  wide array of systems circumventing radiation damage.']","X-ray free electron laser (XFEL) technologies provide coherent and extremely intense photon pulses of short duration. XFELs are particularly useful in structural biology and imaging, in structural studies of single biological macromolecules (e.g. high resolution protein structure determination) and assemblies (e.g. viruses) or nanocrystals, which are not amenable to investigation with traditional crystallographic methods. Moreover, XFELs have the potential to be used for studying enzyme kinetics."
12,What is holoprosencephaly?,"['BACKGROUND: Holoprosencephaly is a structural anomaly of the brain that consists  in a defect of the prosencephalon development that leads to face and  neurological defects of variable intensity. AIM: To estimate holoprosencephaly prevalence at birth. PATIENTS AND METHODS: All cases of holoprosencephaly, born alive or stillbirths,  registered in the 15 Chilean Hospitals of the Latin American Collaborative Study  of Congenital Malformations (ECLAMC) between 1972 and 2012, were studied.  Craniofacial and other anomalies found in newborns affected by holoprosencephaly  are described. RESULTS: Fifty five cases of holoprosencephaly (58% males) were found among the  798.222 registered births (rendering a prevalence at birth of 0.69 per 10.000  newborns). The most common cranial defect was medial cleft lip with cleft palate  (27.3%), bilateral cleft lip (11%) or both (38.2%), cyclopia (14%), single  nostril (10.9%) and proboscis (9.1%). Eleven percent cases had a trisomy 13. A  slight increase in prevalence over time was observed. CONCLUSIONS: Holoprosencephaly has a low frequency in Chile and is associated to  trisomy 13. The increase in prevalence could be explained by a better prenatal  diagnosis (ultrasonography).', 'Holoprosencephaly is a brain anomaly of varying severity with associated  extracranial, symptomatic abnormalities in only a minority of cases. The class  of brain defects known as holoprosencephaly represents a continuum usually  divided into three types: alobar, semilobar, and lobar. Each has both  distinctive radiological characteristics and some similarities. Typical facial  anomalies are found in the severe forms. Absent septum pellucidum and  septo-optic dysplasia, possibly of similar embryological origin, have some  resemblances to lobar holoprosencephaly, but are clinically and radiologically  separate in most instances. Agenesis of the corpus callosum, which is  superficially like holoprosencephaly, should not be confused with the  prosencephalic defects.', 'Structural malformations of the brain are an important cause of childhood  mortality and morbidity, with the latter having long-term financial and  psychosocial implications for the affected child and family. Holoprosencephaly  (HPE) is a severe brain malformation characterized by abnormal cleavage of the  prosencephalon in the 5th gestational week. Aprosencephaly and atelencephaly  occur earlier because of failure in the formation of the prosencephalon and  telencephalon, respectively. The HPE holoprosencephaly spectrum classically  includes alobar, semilobar, and lobar forms, although there are no clear-cut  defining features. The middle interhemispheric variant (MIH), also known as  syntelencephaly, is classified as a variant of HPE holoprosencephaly with  midline interhemispheric fusion. Other conditions sometimes included in the  spectrum of HPE holoprosencephaly include septo-optic dysplasia (SOD); ""minimal""  HPE holoprosencephaly , which is associated with subtle craniofacial  malformations and mild developmental delay; and microform HPE holoprosencephaly  , which by definition excludes brain involvement. The focus of this article will  be on the spectrum of findings visible in fetal manifestation of the HPE  holoprosencephaly spectrum. Brain embryology; the imaging characteristics,  epidemiology, and embryology of HPE; and the more common associated anomalies,  particularly those of the face (""the face predicts the brain"") are reviewed.  Recognition of these anomalies is important for accurate parental counseling,  since the prognosis is poor but not invariably lethal; children with the milder  forms may live well into their teens with severe developmental delays, endocrine  dysfunction, and disrupted homeostasis. Available data on outcome in surviving  children are summarized. Illustrative fetal ultrasonographic and magnetic  resonance images are presented with clinical, autopsy, and postnatal imaging  correlation.', 'Holoprosencephaly is a brain malformation that develops as a result of a defect  in development of prosencephalon during early gestation. Holoprosencephaly can  be diagnosed with prenatal ultrasonography and magnetic resonance imaging. We  report herein a case with cyclopia and holoprosencephaly detected by prenatal  ultrasonography.', 'Holoprosencephaly (HPE) is the most common developmental defect of the forebrain  characterized by inadequate or absent midline division of the forebrain into  cerebral hemispheres, with concomitant midline facial defects in the majority of  cases. Understanding the pathogenesis of HPE requires knowledge of the  relationship between the developing brain and the facial structures during  embryogenesis. A number of signaling pathways control and coordinate the  development of the brain and face, including Sonic hedgehog, Bone morphogenetic  protein, Fibroblast growth factor, and Nodal signaling. Mutations in these  pathways have been identified in animal models of HPE and human patients.  Because of incomplete penetrance and variable expressivity of HPE, patients  carrying defined mutations may not manifest the disease at all, or have a  spectrum of defects. It is currently unknown what drives manifestation of HPE in  genetically at-risk individuals, but it has been speculated that other gene  mutations and environmental factors may combine as cumulative insults. HPE can  be diagnosed in utero by a high-resolution prenatal ultrasound or a fetal  magnetic resonance imaging, sometimes in combination with molecular testing from  chorionic villi or amniotic fluid sampling. Currently, there are no effective  preventive methods for HPE. Better understanding of the mechanisms of  gene-environment interactions in HPE would provide avenues for such  interventions.', 'Cebocephaly is a very rare congenital anomaly combining a severe midline facial  malformation and holoprosencephaly.

Though a few cases have been reported from other  parts of the world, to the best of our knowledge none has been reported from  India so far. Maternal alcoholism is regarded as an important factor causing  holoprosencephaly. Disruption of the Shh gene signaling pathway is also said to  be a factor for the occurrence of holoprosencephaly as well as left right  asymmetry. Though several factors are suspected as a cause of this deformity,  the precise aetiopathogenesis is still under debate. Lack of knowledge might be  due to paucity of data from cases due to its rarity. Hereby, we are presenting a  case of agnathia, holoprosencephaly and situs inversus born at 32 wk of  gestation by an alcoholic mother. Externally the child had agnathia and  cyclopia. There was no mandible or any oral cavity. It was accompanied by  noticeable limb deformity. Internally there was holoprosencephaly, situs  inversus totalis with several visceral abnormalities.

13,What is Pseudomelanosis duodeni?,"['Pseudomelanosis duodeni is an uncommon endoscopic sign characterized by diffuse  small black spots on the first and second portions of the duodenum. It occurs  predominantly in female and elderly patients and is linked to chronic illnesses  and related medications. Between 1988 and 1994, the authors saw eight patients  with pseudomelanosis duodeni. To evaluate the nature of the pigments, special  staining was performed in seven cases. Iron stain was strongly positive in three  cases. Electron microscopy was performed in two cases. This revealed amorphous  bodies within macrophage lysosomes in one case and angular crystals in another  case. These tests suggest that in pseudomelanosis duodeni iron metabolism may be  impaired and iron is pooled within macrophages.', 'Pseudomelanosis duodeni is a rare condition in which dark pigment accumulates in  macrophages located in the lamina propria of the duodenal mucosa. Three cases  are reported here and the literature is reviewed. No clinical association can be  found that points clearly to the underlying etiology. Electron probe x-ray  microanalysis was used to study the pigment in macrophage granules in 2 of our  patients and demonstrated high iron and sulfur content. Iron accumulation in  ferritinlike particles was detected in absorptive cell lysosomes. A possible  mechanism for the accumulation of absorbed iron by macrophages is considered.', 'We present the first reported case with typical endoscopic and histological  findings from Thailand. An 80-year-old man presented with chronic periumbilical  abdominal pain for 3 months and melena for one week. He had had hypertension for  17 years, chronic renal failure for 4 years and gouty arthritis for 3 years.  Panendoscopy was done and showed diffusely scattered small black and brown  pigmentation over the stomach and duodenum. Tissue biopsies from the black  pigmented lesions were taken for further microscopic and histochemical  evaluation. Histological finding and special histochemical stains, Fontana  stain, revealed mild chronic inflammation with accumulation of hemosiderin  pigment in the lamina propria of the stomach and duodenal villi.

Here, we describe the case of an  83-year-old female, with a complicated medical history, who was referred to  gastroenterologist to assess bleeding risk. From the endoscopy, it was  determined that she had both melanosis gastri and duodeni.

Collections of pigment-laden macrophages are found in the tips of duodenal  villi. The pigment is thought to be mostly composed of ferrous sulfide.  Histochemichal stains for iron (Perl's prussian blue) or melanin  (Masson-Fontana) may be positive, but are usually negative or unpredictable.  Duodenal pseudomelanosis occurs predominantly in middle-aged to old adults and  more commonly in females. It is associated with chronic renal failure, arterial  hypertension, diabetes mellitus and gastrointestinal bleeding.

One such disorder, Waardenburg syndrome  (WS), is a mendelian trait characterized by hypopigmentation and sensorineural  deafness. It is commonly subdivided into four types (WS1-4), defined by the  presence or absence of additional symptoms. WS type 4 (WS4), or Shah-Waardenburg  syndrome, is also known as Hirschsprung disease Type II (HSCR II) and is  characterized by an absence of epidermal melanocytes and enteric ganglia.  Mutations in the genes encoding the endothelin type-B receptor (EDNRB) and its  physiological ligand endothelin 3 (EDN3) are now known to account for the  majority of HSCR II patients. Null mutations in the mouse genes Ednrb and Edn3  have identified a key role for this pathway in the normal development of  melanocytes and other neural crest-derived lineages. The pleiotropic effects of  genes in this pathway, on melanocyte and enteric neuron development, have been  clarified by the embryologic identification of their common neural crest (NC)  ancestry. EDNRB and EDN3 are transiently expressed in crest-derived melanoblast  and neuroblast precursors, and in the surrounding mesenchymal cells,  respectively. The influence of EDNRB-mediated signaling on the emigration,  migration, proliferation, and differentiation of melanocyte and enteric neuron  precursors, in vivo and in vitro has recently been the subject of great  scrutiny. A major emergent theme is that EDN3-induced signaling prevents the  premature differentiation of melanocyte and enteric nervous system precursors  and is essential between 10 and 12.5 days post-coitum. We review the present  understanding of pigment cell development in the context of EDNRB/EDN3--a  receptor-mediated pathway with pleiotropic effects.', ""Hirschsprung's disease is an inherited disorder characterized by the absence of  ganglion cells in the distal bowel.

14,What is the multisystem inflammatory syndrome in children (MIS-C) associated with COVID-19?,"['OBJECTIVE: Although the initial reports of COVID-19 cases in children described  that children were largely protected from severe manifestations, clusters of  paediatric cases of severe systemic hyperinflammation and shock related to  severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 infection began to be reported  in the latter half of April 2020. A novel syndrome called ""multisystem  inflammatory syndrome in children"" (MIS-C) shares common clinical features with  other well-defined syndromes, including Kawasaki disease, toxic shock syndrome  and secondary hemophagocytic lymphohistiocytosis/macrophage activation syndrome.  Our objective was to develop a protocol for the evaluation, treatment and  follow-up of patients with MIS-C. METHODS: The protocol was developed by a multidisciplinary team. We convened a  multidisciplinary working group with representation from the departments of  paediatric critical care, cardiology, rheumatology, surgery, gastroenterology,  haematology, immunology, infectious disease and neurology. Our protocol and  recommendations were based on the literature and our experiences with  multisystem inflammatory syndrome in children. After an agreement was reached  and the protocol was implemented, revisions were made on the basis of expert  feedback. CONCLUSION: Children may experience acute cardiac decompensation or other organ  system failure due to this severe inflammatory condition. Therefore, patients  with severe symptoms of MIS-C should be managed in a paediatric intensive care  setting, as rapid clinical deterioration may occur. Therapeutic approaches for  MIS-C should be tailored depending on the patients\' phenotypes. Plasmapheresis  may be useful as a standard treatment to control hypercytokinemia in cases of  MIS-C with severe symptoms. Long-term follow-up of patients with cardiac  involvement is required to identify any sequelae of MIS-C.', 'Multisystem inflammatory syndrome in children (MIS-C) is a novel,  life-threatening hyperinflammatory condition that develops in children a few  weeks after infection with severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus-2  (SARS-CoV-2). This disease has created a diagnostic challenge due to overlap  with Kawasaki disease (KD) and KD shock syndrome. The majority of patients with  MIS-C present with the involvement of at least four organ systems, and all have  evidence of a marked inflammatory state. Most patients show an increase in the  level of at least four inflammatory markers (C-reactive protein, neutrophil  count, ferritin, procalcitonin, fibrinogen, interleukin-6, and triglycerides).  Therapy is primarily with immunomodulators, suggesting that the disease is  driven by post-infectious immune dysregulation. Most patients, even those with  severe cardiovascular involvement, recover without sequelae. Since coronary  aneurysms have been reported, echocardiographic follow-up is needed.Further  study is needed to create uniform diagnostic criteria, therapy, and follow-up  protocols.', 'The coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic has impacted the health of  children worldwide. Although overall mortality from COVID-19 in children remains  low, an associated multisystem inflammatory disorder has emerged. The disorder  has been recognized and named multisystem inflammatory syndrome in children  (MIS-C) by the World Health Organization and the Centers for Disease Control and  Prevention. This comprehensive review describes the epidemiology,  pathophysiology, signs and symptoms, other potential diagnoses, and treatments  relevant to MIS-C. The review also includes patient and family education and  anticipatory guidance, and discusses nursing implications for nurses working in  various roles and settings, including direct care, research, and public health.', 'The coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic has caused widespread mortality  and morbidity. Though children are largely spared from severe illness, a novel  childhood hyperinflammatory syndrome presumed to be associated with and  subsequent to severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2)  infection has emerged with potentially severe outcomes. Multisystem inflammatory  disorder in children (MIS-C) most commonly affects young, school-aged children  and is characterized by persistent fever, systemic hyperinflammation, and  multisystem organ dysfunction. While uncommon and generally treatable, MIS-C  presents potentially life-altering medical sequelae, complicated by a dearth of  information regarding its etiology, pathophysiology, and long-term outcomes. The  severity of MIS-C may warrant the need for increased awareness and continued  COVID-19 mitigation efforts, particularly until potential factors conferring a  predisposition to MIS-C can be clarified through additional research.  Well-informed guidelines will be critical as the school year progresses. In this  article, current knowledge on MIS-C is reviewed and the potential implications  of this novel syndrome are discussed from a public health perspective.', 'BACKGROUND. A multisystem inflammatory syndrome in children (MIS-C) associated  with coronavirus disease (COVID-19) has recently been described. OBJECTIVE. The  purpose of our study was to evaluate the imaging findings of MIS-C associated  with COVID-19. METHODS. Imaging studies and medical records of patients (age  range, 0-20 years) admitted with MIS-C between April 22 and May 21, 2020, were  retrospectively reviewed. Thoracic imaging studies were evaluated for  parenchymal, mediastinal and hilar, and cardiovascular abnormalities. Abdominal  imaging studies were evaluated for abnormalities of solid viscera, hollow  viscera, and the peritoneum as well as the mesentery and retroperitoneum.  Studies were reviewed independently by two radiologists, and disagreements were  resolved by a third senior radiologist. RESULTS. Sixteen patients (10 male and  six female patients; age range, 20 months-20 years) were included in this study.  All 16 patients presented with fever. Other presenting signs and symptoms  included the following: vomiting (12/16, 75%), abdominal pain (11/16, 69%), rash  (10/16, 63%), conjunctivitis (8/16, 50%), diarrhea (7/16, 44%), headache (6/16,  38%), and sore throat (5/16, 31%). Shortness of breath and cough were each  present in one patient. Chest radiography showed cardiomegaly (10/16, 63%),  congestive heart failure or cardiogenic pulmonary edema (9/16, 56%), atelectasis  (9/16, 56%), pleural effusions (7/16, 44%), acute respiratory distress syndrome  (2/16, 13%), and pneumonia (1/16, 6%). Eight patients (50%) were evaluated for  pulmonary embolism (PE) (six [75%] by CT angiography [CTA] and two [25%] by  ventilation-perfusion scintigraphy). In two of the eight patients (25%), CTA  showed a segmental PE. Abdominal imaging findings (ultrasound, CT, and  radiography) included small-volume ascites (6/16, 38%), hepatomegaly (6/16,  38%), echogenic kidneys (5/16, 31%), bowel wall thickening (3/16, 19%),  gallbladder wall thickening (3/16, 19%), mesenteric lymphadenopathy (2/16, 13%),  splenomegaly (1/16, 6%), and bladder wall thickening (1/16, 6%). The frequencies  of findings based on all the reviewed modalities were as follows: cardiomegaly  (12/16, 75%), pleural effusion (10/16, 63%), and atelectasis (10/16, 63%).  Absolute interobserver agreement was 0.69-1 for thoracic findings and 0.17-1 for  abdominal findings. Fifteen patients (94%) were discharged from the hospital  (length of hospital stay: range, 3-20 days), and one patient remained in the  hospital at the end of the study period. There were no mortalities. CONCLUSION.  MIS-C associated with COVID-19 is characterized predominantly by cardiovascular  abnormalities, although solid visceral organ, gallbladder, and bowel  abnormalities as well as ascites are also seen, reflecting a multisystemic  inflammatory process. CLINICAL IMPACT. The constellation of imaging findings in  the setting of COVID-19 may alert radiologists to the diagnosis of MIS-C before  rapid deterioration of patients.', 'BACKGROUND: Multisystem inflammatory syndrome temporally associated with  COVID-19 (MIS-C) has been described as a novel and often severe presentation of  SARS-CoV-2 infection in children. We aimed to describe the characteristics of  children admitted to Pediatric Intensive Care Units (PICUs) presenting with  MIS-C in comparison with those admitted with SARS-CoV-2 infection with other  features such as COVID-19 pneumonia. METHODS: A multicentric prospective national registry including 47 PICUs was  carried out. Data from children admitted with confirmed SARS-CoV-2 infection or  fulfilling MIS-C criteria (with or without SARS-CoV-2 PCR confirmation) were  collected. Clinical, laboratory and therapeutic features between MIS-C and  non-MIS-C patients were compared. RESULTS: Seventy-four children were recruited. Sixty-one percent met MIS-C  definition. MIS-C patients were older than non-MIS-C patients (p\u2009=\u20090.002):  9.4\xa0years (IQR 5.5-11.8) vs 3.4\xa0years (IQR 0.4-9.4). A higher proportion of them  had no previous medical history of interest (88.2% vs 51.7%, p\u2009=\u20090.005).  Non-MIS-C patients presented more frequently with respiratory distress (60.7% vs  13.3%, p\u2009<\u20090.001). MIS-C patients showed higher prevalence of fever (95.6% vs  64.3%, p\u2009<\u20090.001), diarrhea (66.7% vs 11.5%, p\u2009<\u20090.001), vomits (71.1% vs 23.1%,  p\u2009=\u20090.001), fatigue (65.9% vs 36%, p\u2009=\u20090.016), shock (84.4% vs 13.8%, p\u2009<\u20090.001)  and cardiac dysfunction (53.3% vs 10.3%, p\u2009=\u20090.001). MIS-C group had a lower  lymphocyte count (p\u2009<\u20090.001) and LDH (p\u2009=\u20090.001) but higher neutrophil count  (p\u2009=\u20090.045), neutrophil/lymphocyte ratio (p\u2009<\u20090.001), C-reactive protein  (p\u2009<\u20090.001) and procalcitonin (p\u2009<\u20090.001). Patients in the MIS-C group were less  likely to receive invasive ventilation (13.3% vs 41.4%, p\u2009=\u20090.005) but were more  often treated with vasoactive drugs (66.7% vs 24.1%, p\u2009<\u20090.001), corticosteroids  (80% vs 44.8%, p\u2009=\u20090.003) and immunoglobulins (51.1% vs 6.9%, p\u2009<\u20090.001). Most  patients were discharged from PICU by the end of data collection with a median  length of stay of 5\xa0days (IQR 2.5-8\xa0days) in the MIS-C group. Three patients  died, none of them belonged to the MIS-C group. CONCLUSIONS: MIS-C seems to be the most frequent presentation among critically  ill children with SARS-CoV-2 infection. MIS-C patients are older and usually  healthy. They show a higher prevalence of gastrointestinal symptoms and shock  and are more likely to receive vasoactive drugs and immunomodulators and less  likely to need mechanical ventilation than non-MIS-C patients.', 'The World Health Organization is still revising the epidemiology of multi-system  inflammatory syndrome in children (MIS-C) and the preliminary case definition,  although there is a dearth of robust evidence regarding the clinical  presentations, severity, and outcomes. Researchers, epidemiologists, and  clinicians are struggling to characterize and describe the disease phenomenon  while taking care of the diseased persons at the forefronts. This report tackles  the first case of a 13-year-old Saudi female with the MIS-C mimicking Kawasaki  disease. Her main manifestations were fever, gastrointestinal symptoms, evidence  of organ failure with an increase in inflammatory markers, and a history of  coronavirus disease (COVID-19) infection. She had glucose-6-phosphate  dehydrogenase (G6PD) deficiency and no significant previous history of any  disease. She presented with signs of acute illness: high-grade fever (39.6°C)  for five days accompanied by sore throat, malaise, reduced oral intake,  abdominal pain, diarrhea, skin rash, bilateral non-suppurative conjunctivitis,  and erythematous, cracked lips. Eventually, she died despite aggressive  management based on the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention and the Saudi  Ministry of Health guidelines for COVID-19 management. Based on this case, we  suggest that pediatricians need to be aware of such atypical presentations and  early referral to tertiary care is imperative for further early diagnosis and  management. MIS-C is a rare yet severe and highly critical complication of  COVID-19 infection in pediatrics, leading to serious and life-threatening  illnesses. Knowledge about the wide spectrum of presenting signs and symptoms  and disease severity, including early detection and treatment, is pivotal to  prevent a tragic outcome.', 'BACKGROUND: Recently, cases of multisystem inflammatory syndrome in children  (MIS-C) associated with coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) have been reported  worldwide. Negative polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) testing associated with  positive serology in most of the cases suggests a postinfectious syndrome.  Because the pathophysiology of this syndrome is still poorly understood,  extensive virological and immunological investigations are needed. METHODS: We report a series of 4 pediatric patients admitted to Geneva  University Hospitals with persistent fever and laboratory evidence of  inflammation meeting the published definition of MIS-C related to COVID-19, to  whom an extensive virological and immunological workup was performed. RESULTS: RT-PCRs on multiple anatomical compartments were negative, whereas  anti-severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) immunoglobulin  A (IgA) and immunoglobulin G (IgG) were strongly positive by enzyme-linked  immunosorbent assay and immunofluorescence. Both pseudoneutralization and full  virus neutralization assays showed the presence of neutralizing antibodies in  all children, confirming a recent infection with SARS-CoV-2. The analyses of  cytokine profiles revealed an elevation in all cytokines, as reported in adults  with severe COVID-19. Although differing in clinical presentation, some features  of MIS-C show phenotypic overlap with hemophagocytic lymphohistiocytosis (HLH).  In contrast to patients with primary HLH, our patients showed normal perforin  expression and natural killer (NK) cell degranulation. The levels of soluble  interleukin (IL)-2 receptor (sIL-2R) correlated with the severity of disease,  reflecting recent T-cell activation. CONCLUSION: Our findings suggest that MIS-C related to COVID-19 is caused by a  postinfectious inflammatory syndrome associated with an elevation in all  cytokines, and markers of recent T-cell activation (sIL-2R) occurring despite a  strong and specific humoral response to SARS-CoV-2. Further functional and  genetic analyses are essential to better understand the mechanisms of  host-pathogen interactions.', 'Multisystem inflammatory syndrome in children (MIS-C) is a life-threatening  post-infectious complication occurring unpredictably weeks after mild or  asymptomatic SARS-CoV2 infection in otherwise healthy children. Here, we define  immune abnormalities in MIS-C compared to adult COVID-19 and pediatric/adult  healthy controls using single-cell RNA sequencing, antigen receptor repertoire  analysis, unbiased serum proteomics, and in vitro assays. Despite no evidence of  active infection, we uncover elevated S100A-family alarmins in myeloid cells and  marked enrichment of serum proteins that map to myeloid cells and pathways  including cytokines, complement/coagulation, and fluid shear stress in MIS-C  patients. Moreover, NK and CD8 T cell cytotoxicity genes are elevated, and  plasmablasts harboring IgG1 and IgG3 are expanded. Consistently, we detect  elevated binding of serum IgG from severe MIS-C patients to activated human  cardiac microvascular endothelial cells in culture. Thus, we define  immunopathology features of MIS-C with implications for predicting and managing  this SARS-CoV2-induced critical illness in children.', 'BACKGROUND. A multisystem inflammatory syndrome in children (MIS-C) associated  with coronavirus disease (COVID-19) has recently been described. OBJECTIVE. The  purpose of our study was to evaluate the imaging findings of MIS-C associated  with COVID-19. METHODS. Imaging studies and medical records of patients (age  range, 0-20 years) admitted with MIS-C between April 22 and May 21, 2020, were  retrospectively reviewed. Thoracic imaging studies were evaluated for  parenchymal, mediastinal and hilar, and cardiovascular abnormalities. Abdominal  imaging studies were evaluated for abnormalities of solid viscera, hollow  viscera, and the peritoneum as well as the mesentery and retroperitoneum.  Studies were reviewed independently by two radiologists, and disagreements were  resolved by a third senior radiologist. RESULTS. Sixteen patients (10 male and  six female patients; age range, 20 months-20 years) were included in this study.  All 16 patients presented with fever. Other presenting signs and symptoms  included the following: vomiting (12/16, 75%), abdominal pain (11/16, 69%), rash  (10/16, 63%), conjunctivitis (8/16, 50%), diarrhea (7/16, 44%), headache (6/16,  38%), and sore throat (5/16, 31%). Shortness of breath and cough were each  present in one patient. Chest radiography showed cardiomegaly (10/16, 63%),  congestive heart failure or cardiogenic pulmonary edema (9/16, 56%), atelectasis  (9/16, 56%), pleural effusions (7/16, 44%), acute respiratory distress syndrome  (2/16, 13%), and pneumonia (1/16, 6%). Eight patients (50%) were evaluated for  pulmonary embolism (PE) (six [75%] by CT angiography [CTA] and two [25%] by  ventilation-perfusion scintigraphy). In two of the eight patients (25%), CTA  showed a segmental PE. Abdominal imaging findings (ultrasound, CT, and  radiography) included small-volume ascites (6/16, 38%), hepatomegaly (6/16,  38%), echogenic kidneys (5/16, 31%), bowel wall thickening (3/16, 19%),  gallbladder wall thickening (3/16, 19%), mesenteric lymphadenopathy (2/16, 13%),  splenomegaly (1/16, 6%), and bladder wall thickening (1/16, 6%). The frequencies  of findings based on all the reviewed modalities were as follows: cardiomegaly  (12/16, 75%), pleural effusion (10/16, 63%), and atelectasis (10/16, 63%).  Absolute interobserver agreement was 0.69-1 for thoracic findings and 0.17-1 for  abdominal findings. Fifteen patients (94%) were discharged from the hospital  (length of hospital stay: range, 3-20 days), and one patient remained in the  hospital at the end of the study period. There were no mortalities. CONCLUSION.  MIS-C associated with COVID-19 is characterized predominantly by cardiovascular  abnormalities, although solid visceral organ, gallbladder, and bowel  abnormalities as well as ascites are also seen, reflecting a multisystemic  inflammatory process. CLINICAL IMPACT. The constellation of imaging findings in  the setting of COVID-19 may alert radiologists to the diagnosis of MIS-C before  rapid deterioration of patients.']","Multisystem inflammatory syndrome in children (MIS-C) is a well described and documented condition that is associated with the active or recent COVID-19 infection. A similar presentation in adults is termed as Multisystem inflammatory syndrome in Adults (MIS-A). Multisystem inflammatory syndrome in children (MIS-C) is a novel, life-threatening hyperinflammatory condition that develops in children a few weeks after infection with severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus-2 (SARS-CoV-2). This disease has created a diagnostic challenge due to overlap with Kawasaki disease (KD) and KD shock syndrome. The majority of patients with MIS-C present with the involvement of at least four organ systems, and all have evidence of a marked inflammatory state. Most patients show an increase in the level of at least four inflammatory markers (C-reactive protein, neutrophil count, ferritin, procalcitonin, fibrinogen, interleukin-6, and triglycerides). Therapy is primarily with immunomodulators, suggesting that the disease is driven by post-infectious immune dysregulation. Most patients, even those with severe cardiovascular involvement, recover without sequelae. Since coronary aneurysms have been reported, echocardiographic follow-up is needed."
15,Which are the enzymes involved in the control of tubulin acetylation?,"['Neuronal migration is a fundamental process during the development of the  cerebral cortex and is regulated by cytoskeletal components. Microtubule  dynamics can be modulated by posttranslational modifications to tubulin  subunits. Acetylation of α-tubulin at lysine 40 is important in regulating  microtubule properties, and this process is controlled by acetyltransferase and  deacetylase. MEC-17 is a newly discovered α-tubulin acetyltransferase that has  been found to play a major role in the acetylation of α-tubulin in different  species in vivo. However, the physiological function of MEC-17 during neural  development is largely unknown. Here, we report that MEC-17 is critical for the  migration of cortical neurons in the rat. MEC-17 was strongly expressed in the  cerebral cortex during development. MEC-17 deficiency caused migratory defects  in the cortical projection neurons and interneurons, and perturbed the  transition of projection neurons from the multipolar stage to the  unipolar/bipolar stage in the intermediate zone of the cortex. Furthermore,  knockdown of α-tubulin deacetylase HDAC6 or overexpression of tubulin(K40Q) to  mimic acetylated α-tubulin could reduce the migratory and morphological defects  caused by MEC-17 deficiency in cortical projection neurons. Thus, MEC-17, which  regulates the acetylation of α-tubulin, appears to control the migration and  morphological transition of cortical neurons. This finding reveals the  importance of MEC-17 and α-tubulin acetylation in cortical development.', 'The human HDAC (histone deacetylase) family, a well-validated anticancer target,  plays a key role in the control of gene expression through regulation of  transcription. While HDACs can be subdivided into three main classes, the class  I, class II and class III HDACs (sirtuins), it is presently unclear whether  inhibiting multiple HDACs using pan-HDAC inhibitors, or targeting specific  isoforms that show aberrant levels in tumours, will prove more effective as an  anticancer strategy in the clinic. To address the above issues, we have tested a  number of clinically relevant HDACis (HDAC inhibitors) against a panel of rhHDAC  (recombinant human HDAC) isoforms. Eight rhHDACs were expressed using a  baculoviral system, and a Fluor de Lystrade mark (Biomol International) HDAC  assay was optimized for each purified isoform. The potency and selectivity of  ten HDACs on class I isoforms (rhHDAC1, rhHDAC2, rhHDAC3 and rhHDAC8) and class  II HDAC isoforms (rhHDAC4, rhHDAC6, rhHDAC7 and rhHDAC9) was determined. MS-275  was HDAC1-selective, MGCD0103 was HDAC1- and HDAC2-selective, apicidin was  HDAC2- and HDAC3-selective and valproic acid was a specific inhibitor of class I  HDACs. The hydroxamic acid-derived compounds (trichostatin A, NVP-LAQ824,  panobinostat, ITF2357, vorinostat and belinostat) were potent pan-HDAC  inhibitors. The growth-inhibitory effect of the HDACis on HeLa cells showed that  both pan-HDAC and class-I-specific inhibitors inhibited cell growth. The results  also showed that both pan-HDAC and class-I-specific inhibitor treatment resulted  in increased acetylation of histones, but only pan-HDAC inhibitor treatment  resulted in increased tubulin acetylation, which is in agreement with their  activity towards the HDAC6 isoform.', ""BACKGROUND: Tubulin is a major substrate of the cytoplasmic class II histone  deacetylase HDAC6. Inhibition of HDAC6 results in higher levels of acetylated  tubulin and enhanced binding of the motor protein kinesin-1 to tubulin, which  promotes transport of cargoes along microtubules. Microtubule-dependent  intracellular trafficking may therefore be regulated by modulating the activity  of HDAC6. We have shown previously that the neuromodulator serotonin increases  mitochondrial movement in hippocampal neurons via the Akt-GSK3beta signaling  pathway. Here, we demonstrate a role for HDAC6 in this signaling pathway. METHODOLOGY/PRINCIPAL FINDINGS: We found that the presence of tubacin, a  specific HDAC6 inhibitor, dramatically enhanced mitochondrial movement in  hippocampal neurons, whereas niltubacin, an inactive tubacin analog, had no  effect. Compared to control cultures, higher levels of acetylated tubulin were  found in neurons treated with tubacin, and more kinesin-1 was associated with  mitochondria isolated from these neurons. Inhibition of GSK3beta decreased  cytoplasmic deacetylase activity and increased tubulin acetylation, whereas  blockade of Akt, which phosphorylates and down-regulates GSK3beta, increased  cytoplasmic deacetylase activity and decreased tubulin acetylation.  Concordantly, the administration of 5-HT, 8-OH-DPAT (a specific 5-HT1A receptor  agonist), or fluoxetine (a 5-HT reuptake inhibitor) increased tubulin  acetylation. GSK3beta was found to co-localize with HDAC6 in hippocampal  neurons, and inhibition of GSK3beta resulted in decreased binding of antibody to  phosphoserine-22, a potential GSK3beta phosphorylation site in HDAC6. GSK3beta  may therefore regulate HDAC6 activity by phosphorylation. CONCLUSIONS/SIGNIFICANCE: This study demonstrates that HDAC6 plays an important  role in the modulation of mitochondrial transport. The link between HDAC6 and  GSK3beta, established here, has important implications for our understanding of  neurodegenerative disorders. In particular, abnormal mitochondrial transport,  which has been observed in such disorders as Alzheimer's disease and Parkinson's  disease, could result from the misregulation of HDAC6 by GSK3beta. HDAC6 may  therefore constitute an attractive target in the treatment of these disorders."", 'Neurotensin (NT), an intestinal peptide secreted from N cells in the small  bowel, regulates a variety of physiological functions of the gastrointestinal  tract, including secretion, gut motility, and intestinal growth. The class IA  phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase (PI3K) family, which comprised of p110 catalytic  (α, β and δ) and p85 regulatory subunits, has been implicated in the regulation  of hormone secretion from endocrine cells. However, the underlying mechanisms  remain poorly understood. In particular, the role of PI3K in intestinal peptide  secretion is not known. Here, we show that PI3K catalytic subunit, p110α,  negatively regulates NT secretion in vitro and in vivo. We demonstrate that  inhibition of p110α, but not p110β, induces NT release in BON, a human endocrine  cell line, which expresses NT mRNA and produces NT peptide in a manner analogous  to N cells, and QGP-1, a pancreatic endocrine cell line that produces NT  peptide. In contrast, overexpression of p110α decreases NT secretion.  Consistently, p110α-inhibition increases plasma NT levels in mice. To further  delineate the mechanisms contributing to this effect, we demonstrate that  inhibition of p110α increases NT granule trafficking by up-regulating α-tubulin  acetylation; NT secretion is prevented by overexpression of HDAC6, an α-tubulin  deacetylase. Moreover, ras-related protein Rab27A (a small G protein) and kinase  D-interacting substrate of 220 kDa (Kidins220), which are associated with NT  granules, play a negative and positive role, respectively, in  p110α-inhibition-induced NT secretion. Our findings identify the critical role  and novel mechanisms for the PI3K signaling pathway in the control of intestinal  hormone granule transport and release.', 'Cytoskeleton remodelling is a prerequisite step for the morphological transition  from preadipocytes to mature adipocytes. Although microtubules play a pivotal  role in organizing cellular structure, regulation of microtubule dynamics during  adipogenesis remains unclear. In the present paper we show that acetylation of  α-tubulin is up-regulated during adipogenesis, and adipocyte development is  dependent on α-tubulin acetylation, as expression of an acetylation-resistant  α-tubulin mutant significantly inhibits adipogenesis. Moreover, acetylation of  α-tubulin is under the control of the acetyltransferase MEC-17 and deacetylases  SIRT2 (Sirtuin 2) and HDAC6 (histone deacetylase 6). Adipocyte development is  inhibited in MEC-17-knockdown cells, but enhanced in MEC-17-overexpressing  cells. Finally, we show that katanin, a microtubule-severing protein with  enhanced activity on acetylated α-tubulin, is actively involved in adipogenesis.  We propose that co-ordinated up-regulation of α-tubulin acetylation initiates  cytoskeleton remodelling by promoting α-tubulin severing by katanin which, in  turn, allows expansion of lipid droplets and accelerates the morphological  transition toward mature adipocytes.', 'TPPP/p25 (tubulin polymerization-promoting protein/p25) is an unstructured  protein that induces microtubule polymerization in vitro and is aligned along  the microtubule network in transfected mammalian cells. In normal human brain,  TPPP/p25 is expressed predominantly in oligodendrocytes, where its expression is  proved to be crucial for their differentiation process. Here we demonstrated  that the expression of TPPP/p25 in HeLa cells, in doxycycline-inducible CHO10  cells, and in the oligodendrocyte CG-4 cells promoted the acetylation of  alpha-tubulin at residue Lys-40, whereas its down-regulation by specific small  interfering RNA in CG-4 cells or by the withdrawal of doxycycline from CHO10  cells decreased the acetylation level of alpha-tubulin. Our results indicate  that TPPP/p25 binds to HDAC6 (histone deacetylase 6), an enzyme responsible for  tubulin deacetylation. Moreover, we demonstrated that the direct interaction of  these two proteins resulted in the inhibition of the deacetylase activity of  HDAC6. The measurement of HDAC6 activity showed that TPPP/p25 is able to induce  almost complete (90%) inhibition at 3 microM concentration. In addition,  treatment of the cells with nocodazole, vinblastine, or cold exposure revealed  that microtubule acetylation induced by trichostatin A, a well known HDAC6  inhibitor, does not cause microtubule stabilization. In contrast, the  microtubule bundling activity of TPPP/p25 was able to protect the microtubules  from depolymerization. Finally, we demonstrated that, similarly to other HDAC6  inhibitors, TPPP/p25 influences the microtubule dynamics by decreasing the  growth velocity of the microtubule plus ends and also affects cell motility as  demonstrated by time lapse video experiments. Thus, we suggest that TPPP/p25 is  a multiple effector of the microtubule organization.', 'Glutamylation, the most prevalent tubulin posttranslational modification, marks  stable microtubules and regulates recruitment and activity of microtubule-  interacting proteins. Nine enzymes of the tubulin tyrosine ligase-like (TTLL)  family catalyze glutamylation. TTLL7, the most abundant neuronal glutamylase,  adds glutamates preferentially to the β-tubulin tail. Coupled with ensemble and  single-molecule biochemistry, our hybrid X-ray and cryo-electron microscopy  structure of TTLL7 bound to the microtubule delineates a tripartite microtubule  recognition strategy. The enzyme uses its core to engage the disordered anionic  tails of α- and β-tubulin, and a flexible cationic domain to bind the  microtubule and position itself for β-tail modification. Furthermore, we  demonstrate that all single-chain TTLLs with known glutamylase activity utilize  a cationic microtubule-binding domain analogous to that of TTLL7. Therefore, our  work reveals the combined use of folded and intrinsically disordered substrate  recognition elements as the molecular basis for specificity among the enzymes  primarily responsible for chemically diversifying cellular microtubules.', ""Mdm2 is a RING finger E3 ubiquitin ligase, which promotes ubiquitination and  proteasomal degradation of the p53 tumor suppressor protein. Acetylation of p53  regulates p53's transcriptional activity and inhibits Mdm2-mediated p53  ubiquitination and degradation. We now report that Mdm2 is also a target for  acetylation. Mdm2 is acetylated in vitro by CREB-binding protein (CBP) and to a  lesser extent by p300, but not by p300/CPB-associated factor. Acetylation occurs  primarily within the RING finger domain of Mdm2. In vivo acetylation of Mdm2 was  detected easily with CBP but not p300. Efficient in vivo acetylation required  the preservation of the RING finger. An Mdm2 mutant (K466/467Q) mimicking  acetylation is impaired in its ability to promote p53 ubiquitination, as well as  Mdm2 autoubiquitination. Moreover, K466/467Q is defective in promoting p53  degradation in living cells. We thus suggest that acetyltransferases may  modulate cellular p53 activity not only by modifying p53, but also by  inactivating Mdm2."", 'In most eukaryotic cells, tubulin is subjected to posttranslational  glutamylation, a conserved modification of unclear function. The glutamyl side  chains form as branches of the primary sequence glutamic acids in two  biochemically distinct steps: initiation and elongation. The length of the  glutamyl side chain is spatially controlled and microtubule type specific. Here,  we probe the significance of the glutamyl side chain length regulation in vivo  by overexpressing a potent side chain elongase enzyme, Ttll6Ap, in Tetrahymena.  Overexpression of Ttll6Ap caused hyperelongation of glutamyl side chains on the  tubulin of axonemal, cortical, and cytoplasmic microtubules. Strikingly, in the  same cell, hyperelongation of glutamyl side chains stabilized cytoplasmic  microtubules and destabilized axonemal microtubules. Our observations suggest  that the cellular outcomes of glutamylation are mediated by spatially restricted  tubulin interactors of diverse nature.', 'The 70kDa ribosomal protein S6 kinases (S6K1 and S6K2) play important roles in  the regulation of protein synthesis, cell growth and survival. S6Ks are  activated in response to mitogen stimulation and nutrient sufficiency by the  phosphorylation of conserved serine and threonine residues. Here we show for the  first time, that in addition to phosphorylation, S6Ks are also targeted by  lysine acetylation. Following mitogen stimulation, S6Ks interact with the p300  and p300/CBP-associated factor (PCAF) acetyltransferases. S6Ks can be acetylated  by p300 and PCAF in vitro and S6K acetylation is detected in cells expressing  p300. Furthermore, it appears that the acetylation sites targeted by p300 lie  within the divergent C-terminal regulatory domains of both S6K1 and S6K2.  Acetylation of S6K1 and 2 is increased upon the inhibition of class I/II histone  deacetylases (HDACs) by trichostatin-A, while the enhancement of S6K1  acetylation by nicotinamide suggests the additional involvement of sirtuin  deacetylases in S6K deacetylation. Both expression of p300 and HDAC inhibition  cause increases in S6K protein levels, and we have shown that S6K2 is stabilized  in cells treated with HDAC inhibitors. The finding that S6Ks are targeted by  histone acetyltransferases uncovers a novel mode of crosstalk between mitogenic  signalling pathways and the transcriptional machinery and reveals additional  complexity in the regulation of S6K function.']","Acetyltransferase MEC-17, and deacetylases SIRT2 (Sirtuin 2), HDAC6 (histone deacetylase 6) and dTip60 are known to control the levels of tubulin acetylation."
16,Is Growth factor independence 1b (GFI1B) important for hematopoiesis?,"['The family of Gfi-1 zinc finger transcriptional repressor oncoproteins consists  of Gfi-1 and Gfi-1B. Recent gene targeting experiments and mutational screening  in humans have revealed an essential role for Gfi-1 and Gfi-1B in hematopoiesis.  Mice lacking Gfi-1 are unexpectedly neutropenic. Neutrophil differentiation is  abolished and T lymphocyte differentiation is partially blocked in these mice.  Heterozygous germline mutations of Gfi-1 causes severe congenital neutropenia  (SCN) in humans. Ela2, whose germline mutation is the major contributor to  hereditary neutropenias, is repressed in vivo by Gfi-1. Gfi-1B disruption is  embryonic lethal due to a block of erythropoiesis. Gfi-1B is required for both  erythroid and megakaryocyte development. The ongoing identification of repressed  target genes and interacting transcriptional cofactors is helping to unravel the  central contributions of these two hematopoietic factors.', 'Growth factor-independence 1b (Gfi1b) is a zinc finger transcription factor  essential for erythroid and megakaryocytic development. To better understand  Gfi1b regulation and to know the implication of the level of expression of this  gene in human pathology, we have searched for promoter punctual sequence  variations in 214 patients with different hematological diseases. We found two  previously unknown congenital mutations at evolutionary conserved GATA and  octamer-binding (Oct) transcription factor sites. The Oct site mutation was also  found in five relatives of the patient. The GATA motif mutation reduced promoter  activity by 50% in vitro, while homozygous patients with the octamer site  mutation showed a four-to-five times increase of Gfi1b RNA in platelets.  Electrophoretic mobility shift analyses demonstrated that different protein  complexes bind to both sites and that binding is reduced by the mutations.  Finally, we found that GATA-1 and Oct-1 are the main components of each complex.  This study provides evidences of a new mechanism for Gfi1b repression. This is  also the first report of Gfi1b mutations with a functional implication; further  investigation and follow-up will clarify the involvement of these mutations in  hematological disease.', 'Histone deacetylase inhibitors represent a family of targeted anticancer  compounds that are widely used against hematological malignancies. So far little  is known about their effects on normal myelopoiesis. Therefore, in order to  investigate the effect of histone deacetylase inhibitors on the myeloid  commitment of hematopoietic stem/progenitor cells, we treated CD34(+) cells with  valproic acid (VPA). Our results demonstrate that VPA treatment induces H4  histone acetylation and hampers cell cycle progression in CD34(+) cells  sustaining high levels of CD34 protein expression. In addition, our data show  that VPA treatment promotes erythrocyte and megakaryocyte differentiation. In  fact, we demonstrate that VPA treatment is able to induce the expression of  growth factor-independent protein 1B (GFI1B) and of mixed-lineage leukemia  translocated to chromosome 3 protein (MLLT3), which are crucial regulators of  erythrocyte and megakaryocyte differentiation, and that the up-regulation of  these genes is mediated by the histone hyperacetylation at their promoter sites.  Finally, we show that GFI1B inhibition impairs erythroid and megakaryocyte  differentiation induced by VPA, while MLLT3 silencing inhibits megakaryocyte  commitment only. As a whole, our data suggest that VPA sustains the expression  of stemness-related markers in hematopoietic stem/progenitor cells and is able  to interfere with hematopoietic lineage commitment by enhancing erythrocyte and  megakaryocyte differentiation and by inhibiting the granulocyte and  mono-macrophage maturation.', ""The regulation of gene transcription is elementary for the function of  hematopoietic stem cells (HSCs). The transcriptional repressor growth factor  independence 1 (Gfi1) restricts HSC proliferation and is essential to maintain  their self-renewal capacity and multipotency after transplantation. In addition,  Gfi1(-/-) HSCs are severely compromised in their ability to compete with  wild-type (wt) HSCs after transplantation. We now report that Gfi1 protects HSCs  against stress-induced apoptosis, probably, by repressing the proapoptotic  target gene Bax, since irradiated Gfi1(-/-) HSCs display higher expression of  Bax and show a higher rate of apoptosis than wt HSCs. This protective function  of Gfi1 appears to be functionally relevant since Gfi1(-/-) HSCs that express  Bcl-2, which antagonizes the effects of Bax, regain their ability to self renew  and to initiate multilineage differentiation after transplantation.  Surprisingly, Gfi1(-/-) xBcl-2 transgenic mice also show a strong, systemic  expansion of Mac-1(+) Gr-1(-) myeloid cells in bone marrow and peripheral  lymphoid organs. These cells express high levels of the proleukemogenic  transcription factor Hoxa9 and, in older mice, appear as atypical  monocytoid-blastoid cells in the peripheral blood. As a result of this massive  expansion of myeloid cells, all Gfi1(-/-) xBcl-2 mice eventually succumb to a  myeloproliferative-like disease resembling a preleukemic state. In summary, our  data demonstrate that Gfi1's ability to protect against apoptosis is essential  for HSC function. In addition, our finding show that Gfi1 prevents the  development of myeloproliferative diseases and provides evidence how Gfi1  deficiency could be linked to myeloid leukemia."", 'BACKGROUND: In erythroblasts, the CoREST repressor complex is recruited to  target promoters by the transcription factor Gfi1b, leading to repression of  genes mainly involved in erythroid differentiation. Hmg20b is a subunit of  CoREST, but its role in erythropoiesis has not yet been established. DESIGN AND METHODS: To study the role of Hmg20b in erythropoiesis, we performed  knockdown experiments in a differentiation-competent mouse fetal liver cell  line, and in primary mouse fetal liver cells. The effects on globin gene  expression were determined. We used microarrays to investigate global gene  expression changes induced by Hmg20b knockdown. Functional analysis was carried  out on Hrasls3, an Hmg20b target gene. RESULTS: We show that Hmg20b depletion induces spontaneous differentiation. To  identify the target genes of Hmg20b, microarray analysis was performed on Hmg20b  knockdown cells and controls. In line with its association to the CoREST  complex, we found that 85% (527 out of 620) of the deregulated genes are  up-regulated when Hmg20b levels are reduced. Among the few down-regulated genes  was Gfi1b, a known repressor of erythroid differentiation. Among the  consistently up-regulated targets were embryonic β-like globins and the  phospholipase HRAS-like suppressor 3 (Hrasls3). We show that Hrasls3 expression  is induced during erythroid differentiation and that knockdown of Hrasls3  inhibits terminal differentiation of proerythroblasts. CONCLUSIONS: We conclude that Hmg20b acts as an inhibitor of erythroid  differentiation, through the down-regulation of genes involved in  differentiation such as Hrasls3, and activation of repressors of differentiation  such as Gfi1b. In addition, Hmg20b suppresses embryonic β-like globins.', 'The family of Gfi-1 zinc finger transcriptional repressor oncoproteins consists  of Gfi-1 and Gfi-1B.

Both gene  loci are under autoregulatory and cross-regulatory feedback control. We have  generated a reporter mouse strain by inserting the cDNA for green fluorescent  protein (GFP) into the Gfi1b gene locus which allowed us to follow Gfi1b  expression during hematopoiesis and lymphopoiesis by measuring green  fluorescence. We found highly dynamic expression patterns of Gfi1b in erythroid  cells, megakaryocytes, and their progenitor cells (MEPS) where Gfi1 is not  detected. Vice versa, Gfi1b could not be found in granulocytes, activated  macrophages, or their granulomonocytic precursors (GMPs) or in mature naive or  activated lymphocytes where Gfi1 is expressed, suggesting a complementary  regulation of both loci during hematopoiesis. However, Gfi1b was found to be  up-regulated in early stages of B-cell and in a subset of early T-cell  development, where Gfi1 is also present, suggesting that cross-regulation of  both loci exists but is cell-type specific.', 'Recent studies have established that during embryonic development, hematopoietic  progenitors and stem cells are generated from hemogenic endothelium precursors  through a process termed endothelial to hematopoietic transition (EHT). The  transcription factor RUNX1 is essential for this process, but its main  downstream effectors remain largely unknown. Here, we report the identification  of Gfi1 and Gfi1b as direct targets of RUNX1 and critical regulators of EHT.  GFI1 and GFI1B are able to trigger, in the absence of RUNX1, the down-regulation  of endothelial markers and the formation of round cells, a morphologic change  characteristic of EHT. Conversely, blood progenitors in Gfi1- and  Gfi1b-deficient embryos maintain the expression of endothelial genes. Moreover,  those cells are not released from the yolk sac and disseminated into embryonic  tissues. Taken together, our findings demonstrate a critical and specific role  of the GFI1 transcription factors in the first steps of the process leading to  the generation of hematopoietic progenitors from hemogenic endothelium.', 'Gfi-1B is a transcriptional repressor essential for the regulation of  erythropoiesis and megakaryopoiesis. Here we identify Gfi-1B p32, a Gfi-1B  isoform, as essential for erythroid differentiation. Gfi-1B p32 is generated by  alternative splicing and lacks the two first zinc finger domains of the protein.  Selective knock down of Gfi-1B p32 compromises erythroid differentiation,  whereas its ectopic expression induces erythropoiesis in the absence of  erythropoietin. Gfi-1B p32 isoform binds to Gfi-1B target gene promoters and  associates with the LSD1-CoREST repressor complex more efficiently than the  major Gfi-1B p37 isoform. Furthermore, we show that Gfi-1B includes a KSKK motif  in its SNAG domain, which recruits the repressor complex only when dimethylated  on lysine 8. Mutation of lysine 8 prevents Gfi-1B p32-induced erythroid  development. Our results thus highlight a key role for the alternatively spliced  Gfi-1B p32 isoform in erythroid development.', 'Gfi1 is a transcriptional repressor essential for haematopoiesis and inner ear  development. It shares with its paralogue Gfi1b an amino-terminal SNAG repressor  domain and six carboxy-terminal zinc-finger motifs, but differs from Gfi1b in  sequences separating these domains. Here, we describe two knock-in mouse models,  in which the N-terminal SNAG repressor domain was mutated or in which the Gfi1  coding region was replaced by Gfi1b. Mouse mutants without an intact SNAG domain  show the full phenotype of Gfi1 null mice. However, Gfi1:Gfi1b knock-in mice  show almost normal pre-T-cell and neutrophil development, but lack properly  formed inner ear hair cells. Hence, our findings show that an intact SNAG domain  is essential for all functions of Gfi1 and that Gfi1b can replace Gfi1  functionally in haematopoiesis but, surprisingly, not in inner ear hair cell  development, demonstrating that Gfi1 and Gfi1b have equivalent and  domain-dependent, cell type-specific functions.']",Yes. Gfi-1B is a transcriptional repressor essential for the regulation of erythropoiesis and megakaryopoiesis.  Gfi-1b(-/-) embryonic stem cells fail to contribute to red cells of adult chimeras. Gfi-1b(-/-) embryos exhibit delayed maturation of primitive erythrocytes and subsequently die with failure to produce definitive enucleated erythrocytes.
17,What is measured through the NOMe-Seq methodology?,"[""5-Aza-2'-deoxycytidine, approved by the FDA for the treatment of myelodysplastic  syndrome (MDS), is incorporated into the DNA of dividing cells where it  specifically inhibits DNA methylation by forming covalent complexes with the DNA  methyltransferases (DNMTs). In an effort to study the correlations between DNA  methylation, nucleosome remodeling, and gene reactivation, we investigate the  integrated epigenetic events that worked coordinately to reprogram the  methylated and closed promoters back to permissive chromatin configurations  after 5-Aza-2'-deoxycytidine treatment. The ChIP results indicate that H2A.Z is  deposited at promoter regions by the Snf2-related CBP activator protein (SRCAP)  complex following DNA demethylation. According to our genome-wide expression and  DNA methylation profiles, we find that the complete re-activation of silenced  genes requires the insertion of the histone variant H2A.Z, which facilitates the  acquisition of regions fully depleted of nucleosome as demonstrated by NOMe-seq  (Nucleosome Occupancy Methylome-sequencing) assay. In contrast, SRCAP-mediated  H2A.Z deposition is not required for maintaining the active status of  constitutively expressed genes. By combining Hpa II digestion with NOMe-seq  assay, we show that hemimethylated DNA, which is generated following drug  incorporation, remains occupied by nucleosomes. Our data highlight H2A.Z as a  novel and essential factor involved in 5-Aza-2'-deoxycytidine-induced gene  reactivation. Furthermore, we elucidate that chromatin remodeling translates the  demethylation ability of DNMT inhibitors to their downstream efficacies,  suggesting future therapeutic implications for chromatin remodelers."", 'BACKGROUND: Splicing is more efficient when coupled with transcription and it  has been proposed that nucleosomes enriched in exons are important for splice  site recognition. Lynch syndrome is a familial cancer syndrome that can be  caused by the autosomal dominant inheritance of splice site mutations in the  MutL homolog 1 (MLH1) gene. To better understand the role of nucleosomes in  splicing, we used MLH1 splice site mutations in Lynch syndrome cases as a model  to investigate if abnormal splicing was associated with altered nucleosome  positioning at exon-intron boundaries. FINDINGS: Nucleosome Occupancy and Methylome sequencing (NOMe-seq) was used to  determine the allele-specific positioning of nucleosomes around heterozygous  splice site mutations in lymphoblastoid cells lines (LCLs) derived from six  Lynch syndrome patients. These mutations were previously shown to cause exon  skipping in five of the six patients. Allele-specific high-resolution nucleosome  mapping across exons and exon-intron boundaries revealed high levels of  nucleosomes across all regions examined. Alleles containing donor or acceptor  splice site mutations showed no consistent alteration in nucleosome positioning  or occupancy. CONCLUSION: Nucleosomes were enriched at MLH1 exons in LCLs derived from Lynch  syndrome patients, and in this model system the positioning of nucleosomes was  unaltered at exon-intron boundaries containing splice site mutations. Thus,  these splice site mutations alone do not significantly change the local  organisation of nucleosomes.', 'The study of epigenetic heterogeneity at the level of individual cells and in  whole populations is the key to understanding cellular differentiation,  organismal development, and the evolution of cancer. We develop a statistical  method, epiG, to infer and differentiate between different epi-allelic  haplotypes, annotated with CpG methylation status and DNA polymorphisms, from  whole-genome bisulfite sequencing data, and nucleosome occupancy from NOMe-seq  data. We demonstrate the capabilities of the method by inferring allele-specific  methylation and nucleosome occupancy in cell lines, and colon and tumor samples,  and by benchmarking the method against independent experimental data.', 'The binding and contribution of transcription factors (TF) to cell specific gene  expression is often deduced from open-chromatin measurements to avoid costly TF  ChIP-seq assays. Thus, it is important to develop computational methods for  accurate TF binding prediction in open-chromatin regions (OCRs). Here, we report  a novel segmentation-based method, TEPIC, to predict TF binding by combining  sets of OCRs with position weight matrices. TEPIC can be applied to various  open-chromatin data, e.g. DNaseI-seq and NOMe-seq. Additionally, Histone-Marks  (HMs) can be used to identify candidate TF binding sites. TEPIC computes TF  affinities and uses open-chromatin/HM signal intensity as quantitative measures  of TF binding strength. Using machine learning, we find low affinity binding  sites to improve our ability to explain gene expression variability compared to  the standard presence/absence classification of binding sites. Further, we show  that both footprints and peaks capture essential TF binding events and lead to a  good prediction performance. In our application, gene-based scores computed by  TEPIC with one open-chromatin assay nearly reach the quality of several TF  ChIP-seq data sets. Finally, these scores correctly predict known  transcriptional regulators as illustrated by the application to novel DNaseI-seq  and NOMe-seq data for primary human hepatocytes and CD4+ T-cells, respectively.', 'BACKGROUND: DNA methylation is an epigenetic modification that is enriched in  heterochromatin but depleted at active promoters and enhancers. However, the  debate on whether or not DNA methylation is a reliable indicator of high  nucleosome occupancy has not been settled. For example, the methylation levels  of DNA flanking CTCF sites are higher in linker DNA than in nucleosomal DNA,  while other studies have shown that the nucleosome core is the preferred site of  methylation. In this study, we make progress toward understanding these  conflicting phenomena by implementing a bioinformatics approach that combines  MNase-seq and NOMe-seq data and by comprehensively profiling DNA methylation and  nucleosome occupancy throughout the human genome. RESULTS: The results demonstrated that increasing methylated CpG density is  correlated with nucleosome occupancy in the total genome and within nearly all  subgenomic regions. Features with elevated methylated CpG density such as exons,  SINE-Alu sequences, H3K36-trimethylated peaks, and methylated CpG islands are  among the highest nucleosome occupied elements in the genome, while some of the  lowest occupancies are displayed by unmethylated CpG islands and unmethylated  transcription factor binding sites. Additionally, outside of CpG islands, the  density of CpGs within nucleosomes was shown to be important for the nucleosomal  location of DNA methylation with low CpG frequencies favoring linker methylation  and high CpG frequencies favoring core particle methylation. Prominent  exceptions to the correlations between methylated CpG density and nucleosome  occupancy include CpG islands marked by H3K27me3 and CpG-poor heterochromatin  marked by H3K9me3, and these modifications, along with DNA methylation,  distinguish the major silencing mechanisms of the human epigenome. CONCLUSIONS: Thus, the relationship between DNA methylation and nucleosome  occupancy is influenced by the density of methylated CpG dinucleotides and by  other epigenomic components in chromatin.', 'Transcriptome sequencing allows for analysis of mature RNAs at base pair  resolution. Here we show that RNA-seq can also be used for studying nascent RNAs  undergoing transcription. We sequenced total RNA from human brain and liver and  found a large fraction of reads (up to 40%) within introns. Intronic RNAs were  abundant in brain tissue, particularly for genes involved in axonal growth and  synaptic transmission. Moreover, we detected significant differences in intronic  RNA levels between fetal and adult brains. We show that the pattern of intronic  sequence read coverage is explained by nascent transcription in combination with  co-transcriptional splicing. Further analysis of co-transcriptional splicing  indicates a correlation between slowly removed introns and alternative splicing.  Our data show that sequencing of total RNA provides unique insight into the  transcriptional processes in the cell, with particular importance for normal  brain development.', 'MOTIVATION: Allele-specific expression (ASE) refers to the differential  abundance of the allelic copies of a transcript. RNA sequencing (RNA-seq) can  provide quantitative estimates of ASE for genes with transcribed polymorphisms.  When short-read sequences are aligned to a diploid transcriptome, read-mapping  ambiguities confound our ability to directly count reads. Multi-mapping reads  aligning equally well to multiple genomic locations, isoforms or alleles can  comprise the majority (>85%) of reads. Discarding them can result in biases and  substantial loss of information. Methods have been developed that use weighted  allocation of read counts but these methods treat the different types of  multi-reads equivalently. We propose a hierarchical approach to allocation of  read counts that first resolves ambiguities among genes, then among isoforms,  and lastly between alleles. We have implemented our model in EMASE software  (Expectation-Maximization for Allele Specific Expression) to estimate total gene  expression, isoform usage and ASE based on this hierarchical allocation. RESULTS: Methods that align RNA-seq reads to a diploid transcriptome  incorporating known genetic variants improve estimates of ASE and total gene  expression compared to methods that use reference genome alignments. Weighted  allocation methods outperform methods that discard multi-reads. Hierarchical  allocation of reads improves estimation of ASE even when data are simulated from  a non-hierarchical model. Analysis of RNA-seq data from F1 hybrid mice using  EMASE reveals widespread ASE associated with cis-acting polymorphisms and a  small number of parent-of-origin effects.

This package implements algorithms for  pre-processing, quality-control, normalization and copy number variation  detection. A series of reporting and data visualization methods support  exploratory analyses. To demonstrate its utility, we apply it to a new dataset  of 96 genes profiled on 41 prostate tumour and 24 matched normal samples.

SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: Supplementary data are available at Bioinformatics  online.', 'Transcript quantification is a long-standing problem in genomics and estimating  the relative abundance of alternatively-spliced isoforms from the same  transcript is an important special case. Both problems have recently been  illuminated by high-throughput RNA sequencing experiments which are quickly  generating large amounts of data. However, much of the signal present in this  data is corrupted or obscured by biases resulting in non-uniform and  non-proportional representation of sequences from different transcripts. Many  existing analyses attempt to deal with these and other biases with various  task-specific approaches, which makes direct comparison between them difficult.  However, two popular tools for isoform quantification, MISO and Cufflinks, have  adopted a general probabilistic framework to model and mitigate these biases in  a more general fashion. These advances motivate the need to investigate the  effects of RNA-seq biases on the accuracy of different approaches for isoform  quantification. We conduct the investigation by building models of increasing  sophistication to account for noise introduced by the biases and compare their  accuracy to the established approaches. We focus on methods that estimate the  expression of alternatively-spliced isoforms with the percent-spliced-in (PSI)  metric for each exon skipping event. To improve their estimates, many methods  use evidence from RNA-seq reads that align to exon bodies. However, the methods  we propose focus on reads that span only exon-exon junctions. As a result, our  approaches are simpler and less sensitive to exon definitions than existing  methods, which enables us to distinguish their strengths and weaknesses more  easily. We present several probabilistic models of of position-specific read  counts with increasing complexity and compare them to each other and to the  current state-of-the-art methods in isoform quantification, MISO and Cufflinks.  On a validation set with RT-PCR measurements for 26 cassette events, some of our  methods are more accurate and some are significantly more consistent than these  two popular tools. This comparison demonstrates the challenges in estimating the  percent inclusion of alternatively spliced junctions and illuminates the  tradeoffs between different approaches.']",We have developed a method (NOMe-seq) that uses a GpC methyltransferase (M.CviPI) and next generation sequencing to generate a high resolution footprint of nucleosome positioning genome-wide using less than 1 million cells while retaining endogenous DNA methylation information from the same DNA strand.

18,What is known about the Digit Ratio (2D:4D) cancer?,"[""The androgen receptor gene (AR) contains a domain which includes a variable  number of CAG sequences and alleles with low numbers of CAG repeats show high  transactivation activity when complexed with testosterone. The ratio of 2nd and  4th digit length (2D:4D) is negatively correlated with phenotypic effects of  testosterone. Low numbers of CAG repeats and low 2D:4D are both associated with  high sperm numbers and protection against breast cancer. This suggests that CAG  number and 2D:4D are correlated i.e. low CAG number and low 2D:4D indicate high  activation of androgen-responsive genes. Findings from AR studies predict that  low 2D:4D will be associated with prostate and hepatocellular cancer,  urolithiasis, ADHD, ankylosing spondylitis, spontaneous abortion, and polycystic  ovaries, while high 2D:4D will be associated with motor neuron diseases and  endometrial cancer. Findings from 2D:4D studies predict that short CAG length  will be common in autism and Asperger's syndrome, while high numbers of CAG  repeats will be found in men who are prone to early myocardial infarction."", 'OBJECTIVE: To investigate the relationships between 2nd to 4th digit ratio  (digit ratio) and prostate cancer detection rate and biopsy findings, including  Gleason score. MATERIALS AND METHODS: In 770 consecutive men aged 40 years or older that  presented with lower urinary tract symptoms (LUTS), right hand 2nd and 4th digit  lengths were measured prior to PSA determinations, DRE and transrectal  ultrasonography (TRUS). Among these, 166 men with a prostate specific antigen  (PSA) level ≥ 3 ng/mL or abnormal digit rectal examination (DRE) prospectively  underwent prostate biopsies. The relationship between digit ratio and prostate  cancer detection rate and biopsy findings was investigated. RESULTS: The study subjects were allocated to two groups by digit ratio (group  A: digit ratio < 0.95; n = 420; group B: digit ratio ≥ 0.95; n = 350). Despite  similar biopsy rates (22.4% vs. 20.6%, p = 0.544), group A had higher cancer  detection rate (46.8% (44/94) vs. 23.6% (17/72), p = 0.002; OR = 2.847, 95% CI =  1.445-5.610). When we analyzed 408 positive biopsy cores (group A: digit ratio <  0.95, n = 282; group B: digit ratio ≥ 0.95, n = 126), group A had higher  percentage of core cancer volume (46.7% vs. 37.1%, p = 0.005) and more biopsy  cores with high Gleason score (sum of Gleason score ≥ 9: 18/282 (6.4%) vs. 1/126  (0.8%), p = 0.010; primary Gleason score = 5: 12/282 (4.3%) vs. 0/126 (0.0%), p  = 0.021). CONCLUSIONS: A lower digit ratio is related to an increased detection rate of  prostate cancer, a high percentage of core cancer volume and a high Gleason  score.', 'BACKGROUND: The ratio of digit lengths is fixed in utero, and may be a proxy  indicator for prenatal testosterone levels.

Risk reduction was  even greater (87%) in age group <60 (OR 0.13, 95% CI 0.09-0.21). CONCLUSION: Pattern of finger lengths may be a simple marker of prostate cancer  risk, with length of 2D greater than 4D suggestive of lower risk.', 'OBJECTIVES: Digit ratio, especially second-to-fourth digit ratio (2D:4D) is  established in utero and is positively correlated with oestrogen in men and  women. It is a putative biomarker for prenatal hormone exposure and may  represent an individual predisposition to certain diseases (e.g., breast  cancer). The aim of the present study is to investigate whether there is a link  between digit ratio (2D:4D) and breast cancer in Chinese populations. METHODS: The controls we chose were healthy subjects-age and -sex matched to the  patients diagnosed with breast cancer. Photocopies of the two hands of 218 women  (controls: 109; patients: 109) were collected. Left hand, right hand, mean hand,  and right minus left 2D:4D (Dr-l ) were analyzed. RESULTS: The patients with breast cancer presented significantly higher 2D:4D  than controls (left: P < 0.01; right: P < 0.05; mean: P < 0.05). The mean values  of 2D:4D on the left hand were significantly higher than those on the right hand  in the two groups, respectively (controls: P < 0.05; patients: P ≤ 0.01). In  patients, there was a significantly negative correlation between 2D:4D (left  hand: P < 0.01; right hand, mean: P < 0.05) and the presented age with breast  cancer, but no association between Dr-l and age of presented disease.

METHODS: We prospectively recruited 204 consecutive patients referred for  transrectal prostate biopsy due to PSA elevation or abnormal digital rectal  examination between January 2008 and June 2009. The same physician performed all  clinical examinations, digit ratio measurements and transrectal biopsy in all  cases. Digit ratio determination was done with a Vernier caliper in the left  hand. Patients underwent determination of hormone profile (testosterone and  sexual hormone binding globulin (SHBG)) between 7:00AM and 11:00AM. Age, digital  rectal examination, PSA, free PSA, PSA density, testosterone and SHBG,  pathological report and D2 and D4 measurements were recorded prospectively.

No differences in PCa were seen  regarding PSA, free PSA, PSA density, digital rectal examination and  testosterone. CONCLUSION: High digit ratio predicts PCa in men undergoing prostate biopsy.

Participants included 480 youth handball players (240  females and 240 males) being considered as part of the talent selection  programme for the German Youth National team. Hand dominance and digit ratio  were compared to age-matched control data using standard t-tests. There was a  greater proportion of left-handers compared to the normal population in males  but not in females. There was also a lower digit ratio in both females and  males. However, there were no differences between those selected for the next  stage of talent development and those not selected on either handedness or digit  ratio. These results add support for general effects for both digit ratio and  handedness in elite handball; however, these factors seem inadequate to explain  talent selection decisions at this level."", 'Second-to-fourth digit ratio (2D:4D), a widely studied putative marker for  masculinization through prenatal androgen exposure, is lower (more masculinized)  in athletes than in general population controls, and athletes with lower 2D:4D  have higher sporting success. Occupations differ markedly in perceived  masculinity and actual maleness (sex ratios), but these givens have not yet been  picked up and utilized in 2D:4D research. Accordingly, this study extended  existing accounts on 2D:4D in athletes to a novel approach: 2D:4D and possible  relationships to a variety of candidate variables (demographic,  fertility-related, psychological, and other) were investigated in firefighters,  a highly male-dominated occupation. Contrary to expectation, 2D:4D in  firefighters (N = 134) was not lower than in local male population controls.  Lower 2D:4D corresponded to lower service ranks. Replicating previous findings  either unequivocally or partly, lower 2D:4D was associated with larger family  size, later sibling position, left-handedness, and higher scores in the  disinhibition component of sensation seeking. Not replicating prior evidence,  2D:4D was unrelated to body-mass index, offspring sex ratio, and sporting  performance level. Novel findings included low 2D:4D in those with low  relationship satisfaction and in cigarette smokers, especially among heavy  smokers. Absolute finger length, a positive correlate of pubertal-adolescent  androgen levels, was also considered. This marker showed negative associations  with relationship consensus and satisfaction and positive ones with perceived  quality of relationship alternatives and the experience seeking component of  sensation seeking. The merits of this additional marker, relative to 2D:4D, for  supplementing studies of possible sex-hormonal effects on personality and  directions for future inquiry along these lines are discussed.', 'Our objective was to propose a testable hypothesis arising from the recent  finding of a low index-to-ring finger ratio (2D:4D ratio) in ALS. The 2D:4D  ratio finding suggests that prenatal testosterone exposure may play a role in  the development of the disease. Research from other fields is presented to  suggest that healthy individuals with low 2D:4D ratio have enhanced sporting  prowess, particularly with regard to activities requiring endurance and  dependent upon slow-twitch muscles. Although studies are of varying quality,  some epidemiological findings in ALS also suggest enhanced sporting prowess, as  well as a higher risk of developing the disease among members of certain  physically active professions. If the 2D:4D finding survives replication then  this might explain the reported elevated risk of ALS among professional  athletes, the military, and manual professions. Such a relationship might also  explain why ALS patients were more likely to have been elite sportspeople in  younger life. This hypothesis may serve as a starting point for debate and  discussion over the nature of ALS risk factors, as well as generating a number  of specific testable hypotheses that may yield insight into the genesis of the  disease.', ""The relative length of the second and fourth digits (2D:4D) is thought to be  negatively related to prenatal testosterone and positively related to prenatal  estrogen.

In this study, we consider the  relationship between 2D:4D and performance among male surfers. Our sample  comprised 46 competitors in the Men's 5-star Professional World Qualifying  Series surfing competition in Newquay, United Kingdom, in 2009. Three  experienced surfing coaches rated the participants for overall surfing ability.  The coach's ratings were significantly correlated with one another and an  overall measure of surfing performance was obtained by calculating the mean of  the 3 ratings. In addition, the final placing of the Newquay competition was  used as an additional performance measure. Mean 2D:4D (SD) was as follows: right  0.994 (0.023) and left 0.976 (0.028). We found that right 2D:4D (but not left  2D:4D or right-left 2D:4D) was significantly negatively correlated with coaches'  ratings (r(s) = 0.58) and the competition result (r(s) = 0.30).

19,How does Rif1 regulate DNA replication?,"['Rif1, originally recognized for its role at telomeres in budding yeast, has been  implicated in a wide variety of cellular processes in mammals, including  pluripotency of stem cells, response to double-strand breaks, and breast cancer  development. As the molecular function of Rif1 is not known, we examined the  consequences of Rif1 deficiency in mouse cells. Rif1 deficiency leads to failure  in embryonic development, and conditional deletion of Rif1 from mouse embryo  fibroblasts affects S-phase progression, rendering cells hypersensitive to  replication poisons. Rif1 deficiency does not alter the activation of the DNA  replication checkpoint but rather affects the execution of repair. RNA  interference to human Rif1 decreases the efficiency of homology-directed repair  (HDR), and Rif1 deficiency results in aberrant aggregates of the HDR factor  Rad51. Consistent with a role in S-phase progression, Rif1 accumulates at  stalled replication forks, preferentially around pericentromeric  heterochromatin. Collectively, these findings reveal a function for Rif1 in the  repair of stalled forks by facilitating HDR.', ""DNA double strand breaks (DSBs) are highly toxic to the cells and accumulation  of DSBs results in several detrimental effects in various cellular processes  which can lead to neurological, immunological and developmental disorders.  Failure of the repair of DSBs spurs mutagenesis and is a driver of  tumorigenesis, thus underscoring the importance of the accurate repair of DSBs.  Two major canonical DSB repair pathways are the non-homologous end joining  (NHEJ) and homologous recombination (HR) pathways. 53BP1 and BRCA1 are the key  mediator proteins which coordinate with other components of the DNA repair  machinery in the NHEJ and HR pathways respectively, and their exclusive  recruitment to DNA breaks/ends potentially decides the choice of repair by  either NHEJ or HR. Recently, Rap1 interacting factor 1 has been identified as an  important component of the DNA repair pathway which acts downstream of the  ATM/53BP1 to inhibit the 5'-3' end resection of broken DNA ends, in-turn  facilitating NHEJ repair and inhibiting homology directed repair. Rif1 is  conserved from yeast to humans but its function has evolved from telomere length  regulation in yeast to the maintenance of genome integrity in mammalian cells.  Recently its role in the maintenance of genomic integrity has been expanded to  include the regulation of chromatin structure, replication timing and intra-S  phase checkpoint. We present a summary of these important findings highlighting  the various aspects of Rif1 functions and discuss the key implications for  genomic integrity."", 'One of the long-standing questions in eukaryotic DNA replication is the  mechanisms that determine where and when a particular segment of the genome is  replicated.

Extensive deregulation of  dormant origins over a wide range of the chromosomes occurs in rif1Δ in the  presence or absence of hydroxyurea (HU). At the same time, many early-firing,  efficient origins are suppressed or delayed in firing timing in rif1Δ. Rif1  binds not only to telomeres, but also to many specific locations on the arm  segments that only partially overlap with the prereplicative complex assembly  sites, although Rif1 tends to bind in the vicinity of the late/dormant origins  activated in rif1Δ. The binding to the arm segments occurs through M to G1 phase  in a manner independent of Taz1 and appears to be essential for the replication  timing program during the normal cell cycle. Our data demonstrate that Rif1 is a  critical determinant of the origin activation program on the fission yeast  chromosomes.', 'Origins of DNA replication on eukaryotic genomes have been observed to fire  during S phase in a coordinated manner. Studies in yeast indicate that origin  firing is affected by several factors, including checkpoint regulators and  chromatin modifiers. However, it is unclear what the mechanisms orchestrating  this coordinated process are. Recent studies have identified factors that  regulate the timing of origin activation, including Rif1 which plays crucial  roles in the regulation of the replication timing program in yeast as well as in  higher eukaryotes. In mammalian cells, Rif1 appears to regulate the structures  of replication timing domains through its ability to organize chromatin loop  structures. Regulation of chromatin architecture by Rif1 may be linked to other  chromosome transactions including recombination, repair, or transcription. This  review summarizes recent progress in the effort to elucidate the regulatory  mechanisms of replication timing of eukaryotic replicons.', 'Mammalian Rif1 is a key regulator of DNA replication timing, double-stranded DNA  break repair, and replication fork restart. Dissecting the molecular functions  of Rif1 is essential to understand how it regulates such diverse processes.  However, Rif1 is a large protein that lacks well defined functional domains and  is predicted to be largely intrinsically disordered; these features have  hampered recombinant expression of Rif1 and subsequent functional  characterization. Here we applied ESPRIT (expression of soluble proteins by  random incremental truncation), an in vitro evolution-like approach, to identify  high yielding soluble fragments encompassing conserved regions I and II (CRI and  CRII) at the C-terminal region of murine Rif1. NMR analysis showed CRI to be  intrinsically disordered, whereas CRII is partially folded. CRII binds cruciform  DNA with high selectivity and micromolar affinity and thus represents a  functional DNA binding domain. Mutational analysis revealed an α-helical region  of CRII to be important for cruciform DNA binding and identified critical  residues. Thus, we present the first structural study of the mammalian Rif1,  identifying a domain that directly links its function to DNA binding. The high  specificity of Rif1 for cruciform structures is significant given the role of  this key protein in regulating origin firing and DNA repair.', 'How the cellular amount of mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) is regulated under normal  conditions and in the presence of genotoxic stress is less understood. We  demonstrate that the inefficient mtDNA replication process of mutant yeast cells  lacking the PIF1 DNA helicase is partly rescued in the absence of the DNA  helicase RRM3. The rescue effect is likely due to the increase in the  deoxynucleoside triphosphates (dNTPs) pool caused by the lack of RRM3. In  contrast, the Pif1p-dependent mtDNA breakage in the presence and absence of  genotoxic stress is not suppressed if RRM3 is lacking suggesting that this  phenotype is likely independent of the dNTP pool. Pif1 protein (Pif1p) was found  to stimulate the incorporation of dNTPs into newly synthesised mtDNA of  gradient-purified mitochondria. We propose that Pif1p that acts likely as a DNA  helicase in mitochondria affects mtDNA replication directly. Possible roles of  Pif1p include the resolution of secondary DNA and/or DNA/RNA structures, the  temporarily displacement of tightly bound mtDNA-binding proteins, or the  stabilization of the mitochondrial replication complex during mtDNA replication.', 'One of the mechanisms controlling the initiation of DNA replication is the  dynamic interaction between Cdt1, which promotes assembly of the pre-replication  license complex, and Geminin, which inhibits it. Specifically, Cdt1 cooperates  with the cell cycle protein Cdc6 to promote loading of the minichromosome  maintenance helicases (MCM) onto the chromatin-bound origin recognition complex  (ORC), by directly interacting with the MCM complex, and by modulating histone  acetylation and inducing chromatin unfolding. Geminin, on the other hand,  prevents the loading of the MCM onto the ORC both by directly binding to Cdt1,  and by modulating Cdt1 stability and activity. Protein levels of Geminin and  Cdt1 are tightly regulated through the cell cycle, and the Cdt1-Geminin complex  likely acts as a molecular switch that can enable or disable the firing of each  origin of replication. In this review we summarize structural studies of Cdt1  and Geminin and subsequent insights into how this molecular switch may function  to ensure DNA is faithfully replicated only once during S phase of each cell  cycle.', 'DNA replication in eukaryotes requires nucleosome disruption ahead of the  replication fork and reassembly behind. An unresolved issue concerns how histone  dynamics are coordinated with fork progression to maintain chromosomal  stability. Here, we characterize a complex in which the human histone chaperone  Asf1 and MCM2-7, the putative replicative helicase, are connected through a  histone H3-H4 bridge. Depletion of Asf1 by RNA interference impedes DNA  unwinding at replication sites, and similar defects arise from overproduction of  new histone H3-H4 that compromises Asf1 function. These data link Asf1 chaperone  function, histone supply, and replicative unwinding of DNA in chromatin. We  propose that Asf1, as a histone acceptor and donor, handles parental and new  histones at the replication fork via an Asf1-(H3-H4)-MCM2-7 intermediate and  thus provides a means to fine-tune replication fork progression and histone  supply and demand.', 'Replication forks encounter impediments as they move through the genome,  including natural barriers due to stable protein complexes and highly  transcribed genes. Unlike lesions generated by exogenous damage, natural  barriers are encountered in every S phase. Like humans, Schizosaccharomyces  pombe encodes a single Pif1 family DNA helicase, Pfh1. Here, we show that Pfh1  is required for efficient fork movement in the ribosomal DNA, the mating type  locus, tRNA, 5S ribosomal RNA genes, and genes that are highly transcribed by  RNA polymerase II. In addition, converged replication forks accumulated at all  of these sites in the absence of Pfh1. The effects of Pfh1 on DNA replication  are likely direct, as it had high binding to sites whose replication was  impaired in its absence. Replication in the absence of Pfh1 resulted in DNA  damage specifically at those sites that bound high levels of Pfh1 in wild-type  cells and whose replication was slowed in its absence. Cells depleted of Pfh1  were inviable if they also lacked the human TIMELESS homolog Swi1, a replisome  component that stabilizes stalled forks. Thus, Pfh1 promotes DNA replication and  separation of converged replication forks and suppresses DNA damage at  hard-to-replicate sites.', 'The replication of eukaryotic chromosomes is organized temporally and spatially  within the nucleus through epigenetic regulation of replication origin function.  The characteristic initiation timing of specific origins is thought to reflect  their chromatin environment or sub-nuclear positioning, however the mechanism  remains obscure. Here we show that the yeast Forkhead transcription factors,  Fkh1 and Fkh2, are global determinants of replication origin timing. Forkhead  regulation of origin timing is independent of local levels or changes of  transcription. Instead, we show that Fkh1 and Fkh2 are required for the  clustering of early origins and their association with the key initiation factor  Cdc45 in G1 phase, suggesting that Fkh1 and Fkh2 selectively recruit origins to  emergent replication factories. Fkh1 and Fkh2 bind Fkh-activated origins, and  interact physically with ORC, providing a plausible mechanism to cluster  origins. These findings add a new dimension to our understanding of the  epigenetic basis for differential origin regulation and its connection to  chromosomal domain organization.']","Rif1 (Rap1-interacting-factor-1), originally identified as a telomere-binding factor in yeast, is a critical determinant of the replication timing programme in human cells. Rif1 tightly binds to nuclear-insoluble structures at late-M-to-early-G1 and regulates chromatin-loop sizes. Furthermore, Rif1 colocalizes specifically with the mid-S replication foci. Thus, Rif1 establishes the mid-S replication domains that are restrained from being activated at early-S-phase. Overall, Rif1 plays crucial roles in determining the replication timing domain structures in human cells through regulating higher-order chromatin architecture. This function of Rif1 depends on its interaction with PP1 phosphatases and the PP1/Rif1 interaction is downregulated by the phosphorylation of Rif1, most likely by CDK/DDK."

DEAH-Box helicase 36  (DHX36), a member of the large DExD/H box helicase family, enzymatically unwinds  both G4 DNA and G4 RNA. By exerting its G4 helicase function, DHX36 regulates  transcription, genomic stability, telomere maintenance, translation and RNA  metabolism. This review will provide an overview of G4s and DHX36, including  DHX36's potential role in neuronal development and neurodegeneration. We  conclude with a discussion of the possible functions of G4s and DHX36 in the  aging brain."", ""Single-stranded DNA (ssDNA) and RNA regions that include at least four closely  spaced runs of three or more consecutive guanosines strongly tend to fold into  stable G-quadruplexes (G4s). G4s play key roles as DNA regulatory sites and as  kinetic traps that can inhibit biological processes, but how G4s are regulated  in cells remains largely unknown. Here, we developed a kinetic framework for G4  disruption by DEAH-box helicase 36 (DHX36), the dominant G4 resolvase in human  cells. Using tetramolecular DNA and RNA G4s with four to six G-quartets, we  found that DHX36-mediated disruption is highly efficient, with rates that depend  on G4 length under saturating conditions (kcat) but not under subsaturating  conditions (kcat/Km ). These results suggest that a step during G4 disruption  limits the kcat value and that DHX36 binding limits kcat/Km Similar results were  obtained for unimolecular DNA G4s. DHX36 activity depended on a 3' ssDNA  extension and was blocked by a polyethylene glycol linker, indicating that DHX36  loads onto the extension and translocates 3'-5' toward the G4. DHX36 unwound  dsDNA poorly compared with G4s of comparable intrinsic lifetime. Interestingly,  we observed that DHX36 has striking 3'-extension sequence preferences that  differ for G4 disruption and dsDNA unwinding, most likely arising from  differences in the rate-limiting step for the two activities. Our results  indicate that DHX36 disrupts G4s with a conventional helicase mechanism that is  tuned for great efficiency and specificity for G4s. The dependence of DHX36 on  the 3'-extension sequence suggests that the extent of formation of genomic G4s  may not track directly with G4 stability."", 'The unwinding of nucleic acid secondary structures within cells is crucial to  maintain genomic integrity and prevent abortive transcription and translation  initiation. DHX36, also known as RHAU or G4R1, is a DEAH-box ATP-dependent  helicase highly specific for DNA and RNA G-quadruplexes (G4s). A fundamental  mechanistic understanding of the interaction between helicases and their G4  substrates is important to elucidate G4 biology and pave the way toward  G4-targeted therapies. Here we analyze how the thermodynamic stability of G4  substrates affects binding and unwinding by DHX36. We modulated the stability of  the G4 substrates by varying the sequence and the number of G-tetrads and by  using small, G4-stabilizing molecules. We found an inverse correlation between  the thermodynamic stability of the G4 substrates and rates of unwinding by  DHX36. In stark contrast, the ATPase activity of the helicase was largely  independent of substrate stability pointing toward a decoupling mechanism akin  to what has been observed for many double-stranded DEAD-box RNA helicases. Our  study provides the first evidence that DHX36 uses a local, non-processive  mechanism to unwind G4 substrates, reminiscent of that of eukaryotic initiation  factor 4A (eIF4A) on double-stranded substrates.', 'DHX36 is a member of the DExD/H box helicase family, which comprises a large  number of proteins involved in various cellular functions.

G4s are alternative nucleic acid structures, which influence many cellular  pathways on a transcriptional and post-transcriptional level. In this review we  provide an overview of the current knowledge about DHX36 structure, substrate  specificity, and mechanism of action based on the available models and crystal  structures.

Driven  by ATP hydrolysis, they exert force to dissociate hybridized RNAs, dislocate  bound proteins or unwind secondary structure elements in RNAs. The sub-cellular  localization of DEAH-helicases and their concomitant association with different  pathways in RNA metabolism, such as pre-mRNA splicing or ribosome biogenesis,  can be guided by cofactor proteins that specifically recruit and simultaneously  activate them. Here we review the mode of action of a large class of  DEAH-specific adaptor proteins of the G-patch family. Defined only by their  eponymous short glycine-rich motif, which is sufficient for helicase binding and  stimulation, this family encompasses an immensely varied array of domain  compositions and is linked to an equally diverse set of functions. G-patch  proteins are conserved throughout eukaryotes and are even encoded within  retroviruses. They are involved in mRNA, rRNA and snoRNA maturation, telomere  maintenance and the innate immune response.

In particular,  G-quadruplexes occupy strategic locations in genomic DNA and both coding and  noncoding RNA molecules, being involved in many essential cellular and  organismal functions. In this review, we first outline the fundamental  structural features of G-quadruplexes and then focus on the concept that these  DNA and RNA structures convey a distinctive layer of epigenetic information that  is critical for the complex regulation, either positive or negative, of  biological activities in different contexts. In this framework, we summarize and  discuss the proposed mechanisms underlying the functions of G-quadruplexes and  their interacting factors. Furthermore, we give special emphasis to the  interplay between G-quadruplex formation/disruption and other epigenetic marks,  including biochemical modifications of DNA bases and histones, nucleosome  positioning, and three-dimensional organization of chromatin.

Because many processes involving RNA metabolism are spatially organized within  the cell, we examined the subcellular distribution of a human DEAD box protein,  DDX1, to identify possible biological functions. Immunofluorescence labeling of  DDX1 demonstrated that in addition to widespread punctate nucleoplasmic  labeling, DDX1 is found in discrete nuclear foci approximately 0.5 microm in  diameter. Costaining with anti-Sm and anti-promyelocytic leukemia (PML)  antibodies indicates that DDX1 foci are frequently located next to Cajal  (coiled) bodies and less frequently, to PML bodies. Most importantly, costaining  with anti-CstF-64 antibody indicates that DDX1 foci colocalize with cleavage  bodies. By microscopic fluorescence resonance energy transfer, we show that  labeled DDX1 resides within a Förster distance of 10 nm of labeled CstF-64  protein in both the nucleoplasm and within cleavage bodies.  Coimmunoprecipitation analysis indicates that a proportion of CstF-64 protein  resides in the same complex as DDX1.

In humans, five RecQ helicases have been identified and three of them  namely, WRN, BLM and RecQL4 have been linked to genetic diseases characterized  by genome instability, premature aging and cancer predisposition. This helicase  family plays important roles in various DNA repair pathways including protecting  the genome from illegitimate recombination during chromosome segregation in  mitosis and assuring genome stability.

Among the 22  human Nudix proteins (identified by the sequence signature), some remain  uncharacterized as enzymes without a defined substrate. Here, we reveal that the  NUDT18 protein, whose substrate was unknown, can degrade  8-oxo-7,8-dihydroguanine (8-oxo-Gua)-containing nucleoside diphosphates to the  monophosphates. Because this enzyme is closely related to MTH1 (NUDT1) and MTH2  (NUDT15), we propose that it should be named MTH3. Although these three human  proteins resemble each other in their sequences, their substrate specificities  differ considerably. MTH1 cleaves 8-oxo-dGTP but not 8-oxo-dGDP, whereas MTH2  can degrade both 8-oxo-dGTP and 8-oxo-dGDP, although the intrinsic enzyme  activity of MTH2 is considerably lower than that of MTH1. On the other hand,  MTH3 is specifically active against 8-oxo-dGDP and hardly cleaves 8-oxo-dGTP.  Other types of oxidized nucleoside diphosphates, 2-hydroxy-dADP and  8-hydroxy-dADP, were also hydrolyzed by MTH3. Another notable feature of the  MTH3 enzyme is its action toward the ribonucleotide counterpart. MTH3 can  degrade 8-oxo-GDP as efficiently as 8-oxo-dGDP, which is in contrast to the  finding that MTH1 and MTH2 show a limited activity against the ribonucleotide  counterpart, 8-oxo-GTP.

21,What is the Drosophila melanogaster Groucho protein?,"['Drosophila Groucho (Gro) is the founding member of a family of metazoan  corepressors. Gro mediates repression through interactions with a myriad of  DNA-binding repressor proteins to direct the silencing of genes involved in many  developmental processes, including neurogenesis and patterning of the main body  axis, as well as receptor tyrosine kinase/Ras/MAPK, Notch, Wingless (Wg)/Wnt,  and Decapentaplegic (Dpp) signaling. Gro mediates repression by multiple  molecular mechanisms, depending on the regulatory context. Because Gro is a  broadly expressed nuclear factor, whereas its repressor partners display  restricted temporal and spatial distribution, it was presumed that this  corepressor played permissive rather than instructive roles in development.  However, a wide range of studies demonstrates that this is not the case. Gro can  sense and integrate many cellular inputs to modulate the expression of variety  of genes, making it a versatile corepressor with crucial instructive roles in  development and signaling.', 'The Groucho/Tle family of corepressor proteins has important roles in  development and in adult tissue in both Protostomes and Deuterostomes. In  Drosophila, a single member of this family has been identified. Unlike in  Protostomes, most Deutrostomes contain more than two full-length Tle genes. In  this study, I analyse the genomic organization and phylogenetic relationship  between the long and short forms of the Groucho/Tle family members in Chordata.  The genomic location and sequence similarities suggest that Aes/Grg5 and  Tle6/Grg6 arose from duplication of the Tle2 gene; each evolved independently  and acquired new functions as negative regulators of the other Tle proteins.  Based on these data, a model for Groucho/Tle gene evolution is proposed.', 'The caudal homeobox (cdx) gene family is critical for specification of caudal  body formation and erythropoiesis. In zebrafish, cdx4 expression is controlled  by the Wnt pathway, but the molecular mechanism of this regulation is not fully  understood. Here, we provide evidence that Tcf3 suppresses cdx4 expression  through direct binding to multiple sites in the cdx4 gene regulatory region.  Tcf3 requires corepressor molecules such as Groucho (Gro)/TLE and HDAC1 for  activity. Using zebrafish embryos and cultured mammalian cells, we show that the  transcription factor E4f1 derepresses cdx4 by dissociating corepressor proteins  from Tcf3 without inhibiting its binding to cis-regulatory sites in the DNA.  Further, the E3 ubiquitin ligase Lnx2b, acting as a scaffold protein  irrespective of its enzymatic activity, counteracts the effects of E4f1. We  propose that the modulation of Tcf3 repressor function by E4f1 assures precise  and robust regulation of cdx4 expression in the caudal domain of the embryo.', 'Groucho proteins are abundant and broadly expressed nuclear factors that lack  intrinsic DNA-binding activity but can interact with a variety of DNA-binding  proteins. The recruitment of Groucho to specific gene regulatory sequences  results in transcriptional repression. In both invertebrates and vertebrates,  Groucho family members act as important regulators of several signaling  mechanisms, including the Notch, Wingless/Wnt and Dpp/BMP/TGF-beta signaling  pathways. Recent studies of embryonic development in several species point to an  important role for Groucho in the regulation of multiple patterning and  differentiation events. Moreover, a deregulated expression of human Groucho  family members is correlated with several neoplastic conditions.

One of these latter mutations, encoding an  amino-terminal protein truncation that lacks part of the Q domain, abolishes  oligomerization in vitro and renders the protein unstable in vivo. Nevertheless,  the mutation is not a null: maternal mutant embryos have intermediate  segmentation phenotypes and relatively normal terminal patterning suggesting  that the mutant protein retains partial corepressor activity.

After reduction,  papilin electrophoresed in sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel  electrophoresis as a broad band of about 900,000 apparent molecular weight and  the core protein as a narrow band of approximately 400,000.

The buoyant density of papilin in CsCl/4 M guanidine  hydrochloride is 1.4 g/ml, that of the core protein is much less. Papilin forms  oligomers linked by disulfide bridges, as shown by sodium dodecyl  sulfate-agarose gel electrophoresis and electron microscopy. The protomer is a  225 +/- 15-nm thread which is disulfide-linked into a loop with fine, protruding  thread ends. Oligomers form clover-leaf-like structures.

There are  about 80 O-linked carbohydrate chains/core protein molecule. Sulfate is attached  to these chains. The O-linkage is through an unidentified neutral sugar. Papilin  is largely resistant to common glycosidases and several proteases. The degree of  sulfation varies with the sulfate concentration of the incubation medium.

Although a repressor could function by recruiting just a single  co-repressor, many can recruit more than one, with Drosophila Brinker (Brk)  recruiting the co-repressors CtBP and Groucho (Gro), in addition to possessing a  third repression domain, 3R. Previous studies indicated that Gro is sufficient  for Brk to repress targets in the wing, questioning why it should need to  recruit CtBP, a short-range co-repressor, when Gro is known to be able to  function over longer distances. To resolve this we have used genomic engineering  to generate a series of brk mutants that are unable to recruit Gro, CtBP and/or  have 3R deleted. These reveal that although the recruitment of Gro is necessary  and can be sufficient for Brk to make an almost morphologically wild-type fly,  it is insufficient during oogenesis, where Brk must utilize CtBP and 3R to  pattern the egg shell appropriately. Gro insufficiency during oogenesis can be  explained by its downregulation in Brk-expressing cells through phosphorylation  downstream of EGFR signaling.', 'The yellow locus in Drosophila is involved in both cuticle development and  behaviour.

High levels of yellow-B mRNA are present in the larval-pupal stages, but  the gene is also expressed in the head. Bioinformatics analysis indicates that  the Drosophila genome encodes at least 7 members of the Yellow family  distributed among chromosomes 2, 3, and X.

Preclinical data suggest greater anticancer effect when mTOR inhibitors are  combined with cytotoxic chemotherapy. We performed a Phase I assessment of the  combination of temsirolimus and capecitabine in patients with advanced solid  tumors. METHODS: Patients were enrolled in an alternating dose escalation of  temsirolimus (at 15 or 25\xa0mg IV weekly) and capecitabine (at 750, 1000, and  1250\xa0mg/m2 twice daily) in separate Q2-week and Q3-week cohorts. At the  recommended Phase II doses (RP2Ds) of temsirolimus and capecitabine (Q2), seven  patients were also treated with oxaliplatin (85\xa0mg/m2 , day 1)\xa0to determine  triplet combination safety and efficacy. RESULTS: Forty-five patients were enrolled and 41 were evaluable\xa0for  dose-limiting toxicities (DLTs). The most common adverse events (AEs) were  mucositis, fatigue, and thrombocytopenia. The most common grade 3/4 AEs were  hypophosphatemia and anemia. Five patients had DLTs, including hypophosphatemia,  mucositis, and thrombocytopenia. The RP2Ds were temsirolimus 25\xa0mg +capecitabine  1000\xa0mg/m2 (Q2); and temsirolimus 25\xa0mg +capecitabine 750\xa0mg/m2 \xa0(Q3).

Thirty-five RR NHL patients (57% de novo large cell [DLBCL] or grade 3B  follicular [FL], 26% transformed DLBCL, 9% grade 3A FL, 3% mantle cell; median  age = 62, median prior therapies = 1) were treated. Median follow-up was  24.1\u2009months. ORR was 69% (CR = 49%, PR = 20% [ORR = 70%, CR = 50%, PR = 20% in  the de novo DLBCL/grade 3B FL subgroup]). Median progression-free survival was  5.1\u2009months and overall-survival 26.2\u2009months. Twelve patients subsequently  underwent stem cell transplantation. The most common non-hematologic grade 3-4  toxicities were neutropenic fever and hypophosphatemia. There were no  treatment-related deaths. In conclusion, BOCE is a safe and effective outpatient  salvage regimen for patients with RR NHL and serves as an effective bridge to  stem cell transplantation.', 'Administration of intravenous ferric carboxymaltose (FCM) for iron-deficient  patients suffering heart failure with reduced ejection fraction (HFrEF) has been  associated with transient hypophosphatemia. We sought to investigate and model  the effect of intravenous FCM on phosphate levels in iron-deficient patients  with HFrEF. In this single-center retrospective study, serum phosphate levels,  recorded for clinical reasons, were collected out to 60 days following  intravenous FCM. Hypophosphatemia was defined as a nadir serum phosphate level  <0.64\xa0mmol/L. This was further categorized as severe (0.4 to <0.64\xa0mmol/L) and  extreme (<0.4\xa0mmol/L). Factors associated with hypophosphatemia and change in  serum phosphate over time were explored. Of 173 patients included, 47 (27%)  experienced hypophosphatemia, 44 (25%) were classified as severe, and 3 (2%)  extreme. Risk of hypophosphatemia was increased for patients with a creatinine  clearance between 60 and <90\xa0mL/min (odds ratio, 2.3; 95% confidence interval,  1.0-5.5), while <60\xa0mL/min was protective. The median time to nadir in patients  who experienced hypophosphatemia was 8 (interquartile range, 4-16) days, with a  return to baseline levels at 6 weeks. Biochemically relevant hypophosphatemia is  common following a single dose of intravenous FCM. The median time to nadir was  8 days, and creatinine clearance may influence phosphate levels following  intravenous FCM. These observations support the need to increase awareness among  clinicians administering intravenous FCM to iron-deficient patients with HFrEF.', 'Imatinib is the drug of first choice for most patients with chronic phase  chronic myeloid leukemia (CML). Although it is generally well tolerated, a  number of hematological and nonhematological side-effects have been described.  We report here that imatinib induces hypophosphatemia in a high proportion of  our series of CML patients previously treated with interferon alpha, and that  this previously unreported side effect is associated with response.', 'OBJECTIVE: To provide an outline of the drugs and nutritional therapy that could  contribute to the development of hypophosphatemia in the critically ill patient. DATA SOURCES: Computerized abstracting services, references to primary  literature articles, and review publications were screened for references to  drug- or nutrition-related hypophosphatemia. STUDY SELECTION: Studies primarily describing responses in adults were selected.  Animal research is described that illustrates findings in humans. DATA EXTRACTION: Information was abstracted from the findings of individual case  reports and clinical trials. DATA SYNTHESIS: Data are organized by mechanism of possible effect on serum  phosphate concentration. No reference is made to drugs that do not have an  effect on phosphate metabolism. CONCLUSIONS: Hypophosphatemia can have significant effects that would hinder  recovery of the critically ill patient. Antacids, catecholamines,  beta-adrenergic agonists, sodium bicarbonate, and acetazolamide are commonly  used therapeutic agents that could contribute significantly to the development  of hypophosphatemia. Provision of nutrition to the chronically malnourished  individual or chronic administration of phosphate-depleted parenteral nutrition  could produce symptoms associated with hypophosphatemia. Other drugs could have  a mild effect on lowering serum phosphate concentrations, but would be unlikely  to produce symptoms unless combined with other etiologies of hypophosphatemia.', 'BACKGROUND: X-linked hypophosphatemia is characterized by increased secretion of  fibroblast growth factor 23 (FGF-23), which leads to hypophosphatemia and  consequently rickets, osteomalacia, and skeletal deformities. We investigated  burosumab, a monoclonal antibody that targets FGF-23, in patients with X-linked  hypophosphatemia. METHODS: In an open-label, phase 2 trial, we randomly assigned 52 children with  X-linked hypophosphatemia, in a 1:1 ratio, to receive subcutaneous burosumab  either every 2 weeks or every 4 weeks; the dose was adjusted to achieve a serum  phosphorus level at the low end of the normal range. The primary end point was  the change from baseline to weeks 40 and 64 in the Thacher rickets severity  total score (ranging from 0 to 10, with higher scores indicating greater disease  severity). In addition, the Radiographic Global Impression of Change was used to  evaluate rachitic changes from baseline to week 40 and to week 64. Additional  end points were changes in pharmacodynamic markers, linear growth, physical  ability, and patient-reported outcomes and the incidence of adverse events. RESULTS: The mean Thacher rickets severity total score decreased from 1.9 at  baseline to 0.8 at week 40 with every-2-week dosing and from 1.7 at baseline to  1.1 at week 40 with every-4-week dosing (P<0.001 for both comparisons); these  improvements persisted at week 64. The mean serum phosphorus level increased  after the first dose in both groups, and more than half the patients in both  groups had levels within the normal range (3.2 to 6.1 mg per deciliter [1.0 to  2.0 mmol per liter]) by week 6. Stable serum phosphorus levels were maintained  through week 64 with every-2-week dosing. Renal tubular phosphate reabsorption  increased from baseline in both groups, with an overall mean increase of 0.98 mg  per deciliter (0.32 mmol per liter). The mean dose of burosumab at week 40 was  0.98 mg per kilogram of body weight with every-2-week dosing and 1.50 mg per  kilogram with every-4-week dosing. Across both groups, the mean serum alkaline  phosphatase level decreased from 459 U per liter at baseline to 369 U per liter  at week 64. The mean standing-height z score increased in both groups, with  greater improvement seen at all time points with every-2-week dosing (an  increase from baseline of 0.19 at week 64) than with every-4-week dosing (an  increase from baseline of 0.12 at week 64). Physical ability improved and pain  decreased. Nearly all the adverse events were mild or moderate in severity. CONCLUSIONS: In children with X-linked hypophosphatemia, treatment with  burosumab improved renal tubular phosphate reabsorption, serum phosphorus  levels, linear growth, and physical function and reduced pain and the severity  of rickets.

They have been seen after the introduction of modern lipid-lowering drugs more  regularly. The first description after medication with clofibrate dates back to  1968. Apparently, all fibrates can induce myopathy. It usually starts after a  few days of medication, or after prolonged use, showing muscle weakness and/or  pain. Concomitantly, the enzyme creatininephosphokinase (CPK) is raised  dramatically. Muscular necrosis can follow leading secondarily to kidney  failure, and eventually to death. For the class of statins, myopathy was more  often seen after their introduction, and it became their most feared adverse  effect, especially in combination of statins with other drugs (mibefradil,  gemfibrozil, cyclosporin). In animal models the evolution of the disease and the  mechanism of action may be elucidated. Though strong epidemiological data are  lacking, the incidence of myopathy is probably similar for all lipid-lowering  drugs and is in the range of 0.1-0.5% with monotherapy, increasing to 0.5-2.5%  with combination therapy. Severe cases of rhabdomyolysis are rarer, but may have  a significant mortality. The market success of cerivastatin within a short  period has led to 100s of myopathies and some dozens of deaths. Though  interactions on metabolism and ensuing high plasma levels can partially explain  myopathy as intoxication, there are strong indications that other (endocrine,  metabolic, genetic) factors might play a role in the pathophysiology. The  patient population at risk should better be defined and withheld from  myopathy-inducing drugs.', 'INTRODUCTION: Balovaptan, an investigational vasopressin 1a receptor antagonist  that has been evaluated for improvement of social communication and interaction,  is primarily metabolized by cytochrome P450 3A4 (CYP3A4). METHODS: Two single-center, non-randomized, two-period, phase 1 studies assessed  the effect of the strong CYP3A4 inhibitor itraconazole (study NCT03579719) or  the strong CYP3A4 inducer rifampicin (study NCT03586726) at steady state on the  pharmacokinetics (PK) of steady-state balovaptan in healthy volunteers.  Participants received balovaptan (5 or 10\xa0mg/day) alone for 10\xa0days, or in  combination with itraconazole (200\xa0mg/day) for 15\xa0days, or rifampicin  (600\xa0mg/day) for 10\xa0days, following balovaptan washout and  itraconazole/rifampicin pre-dosing. Geometric mean ratios (GMRs) and 90%  confidence intervals (90% CIs) for the area under the concentration-time curve  over the dosing interval (AUC) and maximum plasma concentration (Cmax) of  balovaptan dosed with vs. without itraconazole/rifampicin were estimated from a  mixed effects model. RESULTS: Both studies comprised 15-16 healthy male and female volunteers.  Itraconazole 200\xa0mg/day elevated steady-state exposure to 5\xa0mg/day balovaptan  approximately 4.5-5.5-fold (Day 15 GMR [90% CI], 4.46 [4.06-4.90] for Cmax and  5.57 [5.00-6.21] for AUC) and extended the time to steady state from\u2009~\u20095\xa0days  to\u2009~\u200913-14\xa0days. Rifampicin 600\xa0mg/day resulted in\u2009~\u200990% reductions in both the  Cmax (Day 10 GMR [90% CI], 0.14 [0.12-0.15]) and AUC (0.07 [0.06-0.07]) of  balovaptan 10\xa0mg/day. Time to balovaptan steady state could not be determined  with rifampicin. There were no clinically significant safety findings in either  study. CONCLUSIONS: Strong modulators of CYP3A4 activity will significantly alter the  PK of balovaptan, with the effect of CYP3A4 induction greater than that of  inhibition. Caution should be taken when concomitantly dosing balovaptan with  moderate or strong CYP3A4 inducers or strong CYP3A4 inhibitors. TRIAL REGISTRATION NUMBER: NCT03579719; NCT03586726.', ""Persistent mild to moderate hyperoxaluria (PMMH) is a common side effect of  bariatric surgery. However, PMMH's role in the progression to calcium oxalate  (CaOx) urolithiasis and its potential effects on non-renal tissues are unknown.  To address these points, a trigger\xa0+\xa0maintenance (T\xa0+\xa0Mt) model of PMMH was  developed in rats (Experiment 1). The trigger was an i.p. injection of PBS  (TPBS) or 288\xa0μmol sodium oxalate (T288). Maintenance (Mt) was given via  minipumps dispensing PBS or 7.5-30\xa0μmol potassium oxalate/day for 28\xa0days.  Urinary oxalate ranged from 7.7\xa0±\xa00.8\xa0μmol/day for TPBS\xa0+\xa0MtPBS to  18.2\xa0±\xa01.5\xa0μmol/day for T288\xa0+\xa0Mt30 (p\xa0≤\xa00.0005). All rats receiving T288  developed CaOx nephrocalcinosis, and many developed 'stones'. This was also true  for Mt doses that did not elevate urinary oxalate above that of TPBS\xa0+\xa0MtPBS  (p\xa0>\xa00.1) and for rats that did not have a detectable surge in urinary oxalate  post T288. When TPBS was administered, CaOx nephrocalcinosis did not develop  regardless of the Mt dose even if urinary oxalate was elevated compared to  TPBS\xa0+\xa0MtPBS (p\xa0≤\xa00.0005). One of the risks associated with PMMH is oxalate  accumulation within tissues. Hence, in a second set of experiments (Experiment  2) different doses of oxalate (Mt0.05, Mt15, Mt30) labeled with (14)C-oxalate  ((14)C-Ox) were administered by minipump for 13\xa0days. Tissues were harvested and  (14)C-Ox accumulation assessed by scintillation counting. (14)C-Ox accumulated  in a dose dependent manner (p\xa0≤\xa00.004) in bone, kidney, muscle, liver, heart,  kidney, lungs, spleen, and testis. All these tissues exhibited (14)C-Ox  concentrations higher (p\xa0≤\xa00.05) than the plasma. Extrapolation of our results  to patients suggests that PMMH patients should take extra care to avoid  dietary-induced spikes in oxalate excretion to help prevent CaOx  nephrocalcinosis or stone development. Monitoring for oxalate accumulation  within tissues susceptible to damage by oxalate or CaOx crystals may also be  required."", 'Colesevelam hydrochloride and lanthanum carbonate interfere with the absorption  of levothyroxine.']","Drug induced hypophosphatemia can occur with iron therapy as well a treatment with ferric carboxymaltose,  elotuzumab, cemiplimab, Temsirolimus,  capecitabine, panobinostat, bendamustine, ofatumumab, carboplatin and etoposide (BOCE)"
23,Is H4K20 methylation associated with DNA replication?,"['The transition between proliferation and quiescence is frequently associated  with changes in gene expression, extent of chromatin compaction, and histone  modifications, but whether changes in chromatin state actually regulate cell  cycle exit with quiescence is unclear. We find that primary human fibroblasts  induced into quiescence exhibit tighter chromatin compaction. Mass spectrometry  analysis of histone modifications reveals that H4K20me2 and H4K20me3 increase in  quiescence and other histone modifications are present at similar levels in  proliferating and quiescent cells. Analysis of cells in S, G2/M, and G1 phases  shows that H4K20me1 increases after S phase and is converted to H4K20me2 and  H4K20me3 in quiescence. Knockdown of the enzyme that creates H4K20me3 results in  an increased fraction of cells in S phase, a defect in exiting the cell cycle,  and decreased chromatin compaction. Overexpression of Suv4-20h1, the enzyme that  creates H4K20me2 from H4K20me1, results in G2 arrest, consistent with a role for  H4K20me1 in mitosis. The results suggest that the same lysine on H4K20 may, in  its different methylation states, facilitate mitotic functions in M phase and  promote chromatin compaction and cell cycle exit in quiescent cells.', 'The molecular biology of histone H4 lysine 20 (H4K20) methylation, like many  other post-translational modifications of histones, has been the subject of  intensive interest in recent years. While there is an emerging consensus linking  H4K20me1, H4K20me2, and H4K20me3 to transcription, repair, and constitutive  heterochromatin, respectively, the specific details of these associations and  the biological mechanisms by which the methylated histones are introduced and  function are now the subject of active investigation. Although a large number of  methylases capable of methylating H4K20 have been identified and characterized;  there is no known demethylase of H4K20, though the search is ongoing.  Additionally, many recent studies have been directed at understanding the role  of methylated H4K20 and other histone modifications associated with different  biological processes in the context of a combinatorial histone code. It seems  likely that continued study of the methylation of H4K20 will yield extremely  valuable insights concerning the regulation of histone modifications before and  during cell division and the impact of these modifications on subsequent gene  expression.', ""Nucleosome dynamics facilitated by histone turnover is required for  transcription as well as DNA replication and repair. Histone turnover is often  associated with various histone modifications such as H3K56 acetylation  (H3K56Ac), H3K36 methylation (H3K36me), and H4K20 methylation (H4K20me). In  order to correlate histone modifications and transcription-dependent histone  turnover, we performed genome wide analyses for euchromatic regions in  G2/M-arrested fission yeast. The results show that transcription-dependent  histone turnover at 5' promoter and 3' termination regions is directly  correlated with the occurrence of H3K56Ac and H4K20 mono-methylation (H4K20me1)  in actively transcribed genes. Furthermore, the increase of H3K56Ac and H4K20me1  and antisense RNA production was observed in the absence of the histone H3K36  methyltransferase Set2 and histone deacetylase complex (HDAC) that are involved  in the suppression of histone turnover within the coding regions. These results  together indicate that H4K20me1 as well as H3K56Ac are bona fide marks for  transcription-dependent histone turnover in fission yeast."", 'Maintenance of genomic integrity is essential to ensure normal organismal  development and to prevent diseases such as cancer. Nuclear DNA is packaged into  chromatin, and thus genome maintenance can be influenced by distinct chromatin  environments. In particular, post-translational modifications of histones have  emerged as key regulators of genomic integrity. Intense research during the past  few years has revealed histone H4 lysine 20 methylation (H4K20me) as critically  important for the biological processes that ensure genome integrity, such as DNA  damage repair, DNA replication and chromatin compaction. The distinct H4K20  methylation states are mediated by SET8/PR-Set7 that catalyses monomethylation  of H4K20, whereas SUV4-20H1 and SUV4-20H2 enzymes mediate further H4K20  methylation to H4K20me2 and H4K20me3. Disruption of these H4K20-specific histone  methyltransferases leads to genomic instability, demonstrating the important  functions of H4K20 methylation in genome maintenance. In this review, we explain  molecular mechanisms underlying these defects and discuss novel ideas for  furthering our understanding of genome maintenance in higher eukaryotes.', 'The methylation state of lysine 20 on histone H4 (H4K20) has been linked to  chromatin compaction, transcription, DNA repair and DNA replication.  Monomethylation of H4K20 (H4K20me1) is mediated by the cell cycle-regulated  histone methyltransferase PR-Set7. PR-Set7 depletion in mammalian cells results  in defective S phase progression and the accumulation of DNA damage, which has  been partially attributed to defects in origin selection and activation.  However, these studies were limited to only a handful of mammalian origins, and  it remains unclear how PR-Set7 and H4K20 methylation impact the replication  program on a genomic scale. We employed genetic, cytological, and genomic  approaches to better understand the role of PR-Set7 and H4K20 methylation in  regulating DNA replication and genome stability in Drosophila cells. We find  that deregulation of H4K20 methylation had no impact on origin activation  throughout the genome. Instead, depletion of PR-Set7 and loss of H4K20me1  results in the accumulation of DNA damage and an ATR-dependent cell cycle  arrest. Coincident with the ATR-dependent cell cycle arrest, we find increased  DNA damage that is specifically limited to late replicating regions of the  Drosophila genome, suggesting that PR-Set7-mediated monomethylation of H4K20 is  critical for maintaining the genomic integrity of late replicating domains.', 'The enzymatic control of the setting and maintenance of symmetric and  non-symmetric DNA methylation patterns in a particular genome context is not  well understood. Here, we describe a comprehensive analysis of DNA methylation  patterns generated by high resolution sequencing of hairpin-bisulfite amplicons  of selected single copy genes and repetitive elements (LINE1, B1,  IAP-LTR-retrotransposons, and major satellites). The analysis unambiguously  identifies a substantial amount of regional incomplete methylation maintenance,  i.e. hemimethylated CpG positions, with variant degrees among cell types.  Moreover, non-CpG cytosine methylation is confined to ESCs and exclusively  catalysed by Dnmt3a and Dnmt3b. This sequence position-, cell type-, and  region-dependent non-CpG methylation is strongly linked to neighboring CpG  methylation and requires the presence of Dnmt3L. The generation of a  comprehensive data set of 146,000 CpG dyads was used to apply and develop  parameter estimated hidden Markov models (HMM) to calculate the relative  contribution of DNA methyltransferases (Dnmts) for de novo and maintenance DNA  methylation. The comparative modelling included wild-type ESCs and mutant ESCs  deficient for Dnmt1, Dnmt3a, Dnmt3b, or Dnmt3a/3b, respectively. The HMM  analysis identifies a considerable de novo methylation activity for Dnmt1 at  certain repetitive elements and single copy sequences. Dnmt3a and Dnmt3b  contribute de novo function. However, both enzymes are also essential to  maintain symmetrical CpG methylation at distinct repetitive and single copy  sequences in ESCs.', 'The correlation between DNA methylation and a subset of histone  post-translational modifications (positive and negative) has hinted at an  underlying regulatory crosstalk between histone marks and DNA methylation in  patterning the human DNA methylome, an idea further supported by corresponding  alterations to both histone marks and DNA methylation during malignant  transformation. This study investigated the framework by which histone marks  influence DNA methylation at a genome-wide level. Using RNAi in a pluripotent  human embryonic carcinoma cell line we depleted essential components of the  MLL/COMPASS, polycomb repressive complex 2 (PRC2), and PRC1 histone modifying  complexes that establish, respectively, the post-translational modifications  H3K4me3, H3K27me3, and H2AK119ub, and assayed the impact of the subsequent  depletion of these marks on the DNA methylome. Absence of H2AK119ub resulted  predominantly in hypomethylation across the genome. Depletion of H3K4me3 and,  surprisingly, H3K27me3 caused CpG island hypermethylation at a subset of loci.  Intriguingly, many promoters were co-regulated by all three histone marks,  becoming hypermethylated with loss of H3K4me3 or H3K27me3 and hypomethylated  with depletion of H2AK119ub, and many of these co-regulated loci were among  those commonly targeted for aberrant hypermethylation in cancer. Taken together,  our results elucidate novel roles for polycomb and MLL/COMPASS in regulating DNA  methylation and define targets of this regulation.', 'In contrast to normal cells, cancer cells exhibit both genetic and epigenetic  instability. These unique properties give rise to genetic and epigenetic  heterogeneity in a given population of cancer cells and provide a means for the  population to undergo phenotypic progression by clonal selection. DNA  methylation at CpG dinucleotides is one of the epigenetic marks that are  frequently disturbed in cancer cells. To understand how the CpG methylation  pattern is changeable in cancer cells, it is necessary to know how it is  faithfully maintained in normal cell proliferation. Toward this goal, we have  developed a novel in vitro system that is based on the well-established SV40 in  vitro replication system and functions to reconstitute concurrent DNA  replication and DNA maintenance methylation reactions. We found that DNA  methylation was maintained only when exogenous DNA methyltransferase 1 (DNMT1)  and S-adenosyl methionine (SAM) were added to the reaction. We demonstrated that  DNMT1 associates with replicating and/or replicated chromatin irrespective of  the DNA methylation status of template DNA. Moreover, the PCNA-binding domain  (PBD) of DNMT1 is not required for the association. Taken together, we suggest  that DNMT1 is recruited to replicating and/or replicated chromatin in a  constitutive manner independent of the DNA methylation reaction. The in vitro  system described in this report is very useful for analyzing the molecular  mechanism underlying the DNA maintenance methylation reaction.', 'Extensive changes in DNA methylation are common in cancer and may contribute to  oncogenesis through transcriptional silencing of tumor-suppressor genes.  Genome-scale studies have yielded important insights into these changes but have  focused on CpG islands or gene promoters. We used whole-genome bisulfite  sequencing (bisulfite-seq) to comprehensively profile a primary human colorectal  tumor and adjacent normal colon tissue at single-basepair resolution. Regions of  focal hypermethylation in the tumor were located primarily at CpG islands and  were concentrated within regions of long-range (>100 kb) hypomethylation. These  hypomethylated domains covered nearly half of the genome and coincided with late  replication and attachment to the nuclear lamina in human cell lines. We  confirmed the confluence of hypermethylation and hypomethylation within these  domains in 25 diverse colorectal tumors and matched adjacent tissue. We propose  that widespread DNA methylation changes in cancer are linked to silencing  programs orchestrated by the three-dimensional organization of chromatin within  the nucleus.', 'DNA methylation is a chemical modification of cytosine bases that is pivotal for  gene regulation, cellular specification and cancer development.

Thus, coordinating the status of H4K20 methylation is pivotal for the proper selection of DNA replication origins in higher eukaryotes. The methylation state of lysine 20 on histone H4 (H4K20) has been linked to chromatin compaction, transcription, DNA repair and DNA replication. Histone turnover is often associated with various histone modifications such as H3K56 acetylation (H3K56Ac), H3K36 methylation (H3K36me), and H4K20 methylation (H4K20me).

24,Between which types of DNA bases are mutational biases introduced due to directional mutation pressure?,"['Using a general form of the directional mutation theory, this paper analyzes the  effect of mutations in mutator genes on the G+C content of DNA, the frequency of  substitution mutations, and evolutionary changes (cumulative mutations) under  various degrees of selective constraints. Directional mutation theory predicts  that when the mutational bias between A/T and G/C nucleotide pairs is  equilibrated with the base composition of a neutral set of DNA nucleotides, the  mutation frequency per gene will be much lower than the frequency immediately  after the mutator mutation takes place. This prediction explains the wide  variation of the DNA G+C content among unicellular organisms and possibly also  the wide intragenomic heterogeneity of third codon positions for the genes of  multicellular eukaryotes. The present analyses lead to several predictions that  are not consistent with a number of the frequently held assumptions in the field  of molecular evolution, including belief in a constant rate of evolution,  symmetric branching of phylogenetic trees, the generality of higher mutation  frequency for neutral sets of nucleotides, the notion that mutator mutations are  generally deleterious because of their high mutation rates, and teleological  explanations of DNA base composition.', ""As a result of the nucleotide sequence analysis of an aphid endosymbiont's  operon homologous to the Escherichia coli groE, we noted that directional base  substitutions tending toward an increase of A + T content represent an obvious  evolutionary trend in this prokaryotic operon, housed for a long period by an  eukaryotic cell. This result, when taken together with previous reports, raised  the possibility that genomic DNA of prokaryotes residing in an eukaryotic cell  is subject to A/T-biased directional mutation pressure and/or both negative and  positive selection operating under conditions specific to the intracellular  environments."", 'Mutation is the engine that drives evolution and adaptation forward in that it  generates the variation on which natural selection acts. Mutation is a random  process that nevertheless occurs according to certain biases. Elucidating  mutational biases and the way they vary across species and within genomes is  crucial to understanding evolution and adaptation. Here we demonstrate that  clonal pathogens that evolve under severely relaxed selection are uniquely  suitable for studying mutational biases in bacteria. We estimate mutational  patterns using sequence datasets from five such clonal pathogens belonging to  four diverse bacterial clades that span most of the range of genomic nucleotide  content. We demonstrate that across different types of sites and in all four  clades mutation is consistently biased towards AT. This is true even in clades  that have high genomic GC content. In all studied cases the mutational bias  towards AT is primarily due to the high rate of C/G to T/A transitions. These  results suggest that bacterial mutational biases are far less variable than  previously thought. They further demonstrate that variation in nucleotide  content cannot stem entirely from variation in mutational biases and that  natural selection and/or a natural selection-like process such as biased gene  conversion strongly affect nucleotide content.', 'We present a new approach for analyzing directional mutation pressure and  nucleotide content in protein-coding genes. Directional mutation pressure, the  heterogenicity in the likelihood of different nucleotide substitutions, is used  to explain the increasing or decreasing guanine-cytosine content (GC%) in DNA  and is represented by microD, in agreement with Sueoka (1962, Proc Natl Acad Sci  USA 48:582-592). The new method uses simulation to facilitate identification of  significant A+T or G+C pressure as well as the comparison of directional  mutation pressure among genes, even when they are translated by different  genetic codes. We use the method to analyze the evolution of directional  mutation pressure and nucleotide content of mitochondrial cytochrome b genes.  Results from a survey of 110 taxa indicate that the cytochrome b genes of most  taxa are subjected to significant directional mutation pressure and that the  gene is subject to A+T pressure in most cases. Only in the anseriform bird  Cairina moschata is the cytochrome b gene subject to significant G+C pressure.  The GC% at nonsynonymous codon sites decreases proportionately with increasing  A+T pressure, and with a slope less than one, indicating a presence of selective  constraints. The cytochrome b genes of insects, nematodes, and eumycotes are  subject to extreme A+T pressures (microD = 0.123, 0.224, and 0.130) and, in  parallel, the GC% of the nonsynonymous codon sites has decreased from about 0.44  in organisms that are not subjected to A+T or G+C pressure to about 0.332,  0.323, and 0.367, respectively. The distribution of taxa according to the GC% at  nonsynonymous codon sites and directional mutation pressure supports the notion  that variation in these parameters is a phylogenetic component.', 'The prokaryotic genetic code has been influenced by directional mutation  pressure (GC/AT pressure) that has been exerted on the entire genome. This  pressure affects the synonymous codon choice, the amino acid composition of  proteins and tRNA anticodons. Unassigned codons would have been produced in  bacteria with extremely high GC or AT genomes by deleting certain codons and the  corresponding tRNAs. A high AT pressure together with genomic economization led  to a change in assignment of the UGA codon, from stop to tryptophan, in  Mycoplasma.', 'The genome of higher eukaryotes consists of genes having a widely heterogeneous  base composition at the third codon position. Ubiquitous variability of the DNA  base composition has the following two aspects: intragenomic heterogeneity of  the G+C content and the amino-acid-specific translation-coupled biases from the  Parity Rule 2 (PR2). PR2 is an intrastrand rule where A = T and G = C are  expected if there is no bias in mutation and selection between the two  complementary strands of DNA. To examine whether or not the biases from PR2 are  responsible for the wide heterogeneity of the DNA G+C content in human, the  third codon position of 846 human genes was analyzed. Genes were separated into  six groups according to their G+C content of the third codon position, and each  group was examined for the translation-coupled PR2 biases in the nucleotide  composition of the third codon position for two- and four-codon amino acids. The  results show that genes in the different G+C content groups have similar PR2  biases, indicating that the intragenomic heterogeneity of the G+C content is not  correlated with translation-coupled biases from the PR2. Therefore, the  heterogeneity of the G+C content is likely to be determined by some other  mechanism (e.g. locally variable directional mutation pressures) than  amino-acid-specific selections for the codon preference.', ""Somatic mutations within antibody genes alter the affinity and selectivity of  antibody molecules and largely define the quality of the memory B cell  repertoire in many vertebrate species. While some evidence supports the idea  that there is a strand bias to the hypermutation mechanism, conflicting data  suggest that somatic mutations are initially acquired on both strands of DNA. In  this study, we utilized a previously defined trinucleotide target bias of  hypermutation to address the question of target strand symmetry during mutation.  Mutabilities of specific base positions within all triplets were compared  between the two strands of DNA in three divergent databases of hypermutated  sequences. Unexpectedly, we consistently observed strong correlations between  mutabilities of triplet positions on the two DNA strands only for G and T in the  first position of a triplet or for C and A in the last position. The most  straightforward interpretation of this result is that the mutation mechanism  targets either G and T or C and A on both strands of DNA with a frequency that  depends upon the adjacent dinucleotide sequence. In view of published evidence  that C is targeted by the hypermutation mechanism, we can extrapolate that C and  A are specifically targeted at a frequency that depends upon the preceding 5'  dinucleotide."", 'Mutation is the engine that drives evolution and adaptation forward in that it  generates the variation on which natural selection acts. Mutation is a random  process that nevertheless occurs according to certain biases. Elucidating  mutational biases and the way they vary across species and within genomes is  crucial to understanding evolution and adaptation. Here we demonstrate that  clonal pathogens that evolve under severely relaxed selection are uniquely  suitable for studying mutational biases in bacteria. We estimate mutational  patterns using sequence datasets from five such clonal pathogens belonging to  four diverse bacterial clades that span most of the range of genomic nucleotide  content. We demonstrate that across different types of sites and in all four  clades mutation is consistently biased towards AT. This is true even in clades  that have high genomic GC content. In all studied cases the mutational bias  towards AT is primarily due to the high rate of C/G to T/A transitions. These  results suggest that bacterial mutational biases are far less variable than  previously thought. They further demonstrate that variation in nucleotide  content cannot stem entirely from variation in mutational biases and that  natural selection and/or a natural selection-like process such as biased gene  conversion strongly affect nucleotide content.', 'Regions of the genome that have been the target of positive selection  specifically along the human lineage are of special importance in human biology.  We used high throughput sequencing combined with methods to enrich human genomic  samples for particular targets to obtain the sequence of 22 chromosomal samples  at high depth in 40 kb neighborhoods of 49 previously identified 100-400 bp  elements that show evidence for human accelerated evolution. In addition to  selection, the pattern of nucleotide substitutions in several of these elements  suggested an historical bias favoring the conversion of weak (A or T) alleles  into strong (G or C) alleles. Here we found strong evidence in the derived  allele frequency spectra of many of these 40 kb regions for ongoing  weak-to-strong fixation bias. Comparison of the nucleotide composition at  polymorphic loci to the composition at sites of fixed substitutions additionally  reveals the signature of historical weak-to-strong fixation bias in a subset of  these regions. Most of the regions with evidence for historical bias do not also  have signatures of ongoing bias, suggesting that the evolutionary forces  generating weak-to-strong bias are not constant over time. To investigate the  role of selection in shaping these regions, we analyzed the spatial pattern of  polymorphism in our samples. We found no significant evidence for selective  sweeps, possibly because the signal of such sweeps has decayed beyond the power  of our tests to detect them. Together, these results do not rule out functional  roles for the observed changes in these regions-indeed there is good evidence  that the first two are functional elements in humans-but they suggest that a  fixation process (such as biased gene conversion) that is biased at the  nucleotide level, but is otherwise selectively neutral, could be an important  evolutionary force at play in them, both historically and at present.', 'Despite being generally under-represented in the genome, CpG sequences represent  a disproportionately high fraction of sites involved in mutational events  leading to human genetic disease. Cytosine within CpG dinucleotides is often  modified to 5-methylcytosine. Deamination of 5-methylcytosine in situ yields a  thymine, which being mispaired with guanine, is potentially mutagenic. Previous  reports have indicated that most mutations recovered at these sites appear to  originate on the non-transcribed strand as C-->T transitions. This trend may  however, reflect the lack of detectable mutant phenotypes resulting from this  transition at the complementary positions on the transcribed strand. To date,  there has not been a good model system in which mutations can be recovered on  both strands at the same CpG site. The human hprt gene has MeCpG sites contained  within arginine codons for which mutations have been recovered on both strands.  From an analysis of a database of hprt mutations, a statistically significant  strand bias is observed in mutations recovered at CpG sites. We describe some  models for the bias of mutation distribution observed at MeCpG sites in light of  this and previous work are described.']","The rates of substitution mutations in two directions, v (from an AT-pair to a GC-pair) and u (from a GC-pair to an AT-pair), are usually not the same. Thereafter, the effect of mutation on a genome is not random but has a directionality toward higher or lower GC content of DNA. The net effect, v/(u + v), has previously been defined as directional mutation pressure. Thus, directional mutation pressure (GC/AT pressure) refers to mutational biases between alpha-bases (A or T) and gamma-bases (G or C)."
25,Which genes are associated with autosomal dominant Charcot-Marie-Tooth?,"['Mutations in the ganglioside-induced-differentiation-associated protein 1 gene  (GDAP1) can cause Charcot-Marie-Tooth (CMT) disease with demyelinating (CMT4A)  or axonal forms (CMT2K and ARCMT2K). Most of these mutations present a recessive  inheritance, but few autosomal dominant GDAP1 mutations have also been reported.  We performed a GDAP1 gene screening in a clinically well-characterized series of  81 index cases with axonal CMT neuropathy, identifying 17 patients belonging to  4 unrelated families in whom the heterozygous p.R120W was found to be the only  disease-causing mutation. The main objective was to fully characterize the  neuropathy caused by this mutation. The clinical picture included a  mild-moderate phenotype with onset around adolescence, but great variability.  Consistently, ankle dorsiflexion and plantar flexion were impaired to a similar  degree. Nerve conduction studies revealed an axonal neuropathy. Muscle magnetic  resonance imaging studies demonstrated selective involvement of intrinsic foot  muscles in all patients and a uniform pattern of fatty infiltration in the calf,  with distal and superficial posterior predominance. Pathological abnormalities  included depletion of myelinated fibers, regenerative clusters and features of  axonal degeneration with mitochondrial aggregates. Our findings highlight the  relevance of dominantly transmitted p.R120W GDAP1 gene mutations which can cause  an axonal CMT with a wide clinical profile.', 'BACKGROUND: The first locus for demyelinating autosomal recessive  Charcot-Marie-Tooth (ARCMT) disease was identified in 8q13, where mutations in  GDAP1 have been found. Mutations in the same gene have been detected in families  with axonal ARCMT disease. OBJECTIVE: To determine the clinical, electrophysiologic, and morphologic  characteristics of a consanguineous Moroccan family with ARCMT disease  associated with the S194X mutation in the GDAP1 gene. METHODS: Four patients from a consanguineous Moroccan family were examined  clinically and electrophysiologically. In one patient, a morphometric and  ultrastructural study of a peroneal nerve biopsy sample was performed. Mutation  in the coding region of the GDAP1 gene was identified by direct sequencing. RESULTS: Neuropathy was evident early in childhood, walking was delayed in one  patient, and onset of symptoms occurred before 18 months in the others. The  phenotype was severe: foot deformities and disabilities involving the hands and  feet developed toward the end of the first decade, followed by involvement of  proximal muscles in the lower limbs, leading to loss of autonomy.  Electrophysiologic findings were consistent with an axonal form of CMT disease:  motor nerve conduction velocities, recordable in one patient only, were greater  than 40 m/sec. Sensory nerve action potentials were either abolished or  substantially reduced in amplitude. The morphologic data supported the diagnosis  of axonal neuropathy, showing a marked reduction in myelinated fibers and signs  of axonal regeneration, including frequent pseudo-onion bulb formations. The 4  patients in this family were homozygous for the S194X mutation in the GDAP1  gene. CONCLUSION: Electrophysiologic and pathological findings support the hypothesis  of an axonal disorder in this ARCMT family with the S194X mutation in the GDAP1  gene.', 'Charcot-Marie-Tooth (CMT) disease caused by mutations in the GDAP1 gene has been  shown to be inherited via traits that may be either autosomal recessive (in the  majority of cases) [CMT4A] or autosomal dominant [CMT2K]. CMT4A disease is  characterized by an early onset, and a severe clinical course often leading to a  loss of ambulation, whereas CMT2K is characterized by a mild clinical course of  benign axonal neuropathy beginning even in the 6th decade of life. Clinical data  from a GDAP1 mutated patient suggests that the presence of a particular mutation  is associated with a certain trait of inheritance. The association of a  particular GDAP1 gene mutation and a dominant or recessive trait of inheritance  is of special importance for genetic counseling and the prenatal diagnostics as  regards severe forms of CMT. In the present study we report on two CMT families  in which a newly identified Glu222Lys mutation within the GDAP1 gene segregates  both in autosomal dominant and recessive traits. Our study shows that at least  some GDAP1 gene mutations may segregate with the CMT phenotype as both dominant  and recessive traits. Thus, genetic counseling for CMT4A/CMT2K families requires  more extensive data on GDAP1 phenotype-genotype correlations.', 'Neurofilament light chain polypeptide (NEFL) is one of the most abundant  cytoskeletal components of the neuron. Mutations in the NEFL gene were recently  reported as a cause for autosomal dominant Charcot-Marie-Tooth type 2E (CMT2E)  linked to chromosome 8p21. In order to investigate the frequency and phenotypic  consequences of NEFL mutations, we screened 323 patients with CMT or related  peripheral neuropathies. We detected six disease associated missense mutations  and one 3-bp in-frame deletion clustered in functionally defined domains of the  NEFL protein. Patients have an early onset and often a severe clinical  phenotype. Electrophysiological examination shows moderately to severely slowed  nerve conduction velocities. We report the first nerve biopsy of a CMT patient  with a de novo missense mutation in NEFL, and found an axonal pathology with  axonal regeneration clusters and onion bulb formations. Our findings provide  further evidence that the clinical variation observed in CMT depends on the gene  mutated and the specific type of mutation, and we also suggest that NEFL  mutations need to be considered in the molecular evaluation of patients with  sporadic or dominantly inherited CMT.', 'BACKGROUND: Charcot-Marie-Tooth (CMT) neuropathy is a heterogeneous group of  inherited disorders of the peripheral nervous system. The authors recently  mapped an autosomal dominant demyelinating form of CMT type 1 (CMT1C) to  chromosome 16p13.1-p12.3. OBJECTIVE: To find the gene mutations underlying CMT1C. METHODS: The authors used a combination of standard positional cloning and  candidate gene approaches to identify the causal gene for CMT1C. Western blot  analysis was used to determine relative protein levels in patient and control  lymphocyte extracts. Northern blotting was used to characterize gene expression  in 1) multiple tissues; 2) developing sciatic nerve; and 3) nerve-crush and  nerve-transection experiments. RESULTS: The authors identified missense mutations (G112S, T115N, W116G) in the  LITAFgene (lipopolysaccharide-induced tumor necrosis factor-alpha factor) in  three CMT1C pedigrees. LITAF, which is also referred to as SIMPLE, is a widely  expressed gene encoding a 161-amino acid protein that may play a role in protein  degradation pathways. The mutations associated with CMT1C were found to cluster,  defining a domain of the LITAF protein having a critical role in peripheral  nerve function. Western blot analysis suggested that the T115N and W116G  mutations do not alter the level of LITAF protein in peripheral blood  lymphocytes. The LITAF transcript is expressed in sciatic nerve, but its level  of expression is not altered during development or in response to nerve injury.  This finding is in stark contrast to that seen for other known genes that cause  CMT1. CONCLUSIONS: Mutations in LITAF may account for a significant proportion of CMT1  patients with previously unknown molecular diagnosis and may define a new  mechanism of peripheral nerve perturbation leading to demyelinating neuropathy.', 'BACKGROUND: Recently, mutations affecting different domains of dynamin-2 (DNM2)  were associated alternatively with autosomal dominant centronuclear myopathy or  dominant intermediate (demyelinating and axonal) Charcot-Marie-Tooth disease  (CMT) type B. OBJECTIVE: To assess the etiologic role of DNM2 in CMT. METHODS: We performed a mutational screening of DNM2 exons 13 through 16  encoding the pleckstrin homology domain in a large series of CMT patients with a  broad range of nerve conduction velocities and without mutations in more common  genes. RESULTS: We identified two novel DNM2 mutations that cosegregated with purely  axonal CMT in two pedigrees without clinical evidence of primary myopathy. CONCLUSION: Patients with axonal Charcot-Marie-Tooth disease type 2 neuropathy  without mutations in more common genes should undergo investigation for DNM2  pleckstrin homology.', 'Charcot-Marie-Tooth (CMT) diseases include a group of clinically heterogeneous  inherited neuropathies subdivided into demyelinating (CMT1), axonal (CMT2) and  intermediate CMT forms. CMTs are associated with different genes, although  mutations in some of these genes may cause both clinical pictures. To date, more  than 50 CMT genes have been identified, but more than half of the cases are due  to mutations in MFN2, MPZ, GJB1 and PMP22. The aim of this study was to estimate  the frequency of disease mutations\xa0of these four genes in the axonal form of CMT  in order to evaluate their effectiveness in the molecular diagnosis of CMT2  patients. A cohort of 38 CMT2 Italian subjects was screened for mutations in the  MFN2, MPZ and GJB1 genes by direct sequencing and for PMP22 rearrangements using  the MLPA technique. Overall, we identified 15 mutations, 8 of which were novel:  11 mutations (28.9\xa0%) were in the MFN2 gene, 2 (5.3\xa0%) in MPZ and 2 (5.3\xa0%) in  PMP22. No mutations were found in GJB1. Two patients showed rearrangements in  the PMP22 gene, which is commonly associated with CMT1 or HNPP phenotypes thus  usually not tested in CMT2 patients. By including this gene in the analysis, we  reached a molecular diagnosis rate of 39.5\xa0%, which is one of the highest  reported in the literature. Our findings confirm the MFN2 gene as the most  common cause of CMT2 and suggest that PMP22 rearrangements should be considered  in the molecular diagnosis of CMT2 patients.', 'Autosomal dominant Charcot-Marie-Tooth type-1A neuropathy (CMT1A) is a  demyelinating peripheral nerve disorder that is commonly associated with a  submicroscopic tandem DNA duplication of a 1.5-Mb region of 17p11.2p12 that  contains the peripheral myelin gene PMP22. Clinical features of CMT1A include  progressive distal muscle atrophy and weakness, foot and hand deformities, gait  abnormalities, absent reflexes, and the completely penetrant electrophysiologic  phenotype of symmetric reductions in motor nerve conduction velocities (NCVs).  Molecular and fluorescense in situ hybridization (FISH) analyses were performed  to determine the duplication status of the PMP22 gene in four patients with rare  cytogenetic duplications of 17p. Neuropathologic features of CMT1A were seen in  two of these four patients, in addition to the complex phenotype asociated with  17p partial trisomy. Our findings show that the CMT1A phenotype of reduced NCV  is specifically associated with PMP22 gene duplications, thus providing further  support for the PMP22 gene dosage mechanism for CMT1A.', ""The objective of this study is to assess the genetic distribution of  Charcot-Marie-Tooth (CMT) disease in Campania, a region of Southern Italy. We  analyzed a cohort of 197 index cases and reported the type and frequency of  mutations for the whole CMT population and for each electrophysiological group  (CMT1, CMT2, and hereditary neuropathy with susceptibility to pressure palsies  [HNPP]) and for familial and isolated CMT cases. Genetic diagnosis was achieved  in 148 patients (75.1%) with a higher success rate in HNPP and CMT1 than CMT2.  Only four genes (PMP22, GJB1, MPZ, and GDAP1) accounted for 92% of all  genetically confirmed CMT cases. In CMT1, PMP22 duplication was the most common  mutation while the second gene in order of frequency was MPZ in familial and  SH3TC2 in isolated cases. In CMT2, GJB1 was the most frequent mutated gene and  GJB1 with GDAP1 accounted for almost 3/4 of genetically defined CMT2 patients.  The first gene in order of frequency was GJB1 in familial and GDAP1 in isolated  cases. In HNPP, the majority of patients harbored the PMP22 gene deletion. The  novelty of our data is the relatively high frequency of SH3TC2 and GDAP1  mutations in demyelinating and axonal forms, respectively. These epidemiological  data can help in panel design for our patients' population."", 'Dominant intermediate Charcot-Marie-Tooth neuropathy type B is caused by  mutations in dynamin 2. We studied the clinical, haematological,  electrophysiological and sural nerve biopsy findings in 34 patients belonging to  six unrelated dominant intermediate Charcot-Marie-Tooth neuropathy type B  families in whom a dynamin 2 mutation had been identified: Gly358Arg (Spain);  Asp551_Glu553del; Lys550fs (North America); Lys558del (Belgium); Lys558Glu  (Australia, the Netherlands) and Thr855_Ile856del (Belgium). The Gly358Arg and  Thr855_Ile856del mutations were novel, and in contrast to the other  Charcot-Marie-Tooth-related mutations in dynamin 2, which are all located in the  pleckstrin homology domain, they were situated in the middle domain and  proline-rich domain of dynamin 2, respectively. We report the first  disease-causing mutation in the proline-rich domain of dynamin 2. Patients with  a dynamin 2 mutation presented with a classical Charcot-Marie-Tooth phenotype,  which was mild to moderately severe since only 3% of the patients were  wheelchair-bound. The mean age at onset was 16 years with a large variability  ranging from 2 to 50 years. Interestingly, in the Australian and Belgian  families, which carry two different mutations affecting the same amino acid  (Lys558), Charcot-Marie-Tooth cosegregated with neutropaenia. In addition, early  onset cataracts were observed in one of the Charcot-Marie-Tooth families. Our  electrophysiological data indicate intermediate or axonal motor median nerve  conduction velocities (NCV) ranging from 26 m/s to normal values in four  families, and less pronounced reduction of motor median NCV (41-46 m/s) with  normal amplitudes in two families. Sural nerve biopsy in a Dutch patient with  Lys558Glu mutation showed diffuse loss of large myelinated fibres, presence of  many clusters of regenerating myelinated axons and fibres with focal myelin  thickenings--findings very similar to those previously reported in the  Australian family. We conclude that dynamin 2 mutations should be screened in  the autosomal dominant Charcot-Marie-Tooth neuropathy families with intermediate  or axonal NCV, and in patients with a classical mild to moderately severe  Charcot-Marie-Tooth phenotype, especially when Charcot-Marie-Tooth is associated  with neutropaenia or cataracts.']","The genes associated with the X-linked and the autosomal dominant forms of Charcot-Marie-Tooth disease are GJB1, MPZ, INF2, DNM2, YARS, GNB4, NEFL, MFN2, LRSAM1, GDAP1, PMP22, LITAF, and EGR2. Identification of these genes has not only been important for patients and families, but also provided new information about disease pathogenesis."
26,List components of the CRSP/Med complex.,"['Activation of gene transcription in mammalian cells requires several classes of  coactivators that participate in different steps of the activation cascade.  Using conventional and affinity chromatography, we have isolated a human  coactivator complex that interacts directly with the C-terminal domain (CTD) of  RNA polymerase II (Pol II). The CTD-binding complex is structurally and  functionally indistinguishable from our previously isolated CRSP coactivator  complex. The closely related, but transcriptionally inactive, ARC-L complex  failed to interact with the CTD, indicating a significant biochemical difference  between CRSP and ARC-L that may, in part, explain their functional divergence.  Electron microscopy and three-dimensional single-particle reconstruction reveals  a conformation for CTD-CRSP that is structurally distinct from unliganded CRSP  or CRSP bound to SREBP-1a, but highly similar to CRSP bound to the VP16  activator. Together, our findings suggest that the human CRSP coactivator  functions, at least in part, by mediating activator-dependent recruitment of RNA  Pol II via the CTD.', 'Human MED26 was originally purified in the cofactor required for the Sp1  activation complex (CRSP) as a 70-kDa component named CRSP70. This polypeptide  was specific to metazoans and the “small” form of the Mediator complex. We  report here that a Drosophila melanogaster homologue of MED26 similarly  interacts with other components of the core Drosophila Mediator complex but not  with the kinase module and is recruited to genes upon activation. Using a null  allele of Med26, we show that Med26 is required for organismal viability but not  for cell proliferation or survival. Clones lacking Med26 in the wing disc lead  to loss of the adult wing margin and reduced expression of genes involved in  wing margin formation. Surprisingly, when polytene chromosomes from the salivary  gland were examined using antibodies to Med26, it was apparent that a fraction  of the protein was associated with the chromocenter, which contains pericentric  heterochromatin. This staining colocalizes with heterochromatin protein 1 (HP1).  Immunoprecipitation experiments show that Med26 interacts with HP1. The  interaction is mediated through the chromoshadow domain of HP1 and through the  conserved motif in the carboxy terminus of the Med26 protein. This work is the  first characterization of the metazoan-specific Mediator subunit in an animal  model.', 'Activation of gene transcription in metazoans is a multistep process that is  triggered by factors that recognize transcriptional enhancer sites in DNA. These  factors work with co-activators to direct transcriptional initiation by the RNA  polymerase II apparatus. One class of co-activator, the TAF(II) subunits of  transcription factor TFIID, can serve as targets of activators and as proteins  that recognize core promoter sequences necessary for transcription initiation.  Transcriptional activation by enhancer-binding factors such as Sp1 requires  TFIID, but the identity of other necessary cofactors has remained unknown. Here  we describe a new human factor, CRSP, that is required together with the  TAF(II)s for transcriptional activation by Sp1. Purification of CRSP identifies  a complex of approximate relative molecular mass 700,000 (M(r) approximately  700K) that contains nine subunits with M(r) values ranging from 33K to 200K.  Cloning of genes encoding CRSP subunits reveals that CRSP33 is a homologue of  the yeast mediator subunit Med7, whereas CRSP150 contains a domain conserved in  yeast mediator subunit Rgr1. CRSP p200 is identical to the nuclear  hormone-receptor co-activator subunit TRIP2/PBP. CRSPs 34, 77 and 130 are new  proteins, but the amino terminus of CRSP70 is homologous to elongation factor  TFIIS. Immunodepletion studies confirm that these subunits have an essential  cofactor function. The presence of common subunits in distinct cofactor  complexes suggests a combinatorial mechanism of co-activator assembly during  transcriptional activation.', 'Transcription of protein coding genes in metazoans involves the concerted action  of enhancer binding proteins and the RNA polymerase II apparatus. The cross talk  between these two classes of transcription factors is mediated by an elaborate  set of cofactor complexes. For the activation of transcription by the promoter  specificity protein 1 (Sp1), TATA binding protein-associated factors in the  TFIID complex originally were identified as necessary coactivators, but the  identity of additional cofactors required for activated transcription was  unknown. Recently, we have reported the isolation and properties of a cofactor  complex, CRSP (cofactor required for Sp1), which functions in conjunction with  the TATA binding protein-associated factors to promote efficient activation of  transcription by Sp1. CRSP contains unique subunits as well as polypeptides that  are shared with other cofactor complexes. Here, we report a detailed  purification protocol for the isolation of CRSP from human HeLa cells. Our  purification strategy takes advantage of the ability of CRSP to bind  Ni2+-nitrilotriacetic acid-agarose resin as well as other conventional  chromatographic resins. We also describe a streamlined purification protocol  that allows a more rapid and efficient means to isolate active CRSP.', 'C/EBPbeta is an intrinsically repressed transcription factor that regulates  genes involved in differentiation, proliferation, tumorigenesis, and apoptosis.  C/EBPbeta acts as a repressor that is turned into an activator by the Ras  oncoprotein through phosphorylation of a MAPK site. C/EBPbeta activation is  accompanied by a conformational change. Active and repressive C/EBPbeta  interacts with multisubunit Mediator complexes through the CRSP130/Sur2 subunit.  The CRSP130/Sur2 subunit is common to two distinct types of Mediator complexes,  characterized by CRSP70 and CDK8 proteins as transcriptionally active and  inactive Mediator, respectively. Knockdown of CRSP130/Sur2 prevents Mediator  binding and transactivation through C/EBPbeta. Oncogenic Ras signaling or  activating mutations in C/EBPbeta selects the transcriptionally active Mediator  complex that also associates with RNA polymerase II. These results show that a  Ras-induced structural alteration of C/EBPbeta determines differential gene  activation through selective interaction with distinct Mediator complexes.', 'Author information: (1)The Center for Genome Architecture, Baylor College of Medicine, Houston, TX  77030, USA; Department of Molecular and Human Genetics, Baylor College of  Medicine, Houston, TX 77030, USA; Department of Computer Science, Department of  Computational and Applied Mathematics, Rice University, Houston, TX 77005, USA;  Broad Institute of MIT and Harvard, Cambridge, MA 02139, USA.

27,For the constructions of which organs has 3D printing been tested?,"['A multimaterial bio-ink method using polyethylene glycol crosslinking is  presented for expanding the biomaterial palette required for 3D bioprinting of  more mimetic and customizable tissue and organ constructs. Lightly crosslinked,  soft hydrogels are produced from precursor solutions of various materials and 3D  printed. Rheological and biological characterizations are presented, and the  promise of this new bio-ink synthesis strategy is discussed.', 'In the world, bone tuberculosis is still very difficult to treat and presents a  challenge to clinicians. In this study, we utilized 3D printing technology to  fabricate a programmed release multi-drug implant for bone tuberculosis therapy.  The construction of the drug implant was a multi-layered concentric cylinder  divided into four layers from the center to the periphery. Isoniazid and  rifampicin were distributed individually into the different layers in a specific  sequence of isoniazid-rifampicin-isoniazid-rifampicin. The drug release assays  in vitro and in vivo showed that isoniazid and rifampicin were released orderly  from the outside to the center to form the multi-drug therapeutic alliance, and  the peak concentrations of drugs were detected in sequence at 8 to 12 day  intervals. In addition, no negative effect on the proliferation of rabbit bone  marrow mesenchymal stem cells was detected during the cytocompatibility assay.  Due to its ideal pharmacologic action and cytocompatibility, the programmed  release multi-drug implant with a complex construction fabricated by 3D printing  technology could be of interest in prevention and treatment of bone  tuberculosis.', '3D printing is a method of manufacturing in which materials, such as plastic or  metal, are deposited onto one another in layers to produce a three dimensional  object, such as a pair of eye glasses or other 3D objects. This process  contrasts with traditional ink-based printers which produce a two dimensional  object (ink on paper). To date, 3D printing has primarily been used in  engineering to create engineering prototypes. However, recent advances in  printing materials have now enabled 3D printers to make objects that are  comparable with traditionally manufactured items. In contrast with conventional  printers, 3D printing has the potential to enable mass customisation of goods on  a large scale and has relevance in medicine including ophthalmology. 3D printing  has already been proved viable in several medical applications including the  manufacture of eyeglasses, custom prosthetic devices and dental implants. In  this review, we discuss the potential for 3D printing to revolutionise  manufacturing in the same way as the printing press revolutionised conventional  printing. The applications and limitations of 3D printing are discussed; the  production process is demonstrated by producing a set of eyeglass frames from 3D  blueprints.', 'The morphology and the functionality of the murid glandular complex, composed of  the submandibular and sublingual salivary glands (SSC), were the object of  several studies conducted mainly using magnetic resonance imaging (MRI). Using a  4.7 T scanner and a manganese-based contrast agent, we improved the  signal-to-noise ratio of the SSC relating to the surrounding anatomical  structures allowing to obtain high-contrast 3D images of the SSC. In the last  few years, the large development in resin melting techniques opened the way for  printing 3D objects starting from a 3D stack of images. Here, we demonstrate the  feasibility of the 3D printing technique of soft tissues such as the SSC in the  rat with the aim to improve the visualization of the organs. This approach is  useful to preserve the real in vivo morphology of the SCC in living animals  avoiding the anatomical shape changes due to the lack of relationships with the  surrounding organs in case of extraction. It is also harmless, repeatable and  can be applied to explore volumetric changes occurring during body growth,  excretory duct obstruction, tumorigenesis and regeneration processes. 3D  printing allows to obtain a solid object with the same shape of the organ of  interest, which can be observed, freely rotated and manipulated. To increase the  visibility of the details, it is possible to print the organs with a selected  zoom factor, useful as in case of tiny organs in small mammalia. An immediate  application of this technique is represented by educational classes.', 'Tissue engineering technology promises to solve the organ transplantation  crisis. However, assembly of vascularized 3D soft organs remains a big  challenge. Organ printing, which we define as computer-aided, jet-based 3D  tissue-engineering of living human organs, offers a possible solution. Organ  printing involves three sequential steps: pre-processing or development of  ""blueprints"" for organs; processing or actual organ printing; and postprocessing  or organ conditioning and accelerated organ maturation. A cell printer that can  print gels, single cells and cell aggregates has been developed. Layer-by-layer  sequentially placed and solidified thin layers of a thermo-reversible gel could  serve as ""printing paper"". Combination of an engineering approach with the  developmental biology concept of embryonic tissue fluidity enables the creation  of a new rapid prototyping 3D organ printing technology, which will dramatically  accelerate and optimize tissue and organ assembly.', 'The three-dimensional (3D) printer is a new technology that creates physical  objects from digital files. Recent technological advances in 3D printing have  resulted in increased use of this technology in the medical field, where it is  beginning to revolutionize medical and surgical possibilities. It is already  providing medicine with powerful tools that facilitate education, surgical  planning, and organ transplantation research. A good understanding of this  technology will be beneficial to ophthalmologists. The potential applications of  3D printing in ophthalmology, both current and future, are explored in this  article.', 'An additive manufacturing process that combines digital modeling and 3D printing  was used to prepare fiber reinforced hydrogels in a single-step process. The  composite materials were fabricated by selectively pattering a combination of  alginate/acrylamide gel precursor solution and an epoxy based UV-curable  adhesive (Emax 904 Gel-SC) with an extrusion printer. UV irradiation was used to  cure the two inks into a single composite material. Spatial control of fiber  distribution within the digital models allowed for the fabrication of a series  of materials with a spectrum of swelling behavior and mechanical properties with  physical characteristics ranging from soft and wet to hard and dry. A comparison  with the ""rule of mixtures"" was used to show that the swollen composite  materials adhere to standard composite theory. A prototype meniscus cartilage  was prepared to illustrate the potential application in bioengineering.', 'Tissue engineering has great potential to provide a functional de novo living  valve replacement, capable of integration with host tissue and growth. Among  various valve conduit fabrication techniques, three-dimensional (3-D)  bioprinting enables deposition of cells and hydrogels into 3-D constructs with  anatomical geometry and heterogeneous mechanical properties. Successful  translation of this approach, however, is constrained by the dearth of printable  and biocompatible hydrogel materials. Furthermore, it is not known how human  valve cells respond to these printed environments. In this study, 3-D printable  formulations of hybrid hydrogels are developed, based on methacrylated  hyaluronic acid (Me-HA) and methacrylated gelatin (Me-Gel), and used to bioprint  heart valve conduits containing encapsulated human aortic valvular interstitial  cells (HAVIC). Increasing Me-Gel concentration resulted in lower stiffness and  higher viscosity, facilitated cell spreading, and better maintained HAVIC  fibroblastic phenotype. Bioprinting accuracy was dependent upon the relative  concentrations of Me-Gel and Me-HA, but when optimized enabled the fabrication  of a trileaflet valve shape accurate to the original design. HAVIC encapsulated  within bioprinted heart valves maintained high viability, and remodeled the  initial matrix by depositing collagen and glyosaminoglycans. These findings  represent the first rational design of bioprinted trileaflet valve hydrogels  that regulate encapsulated human VIC behavior. The use of anatomically accurate  living valve scaffolds through bioprinting may accelerate understanding of  physiological valve cell interactions and progress towards de novo living valve  replacements.', 'Three-dimensional (3D) bioprinting, a flexible automated on-demand platform for  the free-form fabrication of complex living architectures, is a novel approach  for the design and engineering of human organs and tissues. Here, we demonstrate  the potential of 3D bioprinting for tissue engineering using human skin as a  prototypical example. Keratinocytes and fibroblasts were used as constituent  cells to represent the epidermis and dermis, and collagen was used to represent  the dermal matrix of the skin. Preliminary studies were conducted to optimize  printing parameters for maximum cell viability as well as for the optimization  of cell densities in the epidermis and dermis to mimic physiologically relevant  attributes of human skin. Printed 3D constructs were cultured in submerged media  conditions followed by exposure of the epidermal layer to the air-liquid  interface to promote maturation and stratification. Histology and  immunofluorescence characterization demonstrated that 3D printed skin tissue was  morphologically and biologically representative of in vivo human skin tissue. In  comparison with traditional methods for skin engineering, 3D bioprinting offers  several advantages in terms of shape- and form retention, flexibility,  reproducibility, and high culture throughput. It has a broad range of  applications in transdermal and topical formulation discovery, dermal toxicity  studies, and in designing autologous grafts for wound healing. The  proof-of-concept studies presented here can be further extended for enhancing  the complexity of the skin model via the incorporation of secondary and adnexal  structures or the inclusion of diseased cells to serve as a model for studying  the pathophysiology of skin diseases.', 'Cardiovascular diseases are the leading cause of deaths throughout the world.  Vascular diseases are mostly treated with autografts and blood vessel  transplantations. However, traditional grafting methods have several problems  including lack of suitable harvest sites, additional surgical costs for  harvesting procedure, pain, infection, lack of donors, and even no substitutes  at all. Recently, tissue engineering and regenerative medicine approaches are  used to regenerate damaged or diseased tissues. Most of the tissue engineering  investigations have been based on the cell seeding into scaffolds by providing a  suitable environment for cell attachment, proliferation, and differentiation.  Because of the challenges such as difficulties in seeding cells spatially,  rejection, and inflammation of biomaterials used, the recent tissue engineering  studies focus on scaffold-free techniques. In this paper, the development of  novel computer aided algorithms and methods are developed for 3D bioprinting of  scaffold-free biomimetic macrovascular structures. Computer model mimicking a  real human aorta is generated using imaging techniques and the proposed  computational algorithms. An optimized three-dimensional bioprinting path  planning are developed with the proposed self-supported model. Mouse embryonic  fibroblast (MEF) cell aggregates and support structures (hydrogels) are 3D  bioprinted layer-by-layer according to the proposed self-supported method to  form an aortic tissue construct.']","Nose, ear and meniscus prototypes/constructs have been produced with 3D (3-dimesional) printing."
28,Which gene is the paralog of yeast UPC2?,"['Wild-type yeast cells are unable to take up sterols from their growth media  under aerobic conditions and are relatively resistant to monovalent cations. A  yeast mutant (upc2-1) with a defect in the aerobic exclusion of sterols was  found to have increased sensitivity to LiCl and NaCl. Although cation  sensitivity has been reported for mutants that synthesize altered sterols, the  mutant with upc2-1 continues to produce the normal sterol, ergosterol. The ENA2  gene was cloned on the basis of remediating the hypersensitivity to the  monovalent cations.', 'Saccharomyces cerevisiae ergosterol biosynthesis, like cholesterol biosynthesis  in mammals, is regulated at the transcriptional level by a sterol feedback  mechanism. Yeast studies defined a 7-bp consensus sterol-response element (SRE)  common to genes involved in sterol biosynthesis and two transcription factors,  Upc2 and Ecm22, which direct transcription of sterol biosynthetic genes. The  7-bp consensus SRE is identical to the anaerobic response element, AR1c. Data  indicate that Upc2 and Ecm22 function through binding to this SRE site. We now  show that it is two novel anaerobic AR1b elements in the UPC2 promoter that  direct global ERG gene expression in response to a block in de novo ergosterol  biosynthesis, brought about by antifungal drug treatment. The AR1b elements are  absolutely required for auto-induction of UPC2 gene expression and protein and  require Upc2 and Ecm22 for function. We further demonstrate the direct binding  of recombinant expressed S. cerevisiae ScUpc2 and pathogenic Candida albicans  CaUpc2 and Candida glabrata CgUpc2 to AR1b and SRE/AR1c elements. Recombinant  endogenous promoter studies show that the UPC2 anaerobic AR1b elements act in  trans to regulate ergosterol gene expression. Our results indicate that Upc2  must occupy UPC2 AR1b elements in order for ERG gene expression induction to  take place. Thus, the two UPC2-AR1b elements drive expression of all ERG genes  necessary for maintaining normal antifungal susceptibility, as wild type cells  lacking these elements have increased susceptibility to azole antifungal drugs.  Therefore, targeting these specific sites for antifungal therapy represents a  novel approach to treat systemic fungal infections.', 'The transition between a unicellular yeast form to multicellular filaments is  crucial for budding yeast foraging and the pathogenesis of many fungal pathogens  such as Candida albicans. Here, we examine the role of the related transcription  factors Ecm22 and Upc2 in Saccharomyces cerevisiae filamentation. Overexpression  of either ECM22 or UPC2 leads to increased filamentation, whereas cells lacking  both ECM22 and UPC2 do not exhibit filamentous growth. Ecm22 and Upc2 positively  control the expression of FHN1, NPR1, PRR2 and sterol biosynthesis genes. These  genes all play a positive role in filamentous growth, and their expression is  upregulated during filamentation in an Ecm22/Upc2-dependent manner. Furthermore,  ergosterol content increases during filamentous growth. UPC2 expression also  increases during filamentation and is inhibited by the transcription factors  Sut1 and Sut2. The expression of SUT1 and SUT2 in turn is under negative control  of the transcription factor Ste12. We suggest that during filamentation Ste12  becomes activated and reduces SUT1/SUT2 expression levels. This would result in  increased UPC2 levels and as a consequence to transcriptional activation of  FHN1, NPR1, PRR2 and sterol biosynthesis genes. Higher ergosterol levels in  combination with the proteins Fhn1, Npr1 and Prr2 would then mediate the  transition to filamentous growth.', 'Saccharomyces cerevisiae normally will not take up sterols from the environment  under aerobic conditions. A specific mutant, upc2-1, of the predicted  transcriptional activator UPC2 (YDR213w) has been recognized as a strain that  allows a high level of aerobic sterol uptake. Another predicted transcriptional  activator, the YLR228c gene product, is highly homologous to Upc2p. In fact, at  the carboxy terminus 130 of the last 139 amino acids are similar between the two  proteins. Since these proteins are very similar, the effect of mutations in the  YLR228c open reading frame (ORF) was compared with like alterations in UPC2.  First, the YLR228c ORF was insertionally inactivated and crossed with various  UPC2 constructs. Deletion of YLR228c and UPC2 in combination resulted in  nonviability, suggesting that the two proteins have some essential overlapping  function. The upc2-1 point mutation responsible for aerobic sterol uptake was  duplicated in the homologous carboxy region of the YLR228c ORF using  site-directed mutagenesis. This mutation on a high-copy vector resulted in an  increase in sterol uptake compared to an isogenic wild-type strain. The  combination of both point mutations resulted in the greatest level of aerobic  sterol uptake. When the YLR228c point mutation was expressed from a low-copy  vector there was little if any effect on sterol uptake. Gas chromatographic  analysis of the nonsaponifiable fractions of the various strains showed that the  major sterol for all YLR228c and UPC2 combinations was ergosterol, the consensus  yeast sterol.', 'Zinc cluster proteins are a large family of transcriptional regulators with a  wide range of biological functions. The zinc cluster proteins Ecm22, Upc2, Sut1  and Sut2 have initially been identified as regulators of sterol import in the  budding yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae. These proteins also control adaptations  to anaerobic growth, sterol biosynthesis as well as filamentation and mating.  Orthologs of these zinc cluster proteins have been identified in several species  of Candida. Upc2 plays a critical role in antifungal resistance in these  important human fungal pathogens. Upc2 is therefore an interesting potential  target for novel antifungals. In this review we discuss the functions, mode of  actions and regulation of Ecm22, Upc2, Sut1 and Sut2 in budding yeast and  Candida.', ""Gene redundancy has been observed in yeast, plant and human genomes, and is  thought to be a consequence of whole-genome duplications. Baker's yeast,  Saccharomyces cerevisiae, contains several hundred duplicated genes.  Duplication(s) could have occurred before or after a given speciation. To  understand the evolution of the yeast genome, we analysed orthologues of some of  these genes in several related yeast species. On the basis of the inferred  phylogeny of each set of genes, we were able to deduce whether the gene  duplicated and/or specialized before or after the divergence of two yeast  lineages. Here we show that the gene duplications might have occurred as a  single event, and that it probably took place before the Saccharomyces and  Kluyveromyces lineages diverged from each other. Further evolution of each  duplicated gene pair-such as specialization or differentiation of the two  copies, or deletion of a single copy--has taken place independently throughout  the evolution of these species."", 'The concept of protein function is widely used and manipulated by biologists.  However, the means of the concept and its understanding may vary depending on  the level of functionality one considers (molecular, cellular, physiological,  etc.). Genomic studies and new high-throughput methods of the post-genomic era  provide the opportunity to shed a new light on the concept of protein function:  protein-protein interactions can now be considered as pieces of incomplete but  still gigantic networks and the analysis of these networks will permit the  emergence of a more integrated view of protein function. In this context, we  propose a new functional classification method, which, unlike usual methods  based on sequence homology, allows the definition of functional classes of  protein based on the identity of their interacting partners. An example of such  classification will be shown and discussed for a subset of Saccharomyces  cerevisiae proteins, accounting for 7% of the yeast proteome. The genome of the  budding yeast contains 50% of protein-coding genes that are paralogs, including  457 pairs of duplicated genes coming probably from an ancient whole genome  duplication. We will comment on the functional classification of the duplicated  genes when using our method and discuss the contribution of these results to the  understanding of function evolution for the duplicated genes.', 'In addition to their well-documented roles in the promotion of nonsense-mediated  mRNA decay (NMD), yeast Upf proteins (Upf1, Upf2/Nmd2, and Upf3) also manifest  translational regulatory functions, at least in vitro, including roles in  premature translation termination and subsequent reinitiation. Here, we find  that all upf Delta strains also fail to reinitiate translation after  encountering a premature termination codon (PTC) in vivo, a result that led us  to seek a unifying mechanism for all of these translation phenomena. Comparisons  of the in vitro translational activities of wild-type (WT) and upf1 Delta  extracts were utilized to test for a Upf1 role in post-termination ribosome  reutilization. Relative to WT extracts, non-nucleased extracts lacking Upf1 had  approximately twofold decreased activity for the translation of synthetic  CAN1/LUC mRNA, a defect paralleled by fewer ribosomes per mRNA and reduced  efficiency of the 60S joining step at initiation. These deficiencies could be  complemented by purified FLAG-Upf1, or 60S subunits, and appeared to reflect  diminished cycling of ribosomes from endogenous PTC-containing mRNAs to  exogenously added synthetic mRNA in the same extracts. This hypothesis was  tested, and supported, by experiments in which nucleased WT or upf1 Delta  extracts were first challenged with high concentrations of synthetic mRNAs that  were templates for either normal or premature translation termination and then  assayed for their capacity to translate a normal mRNA. Our results indicate that  Upf1 plays a key role in a mechanism coupling termination and ribosome release  at a PTC to subsequent ribosome reutilization for another round of translation  initiation.', 'BACKGROUND: Ubiquilins are proteins that function as ubiquitin receptors in  eukaryotes. Mutations in two ubiquilin-encoding genes have been linked to the  genesis of neurodegenerative diseases. However, ubiquilin functions are still  poorly understood. RESULTS: In this study, evolutionary and functional data are combined to  determine the origin and diversification of the ubiquilin gene family and to  characterize novel potential roles of ubiquilins in mammalian species, including  humans. The analysis of more than six hundred sequences allowed characterizing  ubiquilin diversity in all the main eukaryotic groups. Many organisms (e. g.  fungi, many animals) have single ubiquilin genes, but duplications in animal,  plant, alveolate and excavate species are described. Seven different ubiquilins  have been detected in vertebrates. Two of them, here called UBQLN5 and UBQLN6,  had not been hitherto described. Significantly, marsupial and eutherian mammals  have the most complex ubiquilin gene families, composed of up to 6 genes. This  exceptional mammalian-specific expansion is the result of the recent emergence  of four new genes, three of them (UBQLN3, UBQLN5 and UBQLNL) with precise  testis-specific expression patterns that indicate roles in the postmeiotic  stages of spermatogenesis. A gene with related features has independently arisen  in species of the Drosophila genus. Positive selection acting on some mammalian  ubiquilins has been detected. CONCLUSIONS: The ubiquilin gene family is highly conserved in eukaryotes. The  infrequent lineage-specific amplifications observed may be linked to the  emergence of novel functions in particular tissues.', 'Gene duplications have been broadly implicated in the generation of  testis-specific genes. To perform a comprehensive analysis of paralogous  testis-biased genes, we characterized the testes transcriptome of Drosophila  melanogaster by comparing gene expression in testes vs. ovaries, heads, and  gonadectomized males. A number of the identified 399 testis-biased genes code  for the known components of mature sperm. Among the detected 69 genes  downregulated in testes, a large fraction is required for viability. By  analyzing paralogs of testis-biased genes, we identified ""co-regulated""  paralogous pairs in which both genes are testis biased, ""anti-regulated"" pairs  in which one paralog is testis biased and the other downregulated in testes, and  ""neutral"" pairs in which one paralog is testis biased and the other  constitutively expressed. The numbers of identified co-regulated and  anti-regulated pairs were higher than expected by chance. Testis-biased genes  included in these pairs show decreased frequency of lethal mutations, suggesting  their specific role in male reproduction. These genes also show exceptionally  high interspecific variability of expression in comparison between D.  melanogaster and the closely related D. simulans. Further, interspecific changes  in testis bias of expression are generally correlated within the co-regulated  pairs and are anti-correlated within the anti-regulated pairs, suggesting  coordinated regulation within both types of paralogous gene pairs.']",the related transcription factors Ecm22 and Upc2 play a crucial role in Saccharomyces cerevisiae filamentation.
29,Which disease can be treated with Relugolix.,"['Results from the phase 3 HERO trial(NCT03085095), presented during the 2020  American Society of Clinical Oncology Virtual Scientific Program, indicated that  relugolix (Relumina) demonstrated superiority over leuprolide (Lupron) in  sustained testosterone suppression through 48 weeks, fast testosterone recovery  after discontinuation, and a 50% reduction in major adverse cardiovascular  events (MACE) in patients with advanced prostate cancer.', 'BACKGROUND: Injectable luteinizing hormone-releasing hormone agonists (e.g.,  leuprolide) are the standard agents for achieving androgen deprivation for  prostate cancer despite the initial testosterone surge and delay in therapeutic  effect. The efficacy and safety of relugolix, an oral gonadotropin-releasing  hormone antagonist, as compared with those of leuprolide are not known. METHODS: In this phase 3 trial, we randomly assigned patients with advanced  prostate cancer, in a 2:1 ratio, to receive relugolix (120 mg orally once daily)  or leuprolide (injections every 3 months) for 48 weeks. The primary end point  was sustained testosterone suppression to castrate levels (<50 ng per deciliter)  through 48 weeks. Secondary end points included noninferiority with respect to  the primary end point, castrate levels of testosterone on day 4, and profound  castrate levels (<20 ng per deciliter) on day 15. Testosterone recovery was  evaluated in a subgroup of patients. RESULTS: A total of 622 patients received relugolix and 308 received leuprolide.  Of men who received relugolix, 96.7% (95% confidence interval [CI], 94.9 to  97.9) maintained castration through 48 weeks, as compared with 88.8% (95% CI,  84.6 to 91.8) of men receiving leuprolide. The difference of 7.9 percentage  points (95% CI, 4.1 to 11.8) showed noninferiority and superiority of relugolix  (P<0.001 for superiority). All other key secondary end points showed superiority  of relugolix over leuprolide (P<0.001). The percentage of patients with castrate  levels of testosterone on day 4 was 56.0% with relugolix and 0% with leuprolide.  In the subgroup of 184 patients followed for testosterone recovery, the mean  testosterone levels 90 days after treatment discontinuation were 288.4 ng per  deciliter in the relugolix group and 58.6 ng per deciliter in the leuprolide  group. Among all the patients, the incidence of major adverse cardiovascular  events was 2.9% in the relugolix group and 6.2% in the leuprolide group (hazard  ratio, 0.46; 95% CI, 0.24 to 0.88). CONCLUSIONS: In this trial involving men with advanced prostate cancer,  relugolix achieved rapid, sustained suppression of testosterone levels that was  superior to that with leuprolide, with a 54% lower risk of major adverse  cardiovascular events.

METHODS: In a double-blind, double-dummy trial, premenopausal women with uterine  leiomyomas and heavy menstrual bleeding defined as a pictorial blood loss  assessment chart score of at least 120 were randomized in a 1:1 ratio to  relugolix (40 mg, oral, once daily) or leuprorelin acetate (1.88 mg or 3.75 mg,  monthly injection) for 24 weeks. The primary endpoint was the proportion of  patients with a total pictorial blood loss assessment chart score of less than  10 for weeks 6-12. Secondary endpoints included myoma and uterine volumes, and  hemoglobin levels. A sample size of 144 patients per group (n=288) was estimated  to provide at least 90% power to demonstrate noninferiority (prespecified  noninferiority margin -15%; one-sided 0.025 level of significance). RESULTS: From March 2016 to September 2017, 281 patients were randomized  (relugolix, n=139, leuprorelin n=142). Demographic and baseline characteristics  were well balanced; mean pictorial blood loss assessment chart score was 254.3  in the relugolix group and 263.7 in the leuprorelin group. The proportion of  patients with total pictorial blood loss assessment chart score of less than 10  for weeks 6-12 was 82.2% in the relugolix group and 83.1% in the leuprorelin  group, demonstrating noninferiority of relugolix compared with leuprorelin  (relugolix-leuprorelin difference -0.9%; 95% CI: -10.10 to 8.35; prespecified  noninferiority margin -15%; P=.001). Reductions in myoma and uterine volumes and  increases in hemoglobin levels were comparable in the two groups. Relugolix was  associated with an earlier effect on menstrual bleeding than leuprorelin  (pictorial blood loss assessment chart score of less than 10, 64.2% vs 31.7%  [relugolix-leuprorelin difference 32.5%; 95% CI: 20.95-44.13%] for weeks 2-6 and  pictorial blood loss assessment chart score of 0, 52.6% vs 21.8% [30.7%; 95% CI:  19.45-42.00%] for weeks 2-6) and faster recovery of menses after treatment  discontinuation (relugolix median [Q1, Q3], 37 days [32.0, 46.0]; leuprorelin  median, 65 days [54.0, 77.0]). Adverse events and bone mineral density loss were  similar between relugolix and leuprorelin treatment groups. CONCLUSION: In women with uterine leiomyomas, once-daily treatment with  relugolix, an oral gonadotropin-releasing hormone antagonist, demonstrated  noninferiority to monthly leuprorelin for improvement of heavy menstrual  bleeding at 6-12 weeks of treatment, had a more rapid effect on menstrual  bleeding, and was generally well tolerated.

The  use of new compounds, such as natalizumab or fingolimod, is restricted to severe  forms of relapsing MS or cases refractory to first-line treatment owing to  substance-specific risk-benefit considerations. Teriflunomide is a new compound  which has recently been approved as a first-line treatment of relapsing forms of  MS in the USA and Australia. It is characterized by a once daily oral  administration and a comparably well-established long-term safety profile. The  main therapeutic effect is considered to be mediated via the inhibition of the  de novo synthesis of pyrimidine in proliferating immune cells.

Overall, the safety profile in these studies was favorable as  expected from experiences with leflunomide in RA. In patients treated with  teriflunomide regular monitoring of blood cell counts and liver enzymes is  required. Teriflunomide must not be used during pregnancy.

Riluzole  prolongs survival in ALS. A published report has suggested a dramatic effect of  lithium carbonate on survival. 44 patients were studied, with 16 randomly  selected to take LiCO3 and riluzole and 28 allocated to take riluzole alone. In  the group treated with lithium, no patients had died (i.e., 100% survival) at  the end of the study (15 months from entry), compared to 71% surviving in the  riluzole-only group. Although the trial can be criticised on several grounds,  there is a substantial rationale from other laboratory studies that lithium is  worth investigating therapeutically in amyotrophic lateral sclerosis. METHODS/DESIGN: LiCALS is a multi-centre double-blind randomised parallel group  controlled trial of the efficacy, safety, and tolerability of lithium carbonate  (LiCO3) at doses to achieve stable 'therapeutic' plasma levels (0.4-0.8 mmol/L),  plus standard treatment, versus matched placebo plus standard treatment, in  patients with amyotrophic lateral sclerosis. The study will be based in the UK,  in partnership with the MND Association and DeNDRoN (the Dementias and  Neurodegnerative Diseases Clinical Research Network). 220 patients will be  recruited. All patients will be on the standard treatment for ALS of riluzole  100 mg daily. The primary outcome measure will be death from any cause at 18  months defined from the date of randomisation.

Elagolix coadministered with estradiol/norethindrone acetate is in late-stage  development for the management of heavy menstrual bleeding associated with  uterine fibroids. Based on the in vitro profile of elagolix metabolism and  disposition, 9 drug-drug interaction (DDI) studies evaluating the victim and  perpetrator characteristics of elagolix were conducted in 144 healthy  volunteers. As a victim of cytochrome P450 (CYPs) and transporter-mediated DDIs,  elagolix area under the curve (AUC) increased by ∼2-fold following  coadministration with ketoconazole and by ∼5- and ∼2-fold with single and  multiple doses of rifampin, respectively. As a perpetrator, elagolix decreased  midazolam AUC (90% confidence interval) by 54% (50%-59%) and increased digoxin  AUC by 32% (23%-41%). Elagolix decreased rosuvastatin AUC by 40% (29%-50%). No  clinically significant changes in exposure on coadministration with sertraline  or fluconazole occurred. A elagolix 150-mg once-daily regimen should be limited  to 6\xa0months with strong CYP3A inhibitors and rifampin because of the potential  increase in bone mineral density loss, as described in the drug label. A 200-mg  twice-daily regimen is recommended for no more than 1\xa0month with strong CYP3A  inhibitors and not recommended with rifampin. Elagolix is contraindicated with  strong organic anion transporter polypeptide B1 inhibitors (eg, cyclosporine and  gemfibrozil). Consider increasing the doses of midazolam and rosuvastatin when  coadministered with elagolix, and individualize therapy based on patient  response.

Two benzothiazolamines, riluzole and lubeluzole,  are known blockers of voltage-gated sodium (Nav) channels. Riluzole is  clinically used as a neuroprotectant in amyotrophic lateral sclerosis.  Inhibition of Nav channels by riluzole is voltage-dependent due to preferential  binding to inactivated sodium channels. Yet the drug exerts little use-dependent  block, probably because it lacks protonable amine. One important property is  riluzole ability to inhibit persistent Na+ currents, which likely contributes to  its neuroprotective activity. Lubeluzole showed promising neuroprotective  effects in animal stroke models, but failed to show benefits in acute ischemic  stroke in humans. One important concern is its propensity to prolong the cardiac  QT interval, due to hERG K+ channel block. Lubeluzole very potently inhibits Nav  channels in a voltage- and use-dependent manner, due to its great preferential  affinity for inactivated channels and the presence of a protonable amine group.  Patch-clamp experiments suggest that the binding sites of both drugs overlap the  local anesthetic receptor within the ion-conducting pathway. Riluzole and  lubeluzole displayed very potent antimyotonic activity in a rat model of  myotonia, a pathological skeletal muscle condition characterized by  high-frequency runs of action potentials. Such results well support the  repurposing of riluzole as an antimyotonic drug, allowing the launch of a pilot  study in myotonic patients. Riluzole, lubeluzole, and new Nav channel blockers  built on the benzothiazolamine scaffold will certainly continue to be  investigated for possible clinical applications.', 'The aim of these studies was to assess the safety and pharmacokinetics of  elagolix, an oral nonpeptide gonadotropin-releasing hormone antagonist following  oral administration in women with renal or hepatic impairment. Two phase 1  studies were conducted in adult women with normal renal function versus renal  impairment (reduced study), and normal hepatic function versus hepatic  impairment (full study design). All women received a single dose of elagolix 200  mg (renal) or 150 mg (hepatic). Intensive pharmacokinetic blood samples were  collected. Elagolix exposures were comparable in women with normal renal  function and those with moderate/severe renal impairment or end-stage renal  disease. Elagolix exposures also appeared to be similar in women with normal  hepatic function and women with mild hepatic impairment. Elagolix area under the  curve in women with moderate hepatic impairment and with severe hepatic  impairment was approximately 3-fold and 7-fold higher than in women with normal  hepatic function. The adverse event incidence was low, with the main events  being mild nausea and headache. No dosage adjustment was needed in women with  renal impairment or women with mild hepatic impairment. Although an elagolix  dose of 150 mg once daily may be used in women with moderate hepatic impairment  for up to 6 months, this elagolix dose should not be used in women with severe  hepatic impairment.']","Relugolix has a role in treatment of prostate cancer, uterine fibroids, endometriosis and uterine myomas."
30,Has field-programmable gate array (FPGA) technology been used to solve sequence alignment problems?,"['To infer homology and subsequently gene function, the Smith-Waterman algorithm  is used to find the optimal local alignment between two sequences. When  searching sequence databases that may contain billions of sequences, this  algorithm becomes computationally expensive. Consequently, in this paper, we  focused on accelerating the Smith-Waterman algorithm by modifying the  computationally repeated portion of the algorithm by FPGA hardware custom  instructions. These simple modifications accelerated the algorithm runtime by an  average of 287% compared to the pure software implementation. Therefore, further  design of FPGA accelerated hardware offers a promising direction to seeking  runtime improvement of genomic database searching.', 'BACKGROUND: This paper describes techniques for accelerating the performance of  the string set matching problem with particular emphasis on applications in  computational proteomics. The process of matching peptide sequences against a  genome translated in six reading frames is part of a proteogenomic mapping  pipeline that is used as a case-study. The Aho-Corasick algorithm is adapted for  execution in field programmable gate array (FPGA) devices in a manner that  optimizes space and performance. In this approach, the traditional Aho-Corasick  finite state machine (FSM) is split into smaller FSMs, operating in parallel,  each of which matches up to 20 peptides in the input translated genome. Each of  the smaller FSMs is further divided into five simpler FSMs such that each simple  FSM operates on a single bit position in the input (five bits are sufficient for  representing all amino acids and special symbols in protein sequences). RESULTS: This bit-split organization of the Aho-Corasick implementation enables  efficient utilization of the limited random access memory (RAM) resources  available in typical FPGAs. The use of on-chip RAM as opposed to FPGA logic  resources for FSM implementation also enables rapid reconfiguration of the FPGA  without the place and routing delays associated with complex digital designs. CONCLUSION: Experimental results show storage efficiencies of over 80% for  several data sets. Furthermore, the FPGA implementation executing at 100 MHz is  nearly 20 times faster than an implementation of the traditional Aho-Corasick  algorithm executing on a 2.67 GHz workstation.', 'Large-scale protein sequence comparison is an important but compute-intensive  task in molecular biology. BLASTP is the most popular tool for comparative  analysis of protein sequences. In recent years, an exponential increase in the  size of protein sequence databases has required either exponentially more  running time or a cluster of machines to keep pace. To address this problem, we  have designed and built a high-performance FPGA-accelerated version of BLASTP,  Mercury BLASTP. In this paper, we describe the architecture of the portions of  the application that are accelerated in the FPGA, and we also describe the  integration of these FPGA-accelerated portions with the existing BLASTP  software. We have implemented Mercury BLASTP on a commodity workstation with two  Xilinx Virtex-II 6000 FPGAs. We show that the new design runs 11-15 times faster  than software BLASTP on a modern CPU while delivering close to 99% identical  results.', 'Advances in computational biology have occurred primarily in the areas of  software and algorithm development; new designs of hardware to support  biological computing are extremely scarce. This is due, we believe, to the  presence of a non-trivial knowledge gap between molecular biologists and  computer designers. The existence of this gap is unfortunate, as it has long  been known that for certain problems, special-purpose computers can achieve  significant cost/performance gains over general-purpose machines. We describe  one such computer here: a custom accelerator for gene sequence analysis. The  accelerator implements a version of the Needleman-Wunsch algorithm for  nucleotide sequence alignment. Sequence lengths are constrained only by  available memory; the product of sequence lengths in the current implementation  can be up to 2(22). The machine is implemented as two NuBus boards connected to  a Mac IIf/x, using a mixture of TTL and FPGA technology clocked at 10 MHz. The  boards are completely functional, and yield a 15-fold performance improvement  over an unassisted host.', ""BACKGROUND: To infer homology and subsequently gene function, the Smith-Waterman  (SW) algorithm is used to find the optimal local alignment between two  sequences.

RESULTS: In this paper, we focused on accelerating the Smith-Waterman algorithm  by using FPGA-based hardware that implemented a module for computing the score  of a single cell of the SW matrix. Then using a grid of this module, the entire  SW matrix was computed at the speed of field propagation through the FPGA  circuit. These modifications dramatically accelerated the algorithm's  computation time by up to 160 folds compared to a pure software implementation  running on the same FPGA with an Altera Nios II softprocessor.

In a query preprocessing  step, a set of tables can be built that permit one to (a) eliminate a large  fraction of the dynamic programming matrix from consideration and (b) to compute  several steps of the remainder with a single table lookup. While this result is  not an asymptotic improvement over the original Smith-Waterman algorithm, its  complexity is characterized in terms of some sparse features of the matrix and  it yields the fastest software implementation to date for such searches.', 'BACKGROUND: The Smith-Waterman algorithm is known to be a more sensitive  approach than heuristic algorithms for local sequence alignment algorithms.  Despite its sensitivity, a greater time complexity associated with the  Smith-Waterman algorithm prevents its application to the all-pairs comparisons  of base sequences, which aids in the construction of accurate phylogenetic  trees. The aim of this study is to achieve greater acceleration using the  Smith-Waterman algorithm (by realizing interpair block pruning and band  optimization) compared with that achieved using a previous method that performs  intrapair block pruning on graphics processing units (GPUs). RESULTS: We present an interpair optimization method for the Smith-Waterman  algorithm with the aim of accelerating the all-pairs comparison of base  sequences. Given the results of the pairs of sequences, our method realizes  efficient block pruning by computing a lower bound for other pairs that have not  yet been processed. This lower bound is further used for band optimization. We  integrated our interpair optimization method into SW#, a previous GPU-based  implementation that employs variants of a banded Smith-Waterman algorithm and a  banded Myers-Miller algorithm. Evaluation using the six genomes of Bacillus  anthracis shows that our method pruned 88% of the matrix cells on a single GPU  and 73% of the matrix cells on two GPUs. For the genomes of the human chromosome  21, the alignment performance reached 202 giga-cell updates per second (GCUPS)  on two Tesla K40 GPUs. CONCLUSIONS: Efficient interpair pruning and band optimization makes it possible  to complete the all-pairs comparisons of the sequences of the same species 1.2  times faster than the intrapair pruning method. This acceleration was achieved  at the first phase of SW#, where our method significantly improved the initial  lower bound. However, our interpair optimization was not effective for the  comparison of the sequences of different species such as comparing human,  chimpanzee, and gorilla. Consequently, our method is useful in accelerating the  applications that require optimal local alignments scores for the same species.

In the analysis of BS-seq data, this can  present an important performance bottleneck that can be mitigated by appropriate  algorithmic and software-engineering improvements. One strategy is to modify the  read-alignment algorithms by integrating the logic related to BS-seq alignment,  with the goal of making the software implementation amenable to optimizations  that lead to higher speed and greater sensitivity than might otherwise be  attainable. RESULTS: We evaluated this strategy using Arioc, a short-read aligner that uses  GPU (general-purpose graphics processing unit) hardware to accelerate  computationally-expensive programming logic. We integrated the BS-seq  computational logic into both GPU and CPU code throughout the Arioc  implementation. We then carried out a read-by-read comparison of Arioc's  reported alignments with the alignments reported by well-known CPU-based BS-seq  read aligners. With simulated reads, Arioc's accuracy is equal to or better than  the other read aligners we evaluated. With human sequencing reads, Arioc's  throughput is at least 10 times faster than existing BS-seq aligners across a  wide range of sensitivity settings.

Most of these algorithms rely on comparing the frequency of all the  distinct substrings of fixed length (k-mers) that occur in the analyzed  sequences. In this paper, we present Logic Alignment Free (LAF), a method that  combines alignment-free techniques and rule-based classification algorithms in  order to assign biological samples to their taxa. This method searches for a  minimal subset of k-mers whose relative frequencies are used to build  classification models as disjunctive-normal-form logic formulas (if-then rules).  We apply LAF successfully to the classification of bacterial genomes to their  corresponding taxonomy. In particular, we succeed in obtaining reliable  classification at different taxonomic levels by extracting a handful of rules,  each one based on the frequency of just few k-mers. State of the art methods to  adjust the frequency of k-mers to the character distribution of the underlying  genomes have negligible impact on classification performance, suggesting that  the signal of each class is strong and that LAF is effective in identifying it.']","Yes.

31,Which are the main functions of the human HuR (ELAVL1) protein in fibroblasts?,"[""In this study, we investigated the molecular mechanisms underlying the ATP  analogue adenosine-5'-O-(3-thio)triphosphate-induced nucleocytoplasmic shuttling  of the mRNA stabilizing factor HuR in human (h) mesangial cells (MC). Using  synthetic protein kinase C (PKC) inhibitors and small interfering RNA  approaches, we demonstrated that knockdown of PKC alpha efficiently blocked the  ATP-dependent nuclear HuR export to the cytoplasm. The functional importance of  PKC alpha in HuR shuttling is highlighted by the high cytosolic HuR content  detected in hMC stably overexpressing PKC alpha compared with mock-transfected  cells. The ATP-induced recruitment of HuR to the cytoplasm is preceded by a  direct interaction of PKC alpha with nuclear HuR and accompanied by increased  Ser phosphorylation as demonstrated by coimmunoprecipitation experiments.  Mapping of putative PKC target sites identified serines 158 and 221 as being  indispensable for HuR phosphorylation by PKC alpha. RNA pull-down assay and RNA  electrophoretic mobility shift assay demonstrated that the HuR shuttling by ATP  is accompanied by an increased HuR binding to cyclooxygenase (COX)-2 mRNA.  Physiologically, the ATP-dependent increase in RNA binding is linked with an  augmentation in COX-2 mRNA stability and subsequent increase in prostaglandin  E(2) synthesis. Regulation of HuR via PKC alpha-dependent phosphorylation  emphasizes the importance of posttranslational modification for  stimulus-dependent HuR shuttling."", 'We report the antiapoptotic effect of RNA-binding protein HuR, a critical  regulator of the post-transcriptional fate of target transcripts. Among the most  prominent mRNAs complexing with HuR is that encoding prothymosin alpha  (ProTalpha), an inhibitor of the apoptosome. In HeLa cells, treatment with the  apoptotic stimulus ultraviolet light (UVC) triggered the mobilization of  ProTalpha mRNA to the cytoplasm and onto heavier polysomes, where its  association with HuR increased dramatically. Analysis of a chimeric ProTalpha  mRNA directly implicated HuR in regulating ProTalpha production: ProTalpha  translation and cytoplasmic concentration increased in HuR-overexpressing cells  and declined in cells in which HuR levels were lowered by RNA interference.  Importantly, the antiapoptotic influence engendered by HuR was vitally dependent  on ProTalpha expression, since use of oligomers that blocked ProTalpha  translation abrogated the protective effect of HuR. Together, our data support a  regulatory scheme whereby HuR binds the ProTalpha mRNA, elevates its cytoplasmic  abundance and translation, and thereby elicits an antiapoptotic program.', 'p19(ARF) plays an essential role in the senescence of mouse cells, and its  expression is lost by methylation or deletion of the ARF locus; otherwise, p53  is inactivated to bypass senescence. ARF expression is tightly regulated, but  little is known about its posttranscriptional regulation. Here, we show that an  RNA-binding protein, HuR (human antigen R), represses ARF mRNA translation,  thereby maintaining the replicative life span of mouse embryonic fibroblasts  (MEFs). Loss of HuR results in premature senescence, with concomitant increases  in p19(ARF) but not p16(Ink4a) levels, and this senescence is not observed in  ARF-null MEFs that retain an intact Ink4a locus. HuR depletion does not alter  ARF transcription or stability but enhances ribosome association with ARF mRNA.  Under these conditions, ARF mRNA accumulates in nucleoli, where it associates  with nucleolin. Furthermore, adipose-specific deletion of the HuR gene results  in increased p19(ARF) expression in aged animals, which is accompanied by  decreased insulin sensitivity. Together, our findings demonstrate that p19(ARF)  is also regulated at the translational level, and this translational regulation  restrains the cellular life span and tissue functions in vivo.', ""The cytoplasmic events that control mammalian gene expression, primarily mRNA  stability and translation, potently influence the cellular response to internal  and external signals. The ubiquitous RNA-binding protein (RBP) HuR is one of the  best-studied regulators of cytoplasmic mRNA fate. Through its  post-transcriptional influence on specific target mRNAs, HuR can alter the  cellular response to proliferative, stress, apoptotic, differentiation,  senescence, inflammatory and immune stimuli. In light of its central role in  important cellular functions, HuR's role in diseases in which these responses  are aberrant is increasingly appreciated. Here, we review the mechanisms that  control HuR function, its influence on target mRNAs, and how impairment in  HuR-governed gene expression programs impact upon different disease processes.  We focus on HuR's well-recognized implication in cancer and chronic  inflammation, and discuss emerging studies linking HuR to cardiovascular,  neurological, and muscular pathologies. We also discuss the progress, potential,  and challenges of targeting HuR therapeutically."", ""In the nucleus HuR binds to mRNAs containing adenylate-uridylate rich elements  in the 3'-untranslated region. HuR may influence expression of its ligand mRNA  through regulation of polyadenylation, translocation of the message to the  cytosol, stabilization of the mRNA and/or altering its translational efficiency.  Suppression of HuR using siRNA resulted in an attenuation of the 3T3-L1  differentiation program, consistent with HuR control of the expression of mRNA  ligand(s) critical to the differentiation process. In the present study, we  begin to identify mRNA ligands of HuR whose regulated expression is necessary  for adipogenesis."", ""The post-transcriptional control of specific mRNAs is a widespread mechanism of  gene regulation, which contributes to numerous biological processes in a number  of cell types. The Forkhead box O (FoxO) transcription factor FOXO1 is an  important tumor suppressor involved in apoptosis, the cell cycle, DNA damage  repair and oxidative stress. Bioinformatic prediction identified that the 3'  untranslated region (UTR) of FOXO1 is enriched with binding motifs for the human  ELAV/Hu protein (HuR), indicating that FOXO1 is a potential target of HuR.  Luciferase reporter assays demonstrate that HuR specifically regulates FOXO1  expression through AU-rich elements (AREs) within the FOXO1 3' UTR.  Immunoprecipitation studies confirmed that HuR associates with FOXO1 mRNA in  MDA-MB-231 breast cancer cells and that HuR upregulates FOXO1 mRNA levels  through increased mRNA stability. Using a HuR loss- and gain-of-function  approach, we revealed that FOXO1 expression was correspondingly decreased or  increased in MDA-MB-231 cells. Functional assays demonstrated that HuR and FOXO1  expression levels were markedly enhanced upon 5-fluorouracil (5-FU) stimulation  in MDA-MB-231 cells. Knockdown of HuR apparently abrogated 5-FU-induced  apoptosis detected by caspase-3 activities. Furthermore, in HuR knockdown cells,  additional overexpression of FOXO1 moderately recovered 5-FU-induced apoptosis,  which verified that HuR-modulated apoptosis upon 5-FU treatment was partially  mediated by its post-transcriptional regulation of FOXO1. Therefore, modulating  FOXO1 expression has been suggested to lead to the development of new  therapeutic treatments for certain types of cancer."", ""The RNA binding protein HuR regulates the stability of many target mRNAs. Here,  we report that HuR associated with the 3' untranslated region of the mRNA  encoding the longevity and stress-response protein SIRT1, stabilized the SIRT1  mRNA, and increased SIRT1 expression levels. Unexpectedly, oxidative stress  triggered the dissociation of the [HuR-SIRT1 mRNA] complex, in turn promoting  SIRT1 mRNA decay, reducing SIRT1 abundance, and lowering cell survival. The cell  cycle checkpoint kinase Chk2 was activated by H(2)O(2), interacted with HuR, and  was predicted to phosphorylate HuR at residues S88, S100, and T118. Mutation of  these residues revealed a complex pattern of HuR binding, with S100 appearing to  be important for [HuR-SIRT1 mRNA] dissociation after H(2)O(2). Our findings  demonstrate that HuR regulates SIRT1 expression, underscore functional links  between the two stress-response proteins, and implicate Chk2 in these processes."", ""HuR is a ligand for nuclear mRNAs containing adenylate-uridylate rich elements  in the 3'-untranslated region.

We have previously demonstrated that HuR is  constitutively expressed in the 3T3-L1 cells and shuttles from the nucleus to  the cytosol, but remains predominantly nuclear in the preadipocytes and that as  the cells differentiate, there is a marked increase in the proportion of HuR in  the cytosol at any time. The GLUT1 glucose transporter is also expressed in both  preadipocytes and adipocytes and in vitro RNA gel shifts indicate the mRNA is a  ligand for HuR. However, HuR complexes containing the GLUT1 mRNA can only be  isolated from the terminally differentiated adipocytes. Moreover, position  analysis of the GLUT1 mRNA and HuR protein in polysome profiles demonstrates a  shift to the most dense region of the gradient for both message and protein with  adipocyte differentiation. Consistent with a regulatory role in the control of  GLUT1 expression, siRNA-mediated decrease in HuR protein resulted in a decreased  expression of GLUT1 protein. These data suggest that HuR contributes to the  metabolic function of the adipocyte through mediation of post-transcriptional  regulatory events."", ""Tumors of the central nervous system (CNS) often have sustained expression of  labile genes, including angiogenic growth factors and immunosuppressive  cytokines, which promote tumor progression. Stabilization of the RNA transcripts  for these genes, such as vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF), is an  important molecular pathway for this up-regulation. HuR, a member of the Elav  family of RNA-binding proteins, has been implicated in this pathway through its  binding to adenine and uridine (AU)-rich stability elements (ARE) located in the  3' untranslated regions (3'-UTRs) of the mRNA. Whereas three of the Elav family  members (Hel-N1, HuC, and HuD) are restricted to young and mature neurons, HuR  is more broadly expressed, including proliferating cells of the developing CNS.  Because RNA stabilization of labile genes may promote tumor growth, we analyzed  and compared the expression pattern of HuR in 35 freshly resected and cultured  CNS tumors to determine whether there was any correlation with tumor grade or  histological type. We found that HuR mRNA was consistently expressed in all of  the tumors, regardless of cell origin or degree of malignancy. Using a novel  HuR-specific polyclonal antibody, we found that strong HuR protein expression  was limited to high-grade malignancies (glioblastoma multiforme and  medulloblastoma). Within the glioblastoma multiforme, prominent HuR expression  was also detected in perinecrotic areas in which angiogenic growth factors are  up-regulated. To further define its role as a potential RNA stabilizer, we  analyzed whether HuR could bind to the stability motifs within the 3'-UTRs of  cytokines and growth factors linked to brain tumor progression. We used a novel  ELISA-based RNA binding assay and focused on the 3'-UTRs of angiogenic factors  VEGF, COX-2, and (interleukin) IL-8 as well as the immunomodulating factors  IL-6, transforming growth factor (TGF)-beta and tumor necrosis factor  (TNF)-alpha as potential RNA ligands. Our results indicated overall a very high  binding affinity to these RNA targets. A comparison of these ligands revealed a  hierarchy of binding affinities with the angiogenic factors, and TGF-beta  showing the highest (Kd of 1.8-3.4 nM), and TNF-alpha the lowest (Kd of 18.3  nM). The expression pattern of HuR, coupled with the RNA binding data, strongly  suggests a role for this protein in the posttranscriptional regulation of these  genes in CNS tumors.""]","HuR is an RNA-binding protein that can stabilize labile mRNAs containing AU-rich elements in their 3' untranslated regions and has been shown to shuttle between the nucleus and cytoplasm. HuR function was previously shown to be implicated in the maintenance of a ""young cell"" phenotype in models of replicative cellular senescence. Loss of HuR is linked to reduced expression of proliferative genes during replicative senescence. Importantly, overexpression of HuR in senescent cells restored a ""younger"" phenotype, while a reduction in HuR expression accentuated the senescent phenotype. HuR associated with the 3' untranslated region of the mRNA encoding the longevity and stress-response protein SIRT1, stabilized the SIRT1 mRNA, and increased SIRT1 expression levels. In mesenchymal cells HuR plays a dominant role in lung development and as a key post-transcriptional regulator of networks guiding tissue remodeling during branching morphogenesis. In fibroblasts knockdown of HuR decreased the endogenous expression of TGFβ1 under exogenous TGFβ1 treatment, simultaneously with the decrease of Col1a, Col3a and fibronectin expression.  HuR (human antigen R), represses ARF mRNA translation, thereby maintaining the replicative life span of mouse embryonic fibroblasts (MEFs). HuR is considered a global regulator of cell-cycle progression and tumorigenesis. Through its post-transcriptional influence on specific target mRNAs, HuR can alter the cellular response to proliferative, stress, apoptotic, differentiation, senescence, inflammatory and immune stimuli."
32,Which chromosome contains the TLR7 locus in the human genome?,"['Cutaneous melanoma is a life-threatening skin cancer. Its incidence is rapidly  increasing, and early diagnosis is the main factor able to improve its poor  prognosis. Toll-like receptors (TLRs) are transmembrane glycoproteins that  recognize pathogen- and damage-associated molecular patterns, against which TLRs  activate the innate immune response and initiate the adaptive immune response.  Genetic variations of these receptors may alter the immune system, and are  involved in evolution and susceptibility to various diseases, including cancer.  The aim of the present study was to evaluate whether the presence of TLR7  glutamine (Gln) 11 leucine (Leu) polymorphism confers an increased  susceptibility to cutaneous melanoma. For that purpose, a case-control study was  performed with 182 melanoma cases and 89 controls. To highlight the possible  association between the aforementioned polymorphism and the susceptibility to  melanoma, 93 cases of single melanoma and 89 cases of multiple primary melanoma  (MPM) were compared in the present study. Since the TLR7 gene is localized on  the chromosome X, the allelic frequency of the Gln11Leu polymorphism was  analyzed separately in males and females. The distribution of allele frequencies  between melanoma cases and controls (P=0.245) and between single melanoma and  MPM cases (P=0.482) was not significant. Therefore, the present results do not  suggest an association between TLR7 Gln11Leu polymorphism and susceptibility to  cutaneous melanoma. Further studies are required to analyze the influence of  other TLR polymorphisms on the susceptibility to malignant melanoma and the  involvement of innate immunity in this malignancy.', 'The y-linked autoimmune accelerating (yaa) locus is a potent autoimmune disease  allele. Transcription profiling of yaa-bearing B cells revealed the  overexpression of a cluster of X-linked genes that included Tlr7. FISH analysis  demonstrated the translocation of this segment onto the yaa chromosome. The  resulting overexpression of Tlr7 increased in vitro responses to Toll-like  receptor (TLR) 7 signaling in all yaa-bearing males. B6.yaa mice are not overtly  autoimmune, but the addition of Sle1, which contains the autoimmune-predisposing  Slam/Cd2 haplotype, causes the development of fatal lupus with numerous  immunological aberrations. B6.Sle1yaa CD4 T cells develop the molecular  signature for T(FH) cells and also show expression changes in numerous cytokines  and chemokines. Disease development and all component autoimmune phenotypes were  inhibited by Sles1, a potent suppressor locus. Sles1 had no effect on  yaa-enhanced TLR7 signaling in vitro, and these data place Sles1 downstream from  the lesion in innate immune responses mediated by TLR7, suggesting that Sles1  modulates the activation of adaptive immunity in response to innate immune  signaling.', 'The Y-linked autoimmune accelerating (Yaa) locus drives the transition to fatal  lupus nephritis when combined with B6.Sle1 in our C57BL/6J (B6)-congenic model  of systemic autoimmunity. We and others recently demonstrated that the  translocation of a cluster of X-linked genes onto the Y chromosome is the  genetic lesion underlying Yaa (Subramanian, S. et al., Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci.  USA 2006. 103: 9970-9975; Pisitkun, P. et al., Science 2006. 312: 1669-1672). In  male mice carrying Yaa, the transcription of several genes within the  translocated segment is increased roughly twofold. Although the translocated X  chromosome segment in Yaa may contain as many as 16 genes, the major candidate  gene for causation of the Yaa-associated autoimmune phenotypes has been TLR7. To  confirm the role of TLR7 in Yaa-mediated autoimmune phenotypes, we introgressed  a targeted disruption of TLR7 (TLR7(-)) onto B6.Sle1Yaa to produce  B6.Sle1YaaTLR7(-) and examined evidence of disease at 6 and 9 months of age. Our  results demonstrate that the up-regulation of TLR7 in the B6.Sle1Yaa strain is  responsible for splenomegaly, glomerular nephritis and the majority of the  cellular abnormalities of B, T and myeloid cells. The up-regulation of TLR7 was  also responsible for driving the infiltration and activation of leukocytes in  the kidney, in which activated T cells were a primary component. However, the  resolution of TLR7 up-regulation did not eliminate the enhanced humoral  autoimmunity observed in B6.SleYaa, suggesting that additional elements in the  translocation may contribute to the disease phenotype.', 'Human plasmacytoid dendritic cells (pDCs) play a major role in innate immunity  through the production of type I IFNs after TLR engagement by pathogens.  Sex-based differences in the innate function of human pDCs have been  established, with pDCs from women exhibiting enhanced TLR7-mediated IFN-α  production as compared with pDCs from males. In mice, we recently provided  evidence for a role of estrogens as a positive regulator of pDC innate functions  through cell-intrinsic estrogen receptor α signaling, but did not exclude a role  for other X-linked factors, particularly in human pDCs. In this study, we  investigated the respective contribution of X chromosome dosage and sex hormones  using a humanized mouse model in which male or female NOD-SCID-β2m(-/-) were  transplanted with human progenitor cells purified from either male or female  cord blood cells. We showed that, in response to TLR7 ligands, the frequency of  IFN-α- and TNF-α-producing pDCs from either sex was greater in female than in  male host mice, suggesting a positive role for estrogens. Indeed, blockade of  estrogen receptor signaling during pDC development in vitro inhibited  TLR7-mediated IFN-α production by human pDCs, which expressed both ESR1 and ESR2  genes. Interestingly, we also found that X chromosome dosage contributed to this  sex bias as female pDCs have an enhanced TLR7-mediated IFN-α response as  compared with male ones, irrespective of the sex of the recipient mice.  Together, these results indicate that female sex hormones, estrogens, and X  chromosome complement independently contribute to the enhanced TLR7-mediated  IFN-α response of pDCs in women.', ""INTRODUCTION: The Toll-like receptor 7 (TLR7) gene, encoded on human chromosome  Xp22.3, is crucial for type I interferon production. A recent multicenter study  in East Asian populations, comprising Chinese, Korean and Japanese participants,  identified an association of a TLR7 single-nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) located  in the 3' untranslated region (3' UTR), rs3853839, with systemic lupus  erythematosus (SLE), especially in males, although some difference was observed  among the tested populations. To test whether additional polymorphisms  contribute to SLE in Japanese, we systematically analyzed the association of  TLR7 with SLE in a Japanese female population. METHODS: A case-control association study was conducted on eight tag SNPs in the  TLR7 region, including rs3853839, in 344 Japanese females with SLE and 274  healthy female controls. RESULTS: In addition to rs3853839, two SNPs in intron 2, rs179019 and rs179010,  which were in moderate linkage disequilibrium with each other (r2 = 0.53),  showed an association with SLE (rs179019: P = 0.016, odds ratio (OR) 2.02, 95%  confidence interval (95% CI) 1.15 to 3.54; rs179010: P = 0.018, OR 1.75, 95% CI  1.10 to 2.80 (both under the recessive model)). Conditional logistic regression  analysis revealed that the association of the intronic SNPs and the 3' UTR SNP  remained significant after we adjusted them for each other. When only the  patients and controls carrying the risk genotypes at the 3' UTR SNP position  were analyzed, the risk of SLE was significantly increased when the individuals  also carried the risk genotypes at both of the intronic SNPs (P = 0.0043, OR  2.45, 95% CI 1.31 to 4.60). Furthermore, the haplotype containing the intronic  risk alleles in addition to the 3' UTR risk allele was associated with SLE under  the recessive model (P = 0.016, OR 2.37, 95% CI 1.17 to 4.80), but other  haplotypes were not associated with SLE. CONCLUSIONS: The TLR7 intronic SNPs rs179019 and rs179010 are associated with  SLE independently of the 3' UTR SNP rs3853839 in Japanese women. Our findings  support a role of TLR7 in predisposition for SLE in Asian populations."", 'Infection is believed to be a leading cause of preterm premature rupture of  membranes (PPROM). The bacterial cell wall component, lipopolysaccharide (LPS),  is thought to initiate tissue responses leading to PPROM in the setting of Gram  negative infection. LPS is recognized by the innate immune system, including the  proteins encoded by the CARD15 and TLR4 genes. A recently described mutation  (2936insC) in CARD15 and a polymorphism in TLR4 896 A>G impair responses to LPS.  The objective of this study was to determine if African Americans, who have a  higher incidence of PPROM than Caucasians, have different frequencies of the  mutant CARD15 allele and the TLR4 hyporesponsive variant, and if risk of PPROM  is influenced by fetal carriage of these alleles. The allele frequencies for the  CARD15 mutation and the TLR4 896G variant in African Americans were similar to  those reported for Caucasians. There was no association between the TLR4 alleles  examined and PPROM. However, the CARD15 mutation was only detected in controls  and not in PPROM cases. We conclude that the CARD15 mutation and hyporesponsive  TLR4 allele do not contribute to ethnic variation in the incidence of PPROM.', ""The human genome is rich in sequences which are structurally related to the 7SL  RNA component of the signal recognition particle. The 7SL DNA sequence family  consists of four 7SL genes, 500 7SL pseudogenes (which are truncated at one or  both ends of the 7SL sequence) and 500,000 Alu sequences. Both 7SL genes and Alu  elements are transcribed by RNA polymerase III, and we show here that the  internal 7SL promoter lies within the Alu-like part of the 7SL gene. Why then  does RNA polymerase III transcribe the few 7SL genes so efficiently, while  transcripts from the far more abundant Alu elements are not readily detectable?  We find that a human 7SL gene and a synthetic Alu sequence derived from it are  expressed 50-100-fold more efficiently in vitro than either a representative Alu  element or two 7SL pseudogenes. 5' Deletion and insertion mutants of the 7SL  gene demonstrate that, in conjunction with the internal promoter, the first 37  nucleotides upstream from the transcription start site are essential for  efficient and accurate initiation in vitro. We suggest that the genomic  sequences upstream from most Alu elements and 7SL pseudogenes do not contain  this element, and consequently that only a small subset of such sequences can be  transcribed in vivo. This may help to explain the homogeneity of the Alu family  within each mammalian genome, as well as the species-specific differences  between mammalian Alu families."", 'The Drosophila gene Spätzle encodes the activating ligand for the Toll receptor.  This signaling pathway is required for dorso-ventral patterning in the early  embryo and an antifungal immune response in larvae and adults. The genome  sequence of Drosophila shows that there are a total of eight Toll-like receptors  and these may function in other aspects of embryonic development and innate  immunity. Here we describe five Drosophila homologues of Spätzle (Spz2-6) found  using an iterative searching method. All five appear to encode proteins  containing neurotrophin-like cystine-knot domains. In addition, most retain a  characteristic intron-exon structure shared with the prototype Spätzle gene.  This provides evidence that the family arose by ancient gene duplication events  and indicates that the gene products may represent activating ligands for  corresponding Toll receptors. Expression studies show that only Spz4 is  expressed strongly in larvae and adults and thus may be involved in an ancillary  antifungal response mediated by Toll-5. By contrast, Spz6 shows a complex  spatial and temporally regulated expression pattern in the late embryo. Thus the  new Toll/Spätzle families of signaling molecules may have important roles in  other aspects of development and immunity.', 'OBJECTIVES: To determine whether genetic variation within genes related to the  Toll-like receptor, inflammasome and interferon-γ pathways contributes to the  differences in treatment response to tumour necrosis factor inhibitors  (anti-TNF) in patients with rheumatoid arthritis (RA). METHODS: In a retrospective case-case study, we assessed 23 functional single  nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) in 15 genes. We included 538 anti-TNF naïve  Danish RA patients from the nationwide DANBIO database. Multivariable logistic  regression analyses were performed to detect associations (p-value<0.05) between  genotypes and European League Against Rheumatism (EULAR) treatment responses.  False Discovery Rate corrections for multiple testing (q-value) and stratified  analyses were performed to investigate association with individual therapies and  IgM-rheumatoid factor (RF) status. RESULTS: Six of twenty successfully genotyped polymorphisms were nominally  associated with EULAR treatment response. Three of these were in weak to  moderate linkage disequilibrium with polymorphisms previously reported  associated with anti-TNF treatment response. TLR5(rs5744174) variant allele  carriers (odds ratio(OR) = 1.7(1.1-2.5),p = 0.010,q = 0.46) and TLR1(rs4833095)  homozygous variant carriers (OR = 2.8(1.1-7.4),p = 0.037,q = 0.46) had higher  odds for a positive treatment response. NLRP3(rs10754558) variant allele  carriers (odds ratio(OR) = 0.6(0.4-1.0),p = 0.045,q = 0.46) were more likely to  have a negative treatment response. The association in TLR5(rs5744174) remained  significant after correction for multiple comparisons among patients negative  for RF (OR = 6.2(2.4-16.3),p = 0.0002,q = 0.024). No other association withstood  correction for multiple testing. Post hoc analyses showed that change in Patient  Global score on a visual analogue scale (VAS) and change in pain VAS were the  main factors responsible for the association. CONCLUSIONS: We reproduced previously reported associations between genetic  variation in the TLR10/1/6 gene cluster, TLR5, and NLRP3 loci and response to  anti-TNF treatment in RA. Changes in VAS pain and patient global scores were the  main contributors to the association found for TLR5.

Using the BLAST  search strategy, homologues for reviewed non-human mammalian proteins with  protein evidence were identified for 90 ""missing"" proteins while another 38 had  reviewed non-human mammalian homologues. Putative functional annotations were  assigned to 27 of the remaining 43 novel proteins.

33,Which syndromes are associated with heterochromia iridum?,"[""We present the genetic analyses conducted on a three-generation family (14  individuals) with three members affected with isolated-Hirschsprung disease  (HSCR) and one with HSCR and heterochromia iridum (syndromic-HSCR), a phenotype  reminiscent of Waardenburg-Shah syndrome (WS4). WS4 is characterized by  pigmentary abnormalities of the skin, eyes and/or hair, sensorineural deafness  and HSCR. None of the members had sensorineural deafness. The family was  screened for copy number variations (CNVs) using Illumina-HumanOmni2.5-Beadchip  and for coding sequence mutations in WS4 genes (EDN3, EDNRB, or SOX10) and in  the main HSCR gene (RET). Confocal microscopy and immunoblotting were used to  assess the functional impact of the mutations. A heterozygous A/G transition in  EDNRB was identified in 4 affected and 3 unaffected individuals. While in EDNRB  isoforms 1 and 2 (cellular receptor) the transition results in the abolishment  of translation initiation (M1V), in isoform 3 (only in the cytosol) the  replacement occurs at Met91 (M91V) and is predicted benign. Another heterozygous  transition (c.-248G/A; -predicted to affect translation efficiency-) in the  5'-untranslated region of EDN3 (EDNRB ligand) was detected in all affected  individuals but not in healthy carriers of the EDNRB mutation. Also, a de novo  CNVs encompassing DACH1 was identified in the patient with heterochromia iridum  and HSCR Since the EDNRB and EDN3 variants only coexist in affected individuals,  HSCR could be due to the joint effect of mutations in genes of the same pathway.

Bardet-Biedl syndrome is genetically heterogeneous with three  cloned genes ( BBS2, BBS4, and MKKS) and at least three other known loci ( BBS1,  BBS3, and BBS5). Both McKusick-Kaufman syndrome and Bardet-Biedl syndrome are  inherited in an autosomal recessive pattern, and both syndromes are caused by  mutations in the MKKS gene. However, mutations in MKKS are found in only 4%-11%  of unselected Bardet-Biedl syndrome patients. We hypothesized that an analysis  of patients with atypical Bardet-Biedl syndrome and McKusick-Kaufman syndrome  (Group I; 15 probands) and patients with Bardet-Biedl syndrome who had linkage  results inconsistent with linkage to the other loci (Group II; 12 probands)  could increase the MKKS mutation yield. Both mutant alleles were identified in  only two families in Group II. Single (heterozygous) sequence variations were  found in three Group I families and in two Group II families. Combining these  results with previously published data showed that only one mutant allele was  detected in nearly half of all patients screened to date, suggesting that  unusual mutational mechanisms or patterns of inheritance may be involved.  However, sequencing of the BBS2 gene in these patients did not provide any  evidence of digenic or ""triallelic"" inheritance. The frequency of detected  mutations in MKKS in Group II patients was 24%, i.e., six times higher than the  published rate for unselected BBS patients, suggesting that small-scale linkage  analyses may be useful in suitable families.', 'The heterogeneous group of disorders known as oculocutaneous albinism (OCA)  shares cutaneous and ocular hypopigmentation associated with common  developmental abnormalities of the eye.

The OCA phenotype is dependent on the constitutional pigmentation  background of the family, with more OCA pigmentation found in families with  darker constitutional pigmentation, which indicates that other genes may modify  the OCA phenotype. Sequence variation in the melanocortin-1 receptor (MC1R) gene  is associated with red hair in the normal population, but red hair is unusual in  OCA. We identified eight probands with OCA who had red hair at birth.

34,List the components of mTOR Complex 2 (mTORC2).,"['Tuberous sclerosis complex 1 (TSC1) and TSC2 are suppressors of mechanistic  target of rapamycin (mTOR). mTOR is the major component of two protein  complexes: mTOR complex 1 (mTORC1) and mTORC2. Inactive mutation of either TSC1  or TSC2 unleashes mTOR signaling and consequently causes TSC, a benign tumor  syndrome affecting multiple organs. We report here that expression of  αB-crystallin was upregulated in Tsc1-/- or Tsc2-/- mouse embryonic fibroblasts,  Eker rat uterine leiomyoma-derived Tsc2-deficient ELT3 cells, mutant  Tsc2-associated mouse kidney tumors, and human lung lymphangioleiomyomatosis  nodules. αB-crystallin was transcriptionally activated by mTOR complex 2  (mTORC2): nuclear factor-kappa B (NFκB) signaling cascade. The augmented  αB-crystallin was critical for the migration, invasion and apoptotic resistance  of Tsc2-defective cells. Disruption of αB-crystallin suppressed Tsc2-null cell  proliferation and tumorigenesis. Therefore, enhanced αB-crystallin has an  essential role in TSC1/2 complex deficiency-mediated tumorigenesis, and  inhibition of αB-crystallin may complement the current therapy for TSC.', 'mTOR complex 2 (mTORC2) signaling is upregulated in multiple types of human  cancer, but the molecular mechanisms underlying its activation and regulation  remain elusive. Here, we show that microRNA-mediated upregulation of Rictor, an  mTORC2-specific component, contributes to tumor progression. Rictor is  upregulated via the repression of the miR-424/503 cluster in human prostate and  colon cancer cell lines that harbor c-Src upregulation and in Src-transformed  cells. The tumorigenicity and invasive activity of these cells were suppressed  by re-expression of miR-424/503. Rictor upregulation promotes formation of  mTORC2 and induces activation of mTORC2, resulting in promotion of tumor growth  and invasion. Furthermore, downregulation of miR-424/503 is associated with  Rictor upregulation in colon cancer tissues. These findings suggest that the  miR-424/503-Rictor pathway plays a crucial role in tumor progression.', 'Mammalian Sin1 plays key roles in the regulation of mitogen-activated protein  kinase (MAPK) and mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR) signaling. Sin1 is an  essential component of mTOR complex 2 (mTORC2). The functions of Sin1 and mTORC2  remain largely unknown in T cells. Here, we investigate Sin1 function in T cells  using mice that lack Sin1 in the hematopoietic system. Sin1 deficiency blocks  the mTORC2-dependent Akt phosphorylation in T cells during development and  activation. Sin1-deficient T cells exhibit normal thymic cellularity and  percentages of double-negative, double-positive, and single-positive CD4(+) and  CD8(+) thymocytes. Sin1 deficiency does not impair T-cell receptor (TCR) induced  growth and proliferation. Sin1 appears dispensable for in vitro CD4(+) helper  cell differentiation. However, Sin1 deficiency results in an increased  proportion of Foxp3(+) natural T-regulatory (nTreg) cells in the thymus. The  TGF-β-dependent differentiation of CD4(+) T cells in vitro is enhanced by the  inhibition of mTOR but not by loss of Sin1 function. Our results reveal that  Sin1 and mTORC2 are dispensable for the development and activation of T cells  but play a role in nTreg-cell differentiation.', 'Tuberous sclerosis complex (TSC) is a multisystem genetic disorder with severe  neurologic manifestations, including epilepsy, autism, anxiety and attention  deficit hyperactivity disorder. TSC is caused by the loss of either the TSC1 or  TSC2 genes that normally regulate the mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR)  kinase. mTOR exists within two distinct complexes, mTOR complex 1 (mTORC1) and  mTOR complex 2 (mTORC2). Loss of either TSC gene leads to increased mTORC1 but  decreased mTORC2 signaling. As the contribution of decreased mTORC2 signaling to  neural development and homeostasis has not been well studied, we generated a  conditional knockout (CKO) of Rictor, a key component of mTORC2. mTORC2  signaling is impaired in the brain, whereas mTORC1 signaling is unchanged.  Rictor CKO mice have small brains and bodies, normal lifespan and are fertile.  Cortical layering is normal, but neurons are smaller than those in control  brains. Seizures were not observed, although excessive slow activity was seen on  electroencephalography. Rictor CKO mice are hyperactive and have reduced  anxiety-like behavior. Finally, there is decreased white matter and increased  levels of monoamine neurotransmitters in the cerebral cortex. Loss of mTORC2  signaling in the cortex independent of mTORC1 can disrupt normal brain  development and function and may contribute to some of the neurologic  manifestations seen in TSC.', 'When rhegmatogenous retinal detachment occurs, tumor necrosis factor-alpha  (TNF-α) among other cytokines leaks into the subretinal space, induces resident  retinal pigment epithelial (RPE) cells to migrate, which is the initial step of  proliferative vitreoretinopathy (PVR). In the current study, we aim to  understand how this is regulated by focusing the cellular mechanisms involved.  Here we identified an Akt/Tuberous sclerosis protein 2 (TSC2)/mTOR complex1  (mTORC1) signaling pathway after TNF-α treatment to mediate RPE cell migration.  Suppression of mTORC1 activation, either by its inhibitor rapamycin, or by  activation of its suppressor AMP activated protein kinase (AMPK), inhibited  TNF-α-mediated RPE cell migration, while RNA interference (RNAi)-mediated  knocking-down of SIN1 or Rictor, two key components of mTOR complex 2 (mTORC2),  had no significant effect on TNF-α-induced RPE cell migration. Our data provide  initial evidence that TNF-α-mediated in vitro RPE cell migration mainly requires  Akt/mTORC1, but not mTORC2 signaling. The results of this study may lead to  indentify novel signaling targets against PVR.', 'Tuberous sclerosis complex (TSC) is a genetic disease caused by a mutation in  either the tsc1 or tsc2 tumor suppressor gene. Recent studies have demonstrated  that TSC2 displays GAP (GTPase-activating protein) activity specifically towards  the small G protein Rheb and inhibits its ability to stimulate the mTOR  signaling pathway. Rheb and TSC2 comprise a unique pair of GTPase and GAP,  because Rheb has high basal GTP levels and TSC2 does not have the catalytic  arginine finger found in Ras-GAP. To investigate the function of TSC2 and Rheb  in mTOR signaling, we analyzed the TSC2-stimulated Rheb GTPase activity. We  found that Arg15, a residue equivalent to Gly12 in Ras, is important for Rheb to  function as a substrate for TSC2 GAP. In addition, we identified asparagine  residues essential for TSC2 GAP activity. We demonstrated a novel catalytic  mechanism of the TSC2 GAP and Rheb that TSC2 uses a catalytic ""asparagine thumb""  instead of the arginine finger found in Ras-GAP. Furthermore, we discovered that  farnesylation and membrane localization of Rheb is not essential for Rheb to  stimulate S6 kinase (S6K) phosphorylation. Analysis of TSC1 binding defective  mutants of TSC2 shows that TSC1 is not required for the TSC2 GAP activity but  may function as a regulatory component in the TSC1/TSC2 complex. Our data  further demonstrate that GAP activity is essential for the cellular function of  TSC2 to inhibit S6K phosphorylation.', 'Mutations in either the TSC1 or TSC2 tumor suppressor gene are responsible for  Tuberous Sclerosis Complex. The gene products of TSC1 and TSC2 form a functional  complex and inhibit the phosphorylation of S6K and 4EBP1, two key regulators of  translation. Here, we describe that TSC2 is regulated by cellular energy levels  and plays an essential role in the cellular energy response pathway. Under  energy starvation conditions, the AMP-activated protein kinase (AMPK)  phosphorylates TSC2 and enhances its activity. Phosphorylation of TSC2 by AMPK  is required for translation regulation and cell size control in response to  energy deprivation. Furthermore, TSC2 and its phosphorylation by AMPK protect  cells from energy deprivation-induced apoptosis. These observations demonstrate  a model where TSC2 functions as a key player in regulation of the common mTOR  pathway of protein synthesis, cell growth, and viability in response to cellular  energy levels.', ""The mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR) is part of two distinct complexes,  mTORC1, containing raptor and mLST8, and mTORC2, containing rictor, mLST8 and  sin1. Although great endeavors have already been made to elucidate the function  and regulation of mTOR, the cytoplasmic nuclear distribution of the mTOR  complexes is unknown. Upon establishment of the proper experimental conditions,  we found mTOR, mLST8, rictor and sin1 to be less abundant in the nucleus than in  the cytoplasm of non-transformed, non-immortalized, diploid human primary  fibroblasts. Although raptor is also high abundant in the nucleus, the  mTOR/raptor complex is predominantly cytoplasmic, whereas the mTOR/rictor  complex is abundant in both compartments. Rapamycin negatively regulates the  formation of both mTOR complexes, but the molecular mechanism of its effects on  mTORC2 remained elusive. We describe that in primary cells short-term treatment  with rapamycin triggers dephosphorylation of rictor and sin1 exclusively in the  cytoplasm, but does not affect mTORC2 assembly. Prolonged drug treatment leads  to complete dephosphorylation and cytoplasmic translocation of nuclear rictor  and sin1 accompanied by inhibition of mTORC2 assembly. The distinct cytoplasmic  and nuclear upstream and downstream effectors of mTOR are involved in many  cancers and human genetic diseases, such as tuberous sclerosis, Peutz-Jeghers  syndrome, von Hippel-Lindau disease, neurofibromatosis type 1, polycystic kidney  disease, Alzheimer's disease, cardiac hypertrophy, obesity and diabetes.  Accordingly, analogs of rapamycin are currently tested in many different  clinical trials.

Hamartin (encoded by TSC1) and  S6K was expressed in all samples. Tuberin (TSC2) was weak or absent in  angiomyolipomas, but present in healthy kidney, whereas, phosphorylated p70 S6  kinase and p56 were present only in angiomyolipomas. Our results indicate  activation of a mammalian target of rapamycin metabolic pathway in tuberous  sclerosis lesions, which contributes to their growth. We suggest that treatment  with rapamycin and its analogues could benefit such patients.', 'Protein synthesis regulation via mammalian target of rapamycin complex 1  (mTORC1) signaling pathway has key roles in neural development and function, and  its dysregulation is involved in neurodevelopmental disorders associated with  autism and intellectual disability. mTOR regulates assembly of the translation  initiation machinery by interacting with the eukaryotic initiation factor eIF3  complex and by controlling phosphorylation of key translational regulators.  Collybistin (CB), a neuron-specific Rho-GEF responsible for X-linked  intellectual disability with epilepsy, also interacts with eIF3, and its binding  partner gephyrin associates with mTOR. Therefore, we hypothesized that CB also  binds mTOR and affects mTORC1 signaling activity in neuronal cells. Here, by  using induced pluripotent stem cell-derived neural progenitor cells from a male  patient with a deletion of entire CB gene and from control individuals, as well  as a heterologous expression system, we describe that CB physically interacts  with mTOR and inhibits mTORC1 signaling pathway and protein synthesis. These  findings suggest that disinhibited mTORC1 signaling may also contribute to the  pathological process in patients with loss-of-function variants in CB.']","Mammalian target of rapamycin complex 2 (mTORC2) is a kinase complex comprised of mTOR, Rictor, mSin1, mLST8/GβL and PRR5."
35,What is known about prostate cancer screening in the UK ?,"[""OBJECTIVE: To evaluate the psychosocial impact of participation in a  population-based prostate-specific antigen (PSA) testing programme, akin to  screening, and to explore the relationship between urinary symptoms reported  before PSA testing and the response to the subsequent PSA result. PATIENTS AND METHODS: This prospective questionnaire study was nested within the  case-finding component of the ProtecT (prostate testing for cancer and  treatment) feasibility study (ISRCTN20141297). Men aged 50-69 years from 18  general practices in three cities in the UK completed the Hospital Anxiety and  Depression Scale (HADS), the Short Form-12 (SF-12) Health Survey, and the  International Continence Society 'male' (ICSmale) questionnaires before giving  consent for a PSA test in a community clinic (baseline). Men with an 'abnormal'  PSA result returned for further investigation (including biopsy) and repeated  these questionnaires before biopsy. RESULTS: At baseline, study participants had similar levels of anxiety and  depression to the general male population. There was no increase in the HADS  scores, or reduction in the SF-12 mental health component summary score, on  attendance at the biopsy clinic after receiving an 'abnormal' PSA result.  Urinary symptoms were associated with levels of anxiety and depression before  receiving a PSA result (baseline), but were not associated with anxiety and  depression at biopsy independently of baseline scores. Therefore changes in  anxiety or depression at biopsy did not appear to differ between those with and  without urinary symptoms. CONCLUSIONS: This study confirms the findings of other studies that the  deleterious effects of receiving an abnormal PSA result during population  screening are not identified by generic health-status questionnaires.  Comparisons with outcomes of studies measuring cancer-specific distress and  using qualitative research methods raise the question of whether a prostate  cancer screening-specific instrument is required. However, a standardized  measure of anxiety identified differences at baseline between those who did and  did not report urinary symptoms. These findings suggest that it might be  advisable to better inform men undergoing PSA testing about the uncertain  relationship between urinary symptoms and prostate cancer, to minimize baseline  levels of psychological distress."", ""INTRODUCTION: Screening for prostate cancer with serum prostate specific antigen  (PSA) remains a controversial topic. The UK NHS Executive has issued extensive  guidance stressing the importance of adequate counselling prior to performing  this test. This study aims to assess men's knowledge of the PSA test at the time  of their referral and their attitude towards screening. PATIENTS AND METHODS: A total of 219 men referred to urology via the 'fast  track' prostate cancer service were recruited into the study. Of these, 191 were  referred from primary care and 28 from secondary care. All men completed a  questionnaire regarding their knowledge and expectation of the test. RESULTS: The response rate for completed questionnaires was 100%. Overall, 91  (41.5%) men were aware that their PSA had been performed prior to referral and  only 79 (36%) men understood why the test was being done. Patients referred from  secondary care appeared to be better informed. Despite these figures, 175 (80%)  men said they would recommend PSA testing to a friend or colleague, and 196  (89%) men said the test should be broadly publicised. CONCLUSIONS: Nearly two-thirds of the men referred to urology with an elevated  PSA were unaware that they had even had their PSA done. Information about the  limitations of PSA testing and the consequence of a positive test result had  been deficient. Informed counselling for the PSA test should form part of the  consultation of any physician intending to undertake this test whether for lower  urinary tract symptoms or for prostate cancer screening."", 'We used a nested case-control design on data from men in four prospective  studies (from the UK, Maryland in the USA, and two from Finland) with available  stored serum samples to determine whether there was an advantage in measuring  both free prostate-specific antigen (PSA) and total PSA as a potential screening  test for prostate cancer. Of these men, 247 were verified through national vital  statistics offices as having died of prostate cancer, or having developed the  disease, and 953 men who did not develop prostate cancer (controls) were  selected, matched to cases for age, study centre and sample storage duration.  Fixing the false-positive rate at 1%, the prostate cancer detection rate  (sensitivity) over the 3 years following serum collection (based on 14 cancers)  increased from an estimated 95% using total PSA to 97% using free and bound PSA  (that is, bound to alpha-antichymotrypsin which together with the free form is  total PSA). Over a 6-year period (based on 41 cancers) a similar difference  occurred (52% and 56% detection rates respectively).

We  know what decision aids achieve in randomized controlled trials (RCTs), but we  still know very little about how they are used and how this relates to the  informed decision making outcome measures. OBJECTIVE: To examine men's use of an online decision aid for prostate cancer  screening using website transaction log files (web-logs), and to examine  associations between usage and components of informed decision making. METHODS: We conducted an observational web-log analysis of users of an online  decision aid, Prosdex. Men between 50 and 75 years of age were recruited for an  associated RCT from 26 general practices across South Wales, United Kingdom. Men  allocated to one arm of the RCT were included in the current study. Time and  usage data were derived from website log files. Components of informed decision  making were measured by an online questionnaire. RESULTS: Available for analysis were 82 web-logs. Overall, there was large  variation in the use of Prosdex. The mean total time spent on the site was 20  minutes. The mean number of pages accessed was 32 (SD 21) out of a possible 60  pages. Significant associations were found between increased usage and increased  knowledge (Spearman rank correlation [rho] = 0.69, P < .01), between increased  usage and less favorable attitude towards PSA testing (rho = -0.52, P < .01),  and between increased usage and reduced intention to undergo PSA testing (rho =  -0.44, P < .01). A bimodal distribution identified two types of user: low access  and high access users. CONCLUSIONS: Increased usage of Prosdex leads to more informed decision making,  the key aim of the UK Prostate Cancer Risk Management Programme. However,  developers realistically have roughly 20 minutes to provide useful information  that will support informed decision making when the patient uses a web-based  interface. Future decision aids need to be developed with this limitation in  mind. We recommend that web-log analysis should be an integral part of online  decision aid development and analysis. TRIAL REGISTRATION: ISRCTN48473735;  http://www.controlled-trials.com/ISRCTN48473735 (Archived by WebCite at  http://www.webcitation.org/5pqeF89tS)."", ""OBJECTIVE: To explore the concerns and worries in men with uncomplicated lower  urinary tract symptoms (LUTS, but no evidence of prostate cancer) relating to  their symptoms. PATIENTS AND METHODS: There is no current prostate cancer screening programme in  the UK. Evidence suggests that men with LUTS have the same risk of prostate  cancer as aged-matched asymptomatic men. However, most men with LUTS are  'screened' with a digital rectal examination (DRE) and prostate specific antigen  (PSA) testing as part of routine assessment. Whether this screening offers any  benefit to patients and whether national screening for prostate cancer and  subsequent early treatment offer any long-term survival or quality of life  benefit is uncertain. Thus 30 men with uncomplicated LUTS were qualitatively  interviewed to explore their concerns and worries about their symptoms.  Interviews were transcribed verbatim and subjected to content analysis using  validated techniques. RESULTS: Of the 30 men, 22 (73%) expressed a fear of prostate cancer at the time  of their initial presentation. This fear was independent of race, social class  and symptom severity; older men were less worried. Of the 22, 15 (68%) stated  that after reassurance their symptoms were less bothersome and easier to cope  with. CONCLUSIONS: These findings suggest there is a considerable gain in health by  explicitly addressing the concerns of prostate cancer in men with uncomplicated  LUTS. Informing these men of their true risk of prostate cancer (before or after  a DRE and PSA estimate) may alleviate much of the bother associated with their  symptoms.

RESULTS: Without screening 2378 men per 100,000 were predicted to be diagnosed  with prostate cancer compared with 4956 men after screening at 4-year intervals.  By introducing screening, the costs would increase with 100% to 60,695,000 euro.  Overdetection is related to 39% of total costs (23,669,000 euro). Screening  until age 75 is relatively most expensive because of the costs of overtreatment. CONCLUSION: Introduction of PSA screening will increase total healthcare costs  for prostate cancer substantially, of which the actual screening costs will be a  small part.', 'We used a nested case-control design on data from men in four prospective  studies (from the UK, Maryland in the USA, and two from Finland) with available  stored serum samples to determine whether there was an advantage in measuring  both free prostate-specific antigen (PSA) and total PSA as a potential screening  test for prostate cancer.

In 2005, a first communication was targeted  to the male public and identified the reasons for the fatalistic attitude of  men, and paradoxically, why the prostate incarnates the vulnerability of their  sexual capital. As part of a second phase, this article presents the results of  a complementary study conducted among general practitioners to identify their  expectations and the most appropriate levers to promote screening. MATERIAL AND METHOD: The Ipsos survey company developed a Krisis qualitative  protocol in October 2005 (after the first French prostate day on 15 September  2005). Three groups of general practitioners were defined: doctors who are very  active in terms of screening, doctors who are uncomfortable with this problem  and doctors who systematically refer their patients to urologists. RESULTS: The management of prostate diseases often highlights the ageing process  for the patient. The ability to discuss these problems during the consultation  depended on the doctor's degree of comfort with this subject, which is related  to his/her training and relationships with urologists. To initiate the question  of screening, general practitioners involved in this process asked simple  questions about everyday practices without being afraid of making jokes or  basing their approach on mediatization of the disease. Digital rectal  examination is one of the important clinical elements but is not always easy to  perform. PSA was found to be an examination that is not always appropriate,  characterized by a lack of information on the conditions for ordering this test,  its usefulness and its relevance for screening. Ultrasound could be a way of  alerting the patient without dramatizing the situation, letting the urologist  perform digital rectal examination. Female general practitioners preferred PSA  and ultrasound. The doctors surveyed relied on mediatization of prostate  diseases, a high level of interactivity with urologists and documents and  brochures to be placed in waiting rooms to relay screening messages. CONCLUSION: General practitioners need their authorities, specialists and public  health institutions to develop and mediatize andrology in the same way as  gynaecology. Urologists play a major supportive role by means of conferences,  postgraduate training or AFU invitations."", 'OBJECTIVES: To evaluate the relevance of demographic, physician, and  psychological characteristics to PSA screening in ethnic subpopulations and  ascertain whether the same characteristics distinguish men who have never had a  PSA from those who screen infrequently and those who screen yearly (adhere). DESIGN AND METHODS: Stratified cluster-sampling was used to recruit 533 men  (45-70 years) from four ethnic groups: African-American; European-American;  immigrant Jamaican; and immigrant men from Trinidad and Tobago. Men provided  demographic and structural (insurance, regular physician, annual exam, and  physician recommendation), cognitive (risk and efficacy perceptions, knowledge),  and emotional variables (cancer worry and embarrassment), and reported on PSA  screening history. Multinomial logistic regression used these variables to  predict three screening classifications (never screened, partially adherent, and  adherent). RESULTS: Multinomial logistic regression showed that minority men were less  likely to report either never screening or yearly screening, while younger men  were more likely. Lack of a regular physician (OR=2.87, 95% CI 1.39-5.84), an  annual exam (OR=1.73, 95% CI 0.91-3.28), and low recommendation (OR=3.76, 95% CI  2.13-6.66) were associated with being categorized as a never (vs. partially  adherent) screener, but only annual exam (OR=0.26, 95% CI 0.10-0.63) was  associated with yearly screening. Lower cancer worry was marginally associated  with never screening (OR=0.59, 95% CI 0.38-1.04), while knowledge was associated  with screening yearly over time (OR=0.46, 95% CI 0.28-0.77). CONCLUSIONS: Demographic, physician, and psychological variables are  differentially associated with never, less than yearly, and yearly screening  classifications. Minority men were unlikely to have never screened, but were  also less likely to screen yearly. Physician variables were associated with the  difference between not screening and partially adherent, but not between  partially adherent and yearly screening suggesting that the role of physicians  in PSA behaviour over time would benefit from further study.', 'OBJECTIVE: To evaluate the role of targeted prostate cancer screening in men  with BRCA1 or BRCA2 mutations, an international study, IMPACT (Identification of  Men with a genetic predisposition to ProstAte Cancer: Targeted screening in  BRCA1/2 mutation carriers and controls), was established. This is the first  multicentre screening study targeted at men with a known genetic predisposition  to prostate cancer. A preliminary analysis of the data is reported. PATIENTS AND METHODS: Men aged 40-69 years from families with BRCA1 or BRCA2  mutations were offered annual prostate specific antigen (PSA) testing, and those  with PSA > 3 ng/mL, were offered a prostate biopsy. Controls were men  age-matched (± 5 years) who were negative for the familial mutation. RESULTS: In total, 300 men were recruited (205 mutation carriers; 89 BRCA1, 116  BRCA2 and 95 controls) over 33 months. At the baseline screen (year 1), 7.0%  (21/300) underwent a prostate biopsy. Prostate cancer was diagnosed in ten  individuals, a prevalence of 3.3%. The positive predictive value of PSA  screening in this cohort was 47·6% (10/21). One prostate cancer was diagnosed at  year 2. Of the 11 prostate cancers diagnosed, nine were in mutation carriers,  two in controls, and eight were clinically significant. CONCLUSIONS: The present study shows that the positive predictive value of PSA  screening in BRCA mutation carriers is high and that screening detects  clinically significant prostate cancer. These results support the rationale for  continued screening in such men.']","There is still no national screening programme established in the UK. Prostate cancer screening of asymptomatic men is not recommended by the National Screening Council at present and is not encouraged in the NHS. However, PSA tests are being performed for prostate cancer screening. The CAP and ProtecT trials are aimed to evaluate prostate cancer screening in the UK."
36,Is selenium deficiency involved in autoimmune thyroid disease?,"['The trace element selenium is an essential micronutrient that is required for  the biosynthesis of selenocysteine-containing selenoproteins. Most of the known  selenoproteins are expressed in the thyroid gland, including some with still  unknown functions. Among the well-characterized selenoproteins are the  iodothyronine deiodinases, glutathione peroxidases and thioredoxin reductases,  enzymes involved in thyroid hormone metabolism, regulation of redox state and  protection from oxidative damage. Selenium content in selenium-sensitive tissues  such as the liver, kidney or muscle and expression of nonessential  selenoproteins, such as the glutathione peroxidases GPx1 and GPx3, is controlled  by nutritional supply. The thyroid gland is, however, largely independent from  dietary selenium intake and thyroid selenoproteins are preferentially expressed.  As a consequence, no explicit effects on thyroid hormone profiles are observed  in healthy individuals undergoing selenium supplementation. However, low  selenium status correlates with risk of goiter and multiple nodules in European  women. Some clinical studies have demonstrated that selenium-deficient patients  with autoimmune thyroid disease benefit from selenium supplementation, although  the data are conflicting and many parameters must still be defined. The baseline  selenium status of an individual could constitute the most important parameter  modifying the outcome of selenium supplementation, which might primarily disrupt  self-amplifying cycles of the endocrine-immune system interface rectifying the  interaction of lymphocytes with thyroid autoantigens. Selenium deficiency is  likely to constitute a risk factor for a feedforward derangement of the immune  system-thyroid interaction, while selenium supplementation appears to dampen the  self-amplifying nature of this derailed interaction.', ""It is well known that selenium plays a fundamental role in regulating thyroid  and other functions of the human body like reproduction, autoimmunity, glucose  metabolism or bone metabolism. While for thyroid function investigation,  radioimmunoassays and radioimmunometric assays both key techniques of nuclear  medicine are used, for selenium measurements atomic absorption spectrometry is  the method of choice. Normal thyroid gland retains high selenium concentrations  even under conditions of inadequate selenium supply and expresses many of the  known selenocysteine-containing proteins. Adequate selenium nutrition supports  efficient thyroid hormone synthesis and metabolism and protects the thyroid  gland damage by excessive iodide exposure. In regions where a combined severe  iodine and selenium deficiency exist, normalization of iodine supply is  mandatory before initiation of selenium supplementation in order to prevent  hypothyroidism. Selenium deficiency and disturbed thyroid function may develop  under conditions of special dietary regimens, such as long-term total parenteral  nutrition or after inadequate nutrition in children. Some investigators suggest  that selenium may be a useful adjunctive treatment for autoimmune thyroid  diseases, such as Hashimoto and Graves' disease. Low serum selenium levels have  been associated with higher incidence of thyroid cancer, as well as with chronic  illness or lomicronw triiodothyronine syndrome. These biological actions are  mediated through the expression of selenoproteins, the most important being the  glutathione peroxidases, the iodothyronine deiodinases, the thioredoxine  reductase and the selenoprotein P. Selenium is also associated with animal  proteins. Subsequently meats and seafood are dietary sources of selenium. The  ingestion of large quantities of selenium may have adverse effects. It has been  shown that dietary intake of about 300 micro g of selenium daily may have a  toxic effect on growth hormone and insulin like growth factor-1 metabolism, as  well as in the synthesis of thyroid hormones. Main adverse effects may be  anorexia, diarrhea, depression, hemorrhage, liver and kidney necrosis,  blindness, ataxia and respiratory disturbances. Dermatitis and CNS deficiency  have also been described. It is concluded that selenium plays an important role  in regulating thyroid function, as well as in the homeostasis of thyroid  hormones through the action of selenoproteins, in which it incorporates as  selenocystein."", 'High prevalence of hyperplastic and autoimmune diseases of thyroid in Ukrainian  population is determined by endemic deficit of iodine and selenium. The aim of  this research was to assess the place of biologically-active additions on the  basis of herbal material containing an iodine and selenium in prophylaxis and  treatment of thyroid pathology. During the six month period 55 patients received  herbal preparation Alba twice a day. The levels of TSH, volume of thyroid, the  sizes of nodular goiter (ultrasound investigation) were measured before and at  the end of the investigation. The levels of thyroid stimulating antibodies to  TSH receptor (AB-r TSH) were evaluated in patients with hyperthyroidism. The  results of Alba application showed that in patients with thyroid pathology  (diffuse nontoxic goiter, hyperthyroidism and chronic thyroiditis) it was  possible to reduce the volume of thyroid, normalize its function, and decrease  the level of AB-r TSH in diffuse toxic goiter. We also found approximately 20 %  shortening of the time needed to get target level of TSH and finally the  duration of treatment of thyrotoxicosis.', ""Genetic factors play an important role in the pathogenesis of autoimmune thyroid  disease (AITD) and it has been calculated that 80% of the susceptibility to  develop Graves' disease is attributable to genes. The concordance rate for AITD  among monozygotic twins is, however, well below 1 and environmental factors thus  must play an important role. We have attempted to carry out a comprehensive  review of all the environmental and hormonal risk factors thought to bring about  AITD in genetically predisposed individuals. Low birth weight, iodine excess and  deficiency, selenium deficiency, parity, oral contraceptive use, reproductive  span, fetal microchimerism, stress, seasonal variation, allergy, smoking,  radiation damage to the thyroid gland, viral and bacterial infections all play a  role in the development of autoimmune thyroid disorders. The use of certain  drugs (lithium, interferon-alpha, Campath-1H) also increases the risk of the  development of autoimmunity against the thyroid gland. Further research is  warranted into the importance of fetal microchimerism and of viral infections  capable of mounting an endogenous interferon-alpha response."", ""CONTEXT: Selenium deficiency may play an important role in the initiation and  progression of autoimmune thyroid disease. OBJECTIVE: To compare serum selenium (s-Se) values in patients with newly  diagnosed autoimmune thyroid disease and controls from the Danish population. DESIGN AND SETTINGS: S-Se was measured in triplicate by a fluorimetric method. PARTICIPANTS: Patients with newly diagnosed Graves' disease (GD) (n\xa0=\xa097) or  autoimmune overt hypothyroidism (AIH) (n\xa0=\xa096), euthyroid subjects with high  serum levels of thyroid peroxidase antibody (TPO-Ab) (TPO-Ab >\xa01500\xa0U/ml,  n\xa0=\xa092) and random controls (n\xa0=\xa0830). MAIN OUTCOME MEASURE: Differences in s-Se values. RESULTS: S-Se was lower in patients with GD than in controls (mean (SD), GD:  89·9\xa0μg/l (18·4); controls: 98·8\xa0μg/l (19·7), P\xa0<\xa00·01). This was confirmed in a  multivariate logistic regression model adjusting for age, sex, mineral  supplements, smoking, geographical region and time of sampling (P\xa0<\xa00·01). In a  linear model, s-Se was similar in patients with AIH (mean (SD): 98·4\xa0μg/l  (24·9)) and in controls (P\xa0=\xa00·86). In the multivariate model however, s-Se was  marginally lower in patients with AIH compared to controls (P\xa0=\xa00·04). There was  no significant difference in s-Se between euthyroid participants with high  TPO-Ab and random controls (linear: P\xa0=\xa00·97; multivariate: P\xa0=\xa00·27). CONCLUSION: Patients with newly diagnosed GD and AIH had significantly lower  s-Se compared with random controls. Our observation supports the postulated link  between inadequate selenium supply and overt autoimmune thyroid disease,  especially GD."", ""Prostate cancer (PC) is the most common cancer in men and a leading cause of  cancer death. Prostatic gland accumulates reasonably high amount of selenium  (Se), the element that prevents the development of PC. It is hypothesized that  some selenoproteins inhibit the transformation of normal prostate epithelium  into neoplasm. We studied Se levels in whole blood, plasma and prostate of 32 PC  and 40 benign prostate hyperplasia (BPH) patients and in the control group  composed of 39 healthy subjects. The selenoenzyme glutathione peroxidase  (GSH-Px) was also measured in the patients' red cells, plasma and prostate  tissue. Se concentration in whole blood and plasma in both groups of patients  was lower as compared with controls, while in prostate gland it was  significantly higher in PC than in BPH patients and controls. Red cell GSH-Px  activity was the same in PC patients and controls but significantly lower in BPH  patients. Plasma GSH-Px activity was significantly lower in PC patients than in  the control group, and prostate GSH-Px activity was significantly lower in PC  patients as compared with BPH patients. Since Se has anticancer properties, it  is very likely that its low level in blood may facilitate the development of  cancer. A higher level of Se in prostate of PC patients has no influence on  GSH-Px activity in the gland."", 'BACKGROUND/OBJECTIVES: Selenium was thought to have a role in cardiovascular  disease (CVD) owing to its antioxidant properties; however, evidence from  observational studies and randomized controlled trials (RCTs) has been  inconsistent and controversial. We thus conducted a meta-analysis to assess the  discrepancies between observational and randomized trial evidence. SUBJECTS/METHODS: We searched MEDLINE and EMBASE for eligible prospective  studies regarding the relationship between selenium and CVD up to 15 December  2013 and finally included 16 prospective observational studies and 16 RCTs.  Random effects model was used to estimate the pooled relative risk (RR).  Generalized least-squares trend test and restricted cubic spline model were  performed to assess a linear and a nonlinear dose-response relationship. RESULTS: Our meta-analysis of prospective studies showed a nonlinear  relationship of CVD risk with blood selenium concentrations across a range of  30-165\u2009μg/l and a significant benefit of CVD within a narrow selenium range of  55-145\u2009μg/l. Our meta-analyses of RCTs showed that oral selenium supplements  (median dose: 200\u2009μg/day) for 2 weeks to 144 months significantly raised the  blood selenium concentrations by 56.4\u2009μg/l (95% confidence interval (CI): 40.9,  72.0\u2009μg/l), whereas oral selenium supplements (median: 100\u2009μg/day) for 6 to 114  months caused no effect on CVD (RR=0.91; 95% CI: 0.74, 1.10). CONCLUSIONS: Our meta-analysis in prospective studies demonstrated a significant  inverse association between selenium status and CVD risk within a narrow  selenium range and a null effect of selenium supplementation on CVD was observed  in RCTs. These findings indicate the importance of considering selenium status,  dose and safety in health assessment and future study design.', ""Mammalian selenium-containing proteins identified thus far contain selenium in  the form of a selenocysteine residue encoded by UGA. These proteins lack common  amino acid sequence motifs, but 3'-untranslated regions of selenoprotein genes  contain a common stem-loop structure, selenocysteine insertion sequence (SECIS)  element, that is necessary for decoding UGA as selenocysteine rather than a stop  signal. We describe here a computer program, SECISearch, that identifies  mammalian selenoprotein genes by recognizing SECIS elements on the basis of  their primary and secondary structures and free energy requirements. When  SECISearch was applied to search human dbEST, two new mammalian selenoproteins,  designated SelT and SelR, were identified. We determined their cDNA sequences  and expressed them in a monkey cell line as fusion proteins with a green  fluorescent protein. Incorporation of selenium into new proteins was confirmed  by metabolic labeling with (75)Se, and expression of SelT was additionally  documented in immunoblot assays. SelT and SelR did not have homology to  previously characterized proteins, but their putative homologs were detected in  various organisms. SelR homologs were present in every organism characterized by  complete genome sequencing. The data suggest applicability of SECISearch for  identification of new selenoprotein genes in nucleotide data bases."", 'The micronutrient selenium is found in proteins as selenocysteine (Sec), the  21st amino acid cotranslationally inserted in response to a UGA codon.

However, a complete study of eukaryotic  selenoprotein synthesis has been lacking. Here, we present an analysis of  Sec-tRNA(Sec) formation in the parasitic protozoon Trypanosoma brucei in vivo.  Null mutants of either PSTK or SepSecS abolished selenoprotein synthesis,  demonstrating the essentiality of both enzymes for Sec-tRNA(Sec) formation.  Growth of the 2 knockout strains was not impaired; thus, unlike mammals,  trypanosomes do not require selenoproteins for viability. Analysis of  conditional RNAi strains showed that SerRS, selenophosphate synthase, and the  Sec-specific elongation factor, EFSec, are also essential for selenoprotein  synthesis. These results with T. brucei imply that eukaryotes have a single  pathway of Sec-tRNA(Sec) synthesis that requires Sep-tRNA(Sec) as an  intermediate.', ""Genetic factors play an important role in the pathogenesis of autoimmune thyroid  disease (AITD) and it has been calculated that 80% of the susceptibility to  develop Graves' disease is attributable to genes.

37,Is ospemifene effective for treatment of dyspareunia?,"['Vulvar and vaginal atrophy (VVA) is a chronic, progressive medical condition  prevalent among postmenopausal women, which produces symptoms such as  dyspareunia, vaginal dryness, and vaginal irritation. Currently, the only  prescription options are systemic and vaginal estrogen therapies that may be  limited by concerns about long-term safety and breast cancer risk. Ospemifene is  a tissue-selective estrogen agonist/antagonist (a selective estrogen receptor  modulator) recently approved by the US Food and Drug Administration for  treatment of dyspareunia, a symptom of VVA, due to menopause. Ospemifene, the  first nonestrogen oral treatment for this indication, may provide an alternative  to treatment with estrogen. Animal models with ospemifene suggest an inhibitory  effect on growth of malignant breast tissue, but animal data cannot necessarily  be extrapolated to humans. Clinical trials, including 3 long-term studies  assessing the overall safety of ospemifene, support that ospemifene is generally  well tolerated, with beneficial effects on the vagina, neutral effects on the  breast, and minimal effects on the endometrium.', 'IMPORTANCE OF THE FIELD: Millions of women worldwide suffer from vulvovaginal  atrophy (VVA) associated with menopause, and many women report that this  adversely affects their quality of life. Ospemifene is a non-hormonal estrogen  receptor agonist/antagonist effective in the treatment of VVA. Although similar  in structure to other estrogen receptor agonists/antagonists that have  antagonistic effects on the vagina, ospemifene has an estrogen-like effect on  vaginal epithelium. This review focuses on ospemifene including its  pharmacologic properties, clinical efficacy and safety. AREAS COVERED IN THIS REVIEW: The paper provides information on the  phamacodynamic and pharmacokinetic properties of ospemifene. It also contains an  overview of its preclinical and clinical efficacy as well as its clinical  safety. WHAT THE READER WILL GAIN: From this paper, the reader will gain an appreciation  for a new non-hormonal estrogen receptor agonist/antagonist, ospemifene. TAKE HOME MESSAGE: The pharmacologic properties of ospemifene make it a logical  candidate for the treatment of women with moderate to severe symptoms of VVA  associated with menopause. Clinical trials have confirmed that daily doses are  well-tolerated and that it is effective in normalizing vaginal maturation index  and pH as well as improving the symptoms associated with VVA including  dyspareunia.', 'OBJECTIVE: Vaginal estrogen therapy at the lowest effective dose is generally  recommended for the treatment of vulvar and vaginal atrophy (VVA), but not all  women are candidates. Selective estrogen receptor modulators (SERMs) aim to  elicit specific positive effects on targeted tissues with neutral or minimal  negative effects on other tissues. This review compares the vaginal effects of  currently available and investigational SERMs. METHODS: Relevant English-language articles published between 1980 and 2012 were  identified through the PubMed database (search string ""[Selective Estrogen  Receptor Modulator OR SERM] AND [Vulvar OR Vaginal] AND Atrophy""), article  reference lists, and EMBASE searches for individual SERMs. Both authors reviewed  all articles, which formed the basis of this narrative literature review. RESULTS: Activity profiles of SERMs in various tissues are distinct. Tamoxifen  and arzoxifene have no specific positive vaginal effects but have reported  variable or adverse gynecologic effects. Raloxifene does not improve VVA but can  be used safely in combination with vaginal estrogen. Bazedoxifene has no  demonstrated efficacy for VVA but, in combination with oral conjugated equine  estrogens, improves the signs and symptoms of VVA. SERMs with positive vaginal  effects (such as improvement in the vaginal maturation index, reduced vaginal  pH, and improvement in the signs and symptoms of VVA) on postmenopausal  symptomatic women include lasofoxifene (clinical development on hold) and  ospemifene, which was recently approved for the treatment of VVA-related  dyspareunia, with a class effect warning of potential venous thrombosis risk. CONCLUSIONS: SERMs that specifically target the pathophysiology underlying VVA  may provide an alternative to vaginal or systemic estrogen therapy.', 'Ospemifene is a selective estrogen receptor modulator (SERM), or estrogen  receptor agonist/antagonist, that was recently approved by the US Food and Drug  Administration for the treatment of dyspareunia associated with vulvar and  vaginal atrophy, a chronic condition that affects up to 60% of postmenopausal  women. Ospemifene is the first and only nonestrogen compound approved for this  indication. Compared with other approved SERMs, such as tamoxifen, toremifene,  bazedoxifene, and raloxifene, the estrogen-like effects of ospemifene in the  vaginal epithelium are unique. This review first discusses the rationale for  developing ospemifene, including its mechanism of action, and then focuses on  the clinical development of ospemifene for the treatment of dyspareunia  associated with vulvar and vaginal atrophy. Included are discussions of the  effects of ospemifene on the endometrium, serum lipids, coagulation markers,  bone, and breast cancer. In conclusion, ospemifene is a SERM with a unique  estrogen agonist/antagonist tissue profile that was recently approved in the US  for the treatment of dyspareunia associated with vulvar and vaginal atrophy in  postmenopausal women. Ospemifene warrants further clinical investigation for the  treatment and prevention of osteoporosis and breast cancer.', ""OBJECTIVE: To update and expand the previous position statement of The North  American Menopause Society (NAMS) on the management of symptomatic vulvovaginal  atrophy (VVA) in postmenopausal women. METHODS: NAMS searched PubMed for medical literature on VVA published since  their 2007 position statement on the role of local vaginal estrogen for  treatment of vaginal atrophy in postmenopausal women. A panel of acknowledged  experts in the field of genitourinary health reviewed the literature to evaluate  new evidence on local estrogen as well as on other management options available  or in development for symptomatic VVA. The panel's conclusions and  recommendations were reviewed and approved by the NAMS Board of Trustees. RESULTS: Symptomatic VVA can significantly impair the quality of life (QOL) of  postmenopausal women and may be underdiagnosed. In most cases, it can be managed  successfully. A number of over-the-counter and government-approved prescription  therapies available in the United States and Canada demonstrate effectiveness,  depending on the severity of VVA symptoms. These include vaginal lubricants and  moisturizers, vaginal estrogen, hormone therapy, and the selective  estrogen-receptor modulator ospemifene (indicated for dyspareunia). Long-term  studies on the endometrial safety of local estrogen and ospemifene are lacking.  Changes in the vaginal microbiome have various effects on symptoms. CONCLUSIONS: Clinicians can improve the sexual health and QOL of postmenopausal  women by educating women about, diagnosing, and appropriately managing  symptomatic VVA. Choice of therapy depends on the severity of symptoms, the  effectiveness and safety of therapy for the individual patient, and patient  preference. Estrogen therapy is the most effective treatment for moderate to  severe symptoms, although a direct comparison of estrogen and ospemifene is not  available. Nonhormonal therapies available without a prescription provide  sufficient relief for most women with mild symptoms. When low-dose estrogen is  administered locally, a progestogen is not indicated for women without a uterus  and generally is not indicated for women with an intact uterus. However,  endometrial safety has not been studied in clinical trials beyond 1 year. There  are insufficient data to confirm the safety of local estrogen in women with  breast cancer; management of VVA should take the woman's needs and the  recommendation of her oncologist into consideration. Research on the vaginal  microbiome may lead to other therapies in the future."", ""Selective estrogen receptor modulators (SERMs) are structurally different  compounds that interact with intracellular estrogen receptors in target organs  as estrogen receptor agonists or antagonists. These drugs have been intensively  studied over the past decade and have proven to be a highly versatile group for  the treatment of different conditions associated with postmenopausal women's  health, including hormone responsive cancer and osteoporosis. Tamoxifen, a  failed contraceptive is currently used to treat all stages of breast cancer,  chemoprevention in women at high risk for breast cancer and also has beneficial  effects on bone mineral density and serum lipids in postmenopausal women.  Raloxifene, a failed breast cancer drug, is the only SERM approved  internationally for the prevention and treatment of postmenopausal osteoporosis  and vertebral fractures. However, although these SERMs have many benefits, they  also have some potentially serious adverse effects, such as thromboembolic  disorders and, in the case of tamoxifen, uterine cancer. These adverse effects  represent a major concern given that long-term therapy is required to prevent  osteoporosis or prevent and treat breast cancer. The search for the 'ideal'  SERM, which would have estrogenic effects on bone and serum lipids, neutral  effects on the uterus, and antiestrogenic effects on breast tissue, but none of  the adverse effects associated with current therapies, is currently under way.  Ospemifene, lasofoxifene, bazedoxifene and arzoxifene, which are new SERM  molecules with potentially greater efficacy and potency than previous SERMs,  have been investigated for use in the treatment and prevention of osteoporosis.  These drugs have been shown to be comparably effective to conventional hormone  replacement therapy in animal models, with potential indications for an improved  safety profile. Clinical efficacy data from ongoing phase III trials are  available or are awaited for each SERM so that a true understanding of the  therapeutic potential of these compounds can be obtained. In this article, we  describe the discovery and development of the group of medicines called SERMs.  The newer SERMs in late development: ospemifene, lasofoxifene, bazedoxifene, are  arzoxifene are described in detail."", 'OBJECTIVE: To investigate the noninferiority of relugolix compared with  leuprorelin acetate in reducing heavy menstrual bleeding associated with uterine  leiomyomas. METHODS: In a double-blind, double-dummy trial, premenopausal women with uterine  leiomyomas and heavy menstrual bleeding defined as a pictorial blood loss  assessment chart score of at least 120 were randomized in a 1:1 ratio to  relugolix (40 mg, oral, once daily) or leuprorelin acetate (1.88 mg or 3.75 mg,  monthly injection) for 24 weeks. The primary endpoint was the proportion of  patients with a total pictorial blood loss assessment chart score of less than  10 for weeks 6-12. Secondary endpoints included myoma and uterine volumes, and  hemoglobin levels. A sample size of 144 patients per group (n=288) was estimated  to provide at least 90% power to demonstrate noninferiority (prespecified  noninferiority margin -15%; one-sided 0.025 level of significance). RESULTS: From March 2016 to September 2017, 281 patients were randomized  (relugolix, n=139, leuprorelin n=142). Demographic and baseline characteristics  were well balanced; mean pictorial blood loss assessment chart score was 254.3  in the relugolix group and 263.7 in the leuprorelin group. The proportion of  patients with total pictorial blood loss assessment chart score of less than 10  for weeks 6-12 was 82.2% in the relugolix group and 83.1% in the leuprorelin  group, demonstrating noninferiority of relugolix compared with leuprorelin  (relugolix-leuprorelin difference -0.9%; 95% CI: -10.10 to 8.35; prespecified  noninferiority margin -15%; P=.001). Reductions in myoma and uterine volumes and  increases in hemoglobin levels were comparable in the two groups. Relugolix was  associated with an earlier effect on menstrual bleeding than leuprorelin  (pictorial blood loss assessment chart score of less than 10, 64.2% vs 31.7%  [relugolix-leuprorelin difference 32.5%; 95% CI: 20.95-44.13%] for weeks 2-6 and  pictorial blood loss assessment chart score of 0, 52.6% vs 21.8% [30.7%; 95% CI:  19.45-42.00%] for weeks 2-6) and faster recovery of menses after treatment  discontinuation (relugolix median [Q1, Q3], 37 days [32.0, 46.0]; leuprorelin  median, 65 days [54.0, 77.0]). Adverse events and bone mineral density loss were  similar between relugolix and leuprorelin treatment groups. CONCLUSION: In women with uterine leiomyomas, once-daily treatment with  relugolix, an oral gonadotropin-releasing hormone antagonist, demonstrated  noninferiority to monthly leuprorelin for improvement of heavy menstrual  bleeding at 6-12 weeks of treatment, had a more rapid effect on menstrual  bleeding, and was generally well tolerated.

FUNDING SOURCE: Takeda Pharmaceutical Company Limited and an affiliate of  NovaQuest Capital Management LLC.', 'OBJECTIVES: Women-initiated HIV-prevention products are urgently needed. To  address this need, a trial was conducted to assess the safety and  pharmacokinetics of a silicone elastomer matrix vaginal ring containing 25 mg of  the antiretroviral drug dapivirine when used continuously for 28 consecutive  days. METHODS: A double-blind, randomized, placebo-controlled trial was conducted in  16 healthy, HIV-negative women, 18-40 years of age, who were randomized 1:1 to  use either the active or matching placebo ring for 28 days. Participants were  followed during and for 28 days after ring use for safety and pharmacokinetic  evaluations. RESULTS: The dapivirine vaginal ring was safe and well tolerated with no  differences in safety endpoints between the active and placebo ring. The  concentration-time plots of dapivirine in vaginal fluid were indicative of a  sustained release of dapivirine over the 28 days of use. Dapivirine vaginal  fluid concentrations were highest near the ring, followed by the cervix and  introïtus (mean Cmax of 80, 67 and 31 μg/g, respectively). Vaginal fluid  concentrations of dapivirine on the day of ring removal (day 28) at all three  collection sites exceeded by more than 3900-fold the IC99 for dapivirine in a  tissue explant infection model. Plasma dapivirine concentrations were low (< 1  ng/ml) and remained well below those observed at the maximum tolerated dose for  oral treatment (mean Cmax of 2286 \u200ang/ml). CONCLUSION: The dapivirine vaginal ring has a safety and pharmacokinetic profile  that supports its use as a sustained-release topical microbicide for HIV-1  prevention in women.', 'INTRODUCTION: Selective estrogen receptor modulators (SERMs) have been used  off-label in men for more than 50 years. SERMs exert their action on the  estrogen receptor agonistically or antagonistically. A fundamental knowledge of  the complex molecular action and physiology of SERMs is important in  understanding their use and future directions of study in men. AIM: To review the basic science and mechanism of the action of estrogens, the  estrogen receptor, and SERMs, and the existing clinical publications on the use  of SERMs in men for infertility and hypogonadism with their strengths and  weaknesses and to identify the need for future studies. METHODS: After a review of publications on the basic science of estrogen  receptors, a chronologic review of published evidence-based studies on the use  of SERMs in men for infertility and hypogonadism was undertaken. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Clinical publications were assessed for type of study,  inclusion criteria, outcome measurements, and results. Strengths and weaknesses  of the publications were assessed and discussed. RESULTS: Few prospective rigorously controlled trials have been undertaken on  the use of SERMs in men. Most existing trials are largely retrospective  anecdotal studies with inconsistent inclusion and end-point measurements. The  SERMs are complex and at times can produce paradoxical results. Their action  likely depends on the genetics of the individual, his tissue-specific  composition of estrogen receptors, the molecular structure and pharmacodynamics  of the SERMs, and their metabolism. CONCLUSION: Rigorously controlled trials of the use of SERMs in men are needed  to better identify their clinical benefit and long-term safety in infertile and  hypogonadal men. Recent placebo-controlled pharmaceutical industry SERM trials  have demonstrated short-term safety and efficacy in men with secondary  hypogonadism and eventually might provide an alternative to exogenous  testosterone replacement therapy in men with secondary hypogonadism.

Sex Med Rev 2017;5:365-386.', 'OBJECTIVE: To evaluate the efficacy and safety of intermittent, luteal  phase-only administration of paroxetine (10 mg and 20 mg) in the treatment of  premenstrual dysphoric disorder (PMDD). METHOD: In this multicenter trial, female outpatients (aged 18-45 years) from 4  Canadian health centers meeting DSM-IV criteria for PMDD were asked to perform  daily ratings of their premenstrual symptoms for 2 consecutive menstrual cycles.  Those displaying the symptoms of irritability and/or depressed mood in the  luteal phases but not in the follicular phases of their menstrual cycles were  randomly assigned to intermittent, luteal phase-only treatment with paroxetine  10 mg or 20 mg or placebo for 4 additional cycles. The primary efficacy endpoint  was the percent change from baseline at study endpoint on the visual analog  scale irritability score. Treatment differences were tested using analysis of  covariance ad hoc. Estimated treatment mean differences and their associated 95%  confidence intervals were also calculated. Data were collected from May 1999 to  November 2002. RESULTS: Ninety-nine patients were included in the intention-to-treat  population. When compared with placebo, patients treated with paroxetine 20 mg  attained a significant reduction in irritability (difference in median percent  change: -23.9, 95% CI = -51.3 to -6.2, p = .014; difference in mean absolute  change: -18.6, 95% CI = -32.5 to -4.6, p = .007). A statistically significant  difference was not observed when the patients treated with the lower dose of  paroxetine (10 mg) were compared with placebo. Treatment was well tolerated with  no unexpected side effects. CONCLUSIONS: Intermittent administration of paroxetine 20 mg significantly  reduced irritability symptoms in patients with PMDD. These results are  consistent with previous studies suggesting that PMDD may be treated effectively  by luteal phase-only administration of a selective serotonin reuptake inhibitor.

38,Which is the role of mediator in genome organization?,"['Alterations in the regulation of gene expression are frequently associated with  developmental diseases or cancer. Transcription activation is a key phenomenon  in the regulation of gene expression. In all eukaryotes, mediator of RNA  polymerase II transcription (Mediator), a large complex with modular  organization, is generally required for transcription by RNA polymerase II, and  it regulates various steps of this process. The main function of Mediator is to  transduce signals from the transcription activators bound to enhancer regions to  the transcription machinery, which is assembled at promoters as the  preinitiation complex (PIC) to control transcription initiation. Recent  functional studies of Mediator with the use of structural biology approaches and  functional genomics have revealed new insights into Mediator activity and its  regulation during transcription initiation, including how Mediator is recruited  to transcription regulatory regions and how it interacts and cooperates with PIC  components to assist in PIC assembly. Novel roles of Mediator in the control of  gene expression have also been revealed by showing its connection to the nuclear  pore and linking Mediator to the regulation of gene positioning in the nuclear  space. Clear links between Mediator subunits and disease have also encouraged  studies to explore targeting of this complex as a potential therapeutic approach  in cancer and fungal infections.', ""Mediator is a large multiprotein complex conserved in all eukaryotes, which has  a crucial coregulator function in transcription by RNA polymerase II (Pol II).  However, the molecular mechanisms of its action in vivo remain to be understood.  Med17 is an essential and central component of the Mediator head module. In this  work, we utilised our large collection of conditional temperature-sensitive  med17 mutants to investigate Mediator's role in coordinating preinitiation  complex (PIC) formation in vivo at the genome level after a transfer to a  non-permissive temperature for 45 minutes. The effect of a yeast mutation  proposed to be equivalent to the human Med17-L371P responsible for infantile  cerebral atrophy was also analyzed. The ChIP-seq results demonstrate that med17  mutations differentially affected the global presence of several PIC components  including Mediator, TBP, TFIIH modules and Pol II. Our data show that Mediator  stabilizes TFIIK kinase and TFIIH core modules independently, suggesting that  the recruitment or the stability of TFIIH modules is regulated independently on  yeast genome. We demonstrate that Mediator selectively contributes to TBP  recruitment or stabilization to chromatin. This study provides an extensive  genome-wide view of Mediator's role in PIC formation, suggesting that Mediator  coordinates multiple steps of a PIC assembly pathway."", 'Homologous recombination is crucial for genome stability and for genetic  exchange. Although our knowledge of the principle steps in recombination and its  machinery is well advanced, homology search, the critical step of exploring the  genome for homologous sequences to enable recombination, has remained mostly  enigmatic. However, recent methodological advances have provided considerable  new insights into this fundamental step in recombination that can be integrated  into a mechanistic model. These advances emphasize the importance of genomic  proximity and nuclear organization for homology search and the critical role of  homology search mediators in this process. They also aid our understanding of  how homology search might lead to unwanted and potentially disease-promoting  recombination events.', 'Mediator is a highly conserved transcriptional coactivator organized into four  modules, namely Tail, Middle, Head, and Kinase (CKM). Previous work suggests  regulatory roles for Tail and CKM, but an integrated model for these activities  is lacking. Here, we analyzed the genome-wide distribution of Mediator subunits  in wild-type and mutant yeast cells in which RNA polymerase II promoter escape  is blocked, allowing detection of transient Mediator forms. We found that  although all modules are recruited to upstream activated regions (UAS), assembly  of Mediator within the pre-initiation complex is accompanied by the release of  CKM. Interestingly, our data show that CKM regulates Mediator-UAS interaction  rather than Mediator-promoter association. In addition, although Tail is  required for Mediator recruitment to UAS, Tailless Mediator nevertheless  interacts with core promoters. Collectively, our data suggest that the essential  function of Mediator is mediated by Head and Middle at core promoters, while  Tail and CKM play regulatory roles.', ""Mediator is a multi-unit molecular complex that plays a key role in transferring  signals from transcriptional regulators to RNA polymerase II in eukaryotes. We  have combined biochemical purification of the Saccharomyces cerevisiae Mediator  from chromatin with chromatin immunoprecipitation in order to reveal Mediator  occupancy on DNA genome-wide, and to identify proteins interacting specifically  with Mediator on the chromatin template. Tandem mass spectrometry of proteins in  immunoprecipitates of mediator complexes revealed specific interactions between  Mediator and the RSC, Arp2/Arp3, CPF, CF 1A and Lsm complexes in chromatin.  These factors are primarily involved in chromatin remodeling, actin assembly,  mRNA 3'-end processing, gene looping and mRNA decay, but they have also been  shown to enter the nucleus and participate in Pol II transcription. Moreover, we  have found that Mediator, in addition to binding Pol II promoters, occupies  chromosomal interacting domain (CID) boundaries and that Mediator in chromatin  associates with proteins that have been shown to interact with CID boundaries,  such as Sth1, Ssu72 and histone H4. This suggests that Mediator plays a  significant role in higher-order genome organization."", 'The role of the zinc finger protein CTCF in organizing the genome within the  nucleus is now well established. Widely separated sites on DNA, occupied by both  CTCF and the cohesin complex, make physical contacts that create large loop  domains. Additional contacts between loci within those domains, often also  mediated by CTCF, tend to be favored over contacts between loci in different  domains. A large number of studies during the past 2 years have addressed the  questions: How are these loops generated? What are the effects of disrupting  them? Are there rules governing large-scale genome organization? It now appears  that the strongest and evolutionarily most conserved of these CTCF interactions  have specific rules for the orientation of the paired CTCF sites, implying the  existence of a nonequilibrium mechanism of generation. Recent experiments that  invert, delete, or inactivate one of a mating CTCF pair result in major changes  in patterns of organization and gene expression in the surrounding regions. What  remain to be determined are the detailed molecular mechanisms for  re-establishing loop domains and maintaining them after replication and mitosis.  As recently published data show, some mechanisms may involve interactions with  noncoding RNAs as well as protein cofactors. Many CTCF sites are also involved  in other functions such as modulation of RNA splicing and specific regulation of  gene expression, and the relationship between these activities and loop  formation is another unanswered question that should keep investigators occupied  for some time.', 'Assembly of compact mitotic chromosomes and resolution of sister chromatids are  two essential processes for the correct segregation of the genome during  mitosis. Condensin, a five-subunit protein complex, is thought to be required  for chromosome condensation. However, recent genetic analysis suggests that  condensin is only essential to resolve sister chromatids. To study further the  function of condensin we have depleted DmSMC4, a subunit of the complex, from  Drosophila S2 cells by dsRNA-mediated interference. Cells lacking DmSMC4  assemble short mitotic chromosomes with unresolved sister chromatids where  Barren, a non-SMC subunit of the complex is unable to localise. Topoisomerase  II, however, binds mitotic chromatin after depletion of DmSMC4 but it is no  longer confined to a central axial structure and becomes diffusely distributed  all over the chromatin. Furthermore, cell extracts from DmSMC4 dsRNA-treated  cells show significantly reduced topoisomerase II-dependent DNA decatenation  activity in vitro. Nevertheless, DmSMC4-depleted chromosomes have centromeres  and kinetochores that are able to segregate, although sister chromatid arms form  extensive chromatin bridges during anaphase. These chromatin bridges do not  result from inappropriate maintenance of sister chromatid cohesion by DRAD21, a  subunit of the cohesin complex. Moreover, depletion of DmSMC4 prevents premature  sister chromatid separation, caused by removal of DRAD21, allowing cells to exit  mitosis with chromatin bridges. Our results suggest that condensin is required  so that an axial chromatid structure can be organised where topoisomerase II can  effectively promote sister chromatid resolution.', 'Chromosome conformation capture approaches have shown that interphase chromatin  is partitioned into spatially segregated Mb-sized compartments and sub-Mb-sized  topological domains. This compartmentalization is thought to facilitate the  matching of genes and regulatory elements, but its precise function and  mechanistic basis remain unknown. Cohesin controls chromosome topology to enable  DNA repair and chromosome segregation in cycling cells. In addition, cohesin  associates with active enhancers and promoters and with CTCF to form long-range  interactions important for gene regulation. Although these findings suggest an  important role for cohesin in genome organization, this role has not been  assessed on a global scale. Unexpectedly, we find that architectural  compartments are maintained in noncycling mouse thymocytes after genetic  depletion of cohesin in vivo. Cohesin was, however, required for specific  long-range interactions within compartments where cohesin-regulated genes  reside. Cohesin depletion diminished interactions between cohesin-bound sites,  whereas alternative interactions between chromatin features associated with  transcriptional activation and repression became more prominent, with  corresponding changes in gene expression. Our findings indicate that  cohesin-mediated long-range interactions facilitate discrete gene expression  states within preexisting chromosomal compartments.', 'Cohesin-mediated sister chromatid cohesion is essential for chromosome  segregation and post-replicative DNA repair. In addition, evidence from model  organisms and from human genetics suggests that cohesin is involved in the  control of gene expression. This non-canonical role has recently been  rationalized by the findings that mammalian cohesin complexes are recruited to a  subset of DNase I hypersensitive sites and to conserved noncoding sequences by  the DNA-binding protein CTCF. CTCF functions at insulators (which control  interactions between enhancers and promoters) and at boundary elements (which  demarcate regions of distinct chromatin structure), and cohesin contributes to  its enhancer-blocking activity. The underlying mechanisms remain unknown, and  the full spectrum of cohesin functions remains to be determined. Here we show  that cohesin forms the topological and mechanistic basis for cell-type-specific  long-range chromosomal interactions in cis at the developmentally regulated  cytokine locus IFNG. Hence, the ability of cohesin to constrain chromosome  topology is used not only for the purpose of sister chromatid cohesion, but also  to dynamically define the spatial conformation of specific loci. This new aspect  of cohesin function is probably important for normal development and disease.', 'When placed between an enhancer and promoter, certain DNA sequence elements  inhibit enhancer-stimulated gene expression. The best characterized of these  enhancer-blocking insulators, gypsy in Drosophila and the CTCF-binding element  in vertebrates and flies, stabilize contacts between distant genomic regulatory  sites leading to the formation of loop domains. Current results show that CTCF  mediates long-range contacts in the mouse beta-globin locus and at the  Igf2/H19-imprinted locus. Recently described active chromatin hubs and  transcription factories also involve long-range interactions; it is likely that  CTCF interferes with their formation when acting as an insulator. The properties  of CTCF, and its newly described genomic distribution, suggest that it may play  an important role in large-scale nuclear architecture, perhaps mediated by the  co-factors with which it interacts in vivo.']","Mediator binds to boundaries of chromosomal interaction domains and to proteins involved in DNA looping, RNA metabolism, chromatin remodeling, and actin assembly."
39,What is the mechanisms of action of Evinacumab?,"['BACKGROUND: Hypertriglyceridemia is associated with increased cardiovascular  risk and may be caused by impaired lipoprotein clearance. Angiopoietin-like  protein 3 (ANGPTL3) inhibits lipoprotein lipase activity, increasing  triglycerides and other lipids. Evinacumab, an ANGPTL3 inhibitor, reduced  triglycerides in healthy human volunteers and in homozygous familial  hypercholesterolemic individuals. Results from 2 Phase 1 studies in  hypertriglyceridemic subjects are reported here. METHODS: Subjects with triglycerides >150 but ≤450 mg/dL and low-density  lipoprotein cholesterol ≥100 mg/dL (n=83 for single ascending dose study [SAD];  n=56 for multiple ascending dose study [MAD]) were randomized 3:1 to  evinacumab:placebo. SAD subjects received evinacumab subcutaneously at  75/150/250 mg, or intravenously at 5/10/20 mg/kg, monitored up to day 126. MAD  subjects received evinacumab subcutaneously at 150/300/450 mg once weekly,  300/450 mg every 2 weeks, or intravenously at 20 mg/kg once every 4 weeks up to  day 56 with 6 months of follow-up. The primary outcomes were incidence and  severity of treatment-emergent adverse events. Efficacy analyses included  changes in triglycerides and other lipids over time. RESULTS: In the SAD, 32 (51.6%) versus 9 (42.9%) subjects on evinacumab versus  placebo reported treatment-emergent adverse events. In the MAD, 21 (67.7%)  versus 9 (75.0%) subjects on subcutaneously evinacumab versus placebo and 6  (85.7%) versus 1 (50.0%) on intravenously evinacumab versus placebo reported  treatment-emergent adverse events. No serious treatment-emergent adverse events  or events leading to death or treatment discontinuation were reported.  Elevations in alanine aminotransferase (7 [11.3%] SAD), aspartate  aminotransferase (4 [6.5%] SAD), and creatinine phosphokinase (2 [3.2%) SAD, 1  [14.3%] MAD) were observed with evinacumab (none in the placebo groups), which  were single elevations and were not dose-related. Dose-dependent reductions in  triglycerides were observed in both studies, with maximum reduction of 76.9% at  day 3 with 10 mg/kg intravenously (P<0.0001) in the SAD and of 83.1% at day 2  with 20 mg/kg intravenously once every 4 weeks (P=0.0003) in the MAD.  Significant reductions in other lipids were observed with most evinacumab doses  versus placebo. CONCLUSION: Evinacumab was well-tolerated in 2 Phase 1 studies. Lipid changes in  hypertriglyceridemic subjects were similar to those observed with ANGPTL3  loss-of-function mutations. Because the latter is associated with reduced  cardiovascular risk, ANGPTL3 inhibition may improve clinical outcomes. CLINICAL TRIAL REGISTRATION: https://www.clinicaltrials.gov. Unique identifiers:  NCT01749878 and NCT02107872.', 'Lipid-lowering therapy is one major cornerstone of medical treatment of  cardiovascular disease in order to modulate atherosclerosis. Statins, ezetimibe  and novel PCSK9-inhibitors are already recommended in current guidelines and  were shown to improve lipid profiles and have positive effects on the rate of  ischemic events and cardiovascular mortality. Recent studies suggest that the  concept of ""The lower the better"" might be valid at least regarding low density  lipoproteins. In addition, lowering lipoprotein (a) still displays a major  challenge in lipid therapy. Furthermore, also lowering triglycerides seems to  improve cardiovascular outcome. Regarding triglycerides, icosapent ethyl, a  polyunsaturated fatty acid recently attracted attention showing cardiovascular  risk reduction due to triglyceride lowering. Therefore, new therapeutic  strategies and drug classes are eagerly awaited. Targeting LDL, bempedoic acid  and the siRNA inclisiran provide promising results. Moreover, regarding TG a  monoclonal antibody called evinacumab and an antisense-oligonucleotide against  ANGPTL3 showed effective TG-lowering. At least, using antisense-oligonucleotides  against ApoC-III and Lp(a) resulted in promising outcomes. In this review,  current and future options for lipid management are presented depending on  different drug classes.', 'OBJECTIVE: Homozygous familial hypercholesterolemia is a rare disease usually  caused by LDLR (low-density lipoprotein receptor) mutations. Homozygous familial  hypercholesterolemia is characterized by markedly elevated LDL-C (low-density  lipoprotein cholesterol) levels and an extremely high risk of premature  atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease. A phase 2, proof-of-concept study  (NCT02265952) demonstrated that evinacumab, a fully human monoclonal antibody to  ANGPTL3 (angiopoietin-like 3 protein), reduced LDL-C levels in 9 patients with  genotypically confirmed homozygous familial hypercholesterolemia and was well  tolerated. The aim of this study was to analyze the effects of evinacumab on  LDLR activity in lymphocytes purified from patients in the proof-of-concept  study. Approach and Results: LDLR activity was assessed in patient lymphocytes  before and after treatment with evinacumab and versus lymphocytes carrying  wild-type LDLR, and also in an LDLR-defective Chinese hamster ovary cell line  (CHO-ldlA7) transfected with plasmids encoding the LDLR variants. Overall mean  peak reduction in LDL-C with evinacumab was -58±18%, occurring between Week 4  and Week 12. Mutations identified in the 9 patients were shown to be pathogenic,  with loss of LDLR activity versus wild type. Two of the LDLR variants,  p.(Cys681*) and p.(Ala627Profs*38), were class 2 type mutations that are  retained in the endoplasmic reticulum. Six variants were class 3 type mutations  with impaired LDL-C binding activity: p.(Trp87Gly), occurring in 2 patients,  p.(Gln254Pro), p.(Ser177Leu), p.(Gly335Val), and p.(Ser306Leu). Evinacumab had  no effect on LDLR activity. CONCLUSIONS: These results suggest that evinacumab is effective for lowering  LDL-C in patients with homozygous familial hypercholesterolemia, and the  inhibition of ANGPTL3 in humans lowers LDL-C in a mechanism independent of the  LDLR.', ""Angiopoietin-like 3 protein (ANGPTL3) is an inhibitor of both lipoprotein lipase  and endothelial lipase in humans. Population studies indicate a relationship  between loss of function mutations in ANGPTL3 and favorable reductions in  triglycerides and non- high-density lipoprotein cholesterol. In addition, loss  of function mutations is associated with a reduced risk of coronary artery  disease. Whereas ANGPTL3's role in human lipid metabolism has yet to be fully  clarified, it is unlikely that ANGPTL3 impacts cholesterol uptake via the  low-density lipoprotein-receptor, unlike the proprotein convertase  subtilisin/kexin9 inhibitors. In contrast to other forms of lipid-lowering  therapy, ANGPTL3 inhibition may improve insulin sensitivity. The promise of this  new therapy, particularly its independence from the low-density  lipoprotein-receptor, has prompted the creation of a monoclonal antibody  inhibitor; evinacumab. Evinacumab has shown favorable lipid-lowering action in  both human and mouse models. Efficacy trials are currently ongoing and will be  completed in the near future. In addition, ANGPTL3 inhibition via an antisense  oligonucleotide was performed in healthy human subjects, which resulted in a  dose-dependent reduction in circulating ANGPTL3 levels and an antiatherogenic  lipid profile. When tested in mouse models, administration of the antisense  oligonucleotide caused a reduction in progression of atherosclerosis. Further  investigation is required to evaluate the efficacy, safety and net benefit of  clinical ANGPTL3 inhibition before it can be accepted into clinical practice."", 'Although elevated serum low-density lipoprotein-cholesterol (LDL-C) is without  any doubts accepted as an important risk factor for cardiovascular disease  (CVD), the role of elevated triglycerides (TGs)-rich lipoproteins as an  independent risk factor has until recently been quite controversial. Recent data  strongly suggest that elevated TG-rich lipoproteins are an independent risk  factor for CVD and that therapeutic targeting of them could possibly provide  further benefit in reducing CVD morbidity, events and mortality, apart from  LDL-C lowering. Today elevated TGs are treated with lifestyle interventions, and  with fibrates which could be combined with omega-3 fatty acids. There are also  some new drugs. Volanesorsen, is an antisense oligonucleotid that inhibits the  production of the Apo C-III which is crucial in regulating TGs metabolism  because it inhibits lipoprotein lipase (LPL) and hepatic lipase activity but  also hepatic uptake of TGs-rich particles. Evinacumab is a monoclonal antibody  against angiopoietin-like protein 3 (ANGPTL3) and it seems that it can  substantially lower elevated TGs levels because ANGPTL3 also regulates TGs  metabolism. Pemafibrate is a selective peroxisome proliferator-activated  receptor alpha modulator which also decreases TGs, and improves other lipid  parameters. It seems that it also has some other possible antiatherogenic  effects. Alipogene tiparvovec is a nonreplicating adeno-associated viral vector  that delivers copies of the LPL gene to muscle tissue which accelerates the  clearance of TG-rich lipoproteins thus decreasing extremely high TGs levels.  Pradigastat is a novel diacylglycerol acyltransferase 1 inhibitor which  substantially reduces extremely high TGs levels and appears to be promising in  treatment of the rare familial chylomicronemia syndrome.', 'OBJECTIVE: Engulfment and cell motility 1 (Elmo1) has been reported to cooperate  with dedicator of cytokinesis 1 (Dock180) and to be linked to the invasive  phenotype of cancer cells through activating small G-protein Rac. We aimed to  study the role of Elmo1 in the malignant migration of ovarian cancer. METHODS: Engulfment and cell motility 1 expression was evaluated in specimens  from 93 patients with serous ovarian cancer (SOC) by immunohistochemical  staining. Next, Elmo1-RNAi cells were established by validated small  interference RNAs. Cell proliferation and cell motility were observed and  compared with Dock180-RNAi cells. To confirm their synergetic contribution to  forming focal adhesion and activating Rac1, Rac1-GTP level was measured by GST  pull-down assay and immunofluorescence was used to observe focal adhesion  formation both in Elmo1-RNAi and Dock180-RNAi cells. RESULTS: Engulfment and cell motility 1 was mainly overexpressed in high-grade  SOC tissues. Western blot analysis demonstrated that both Elmo1 and Dock180  expressions were hampered in Elmo1-RNAi cells. Compared with the negative  control, decreased colony formation and cell invasion were observed in  Elmo1-RNAi cells and Dock180-RNAi cells. Consistently, both exhibited reduced  Rac1-GTP level and inhibited focal adhesion formation. CONCLUSIONS: Engulfment and cell motility 1 presents with synergetic action in  helping Dock180 to activate Rac1 and promote cell motility, and thus promote  untoward expansion and aggressiveness of SOC.', 'Artepillin C is the main compound present in propolis from Baccharis  dracunculifolia, whose antitumor activity has been the focus of many studies.  Herein, we shall investigate the Artepillin C mechanisms of action against cells  derived from the oropharyngeal carcinoma (HEp-2). Cytotoxicity tests revealed  that the concentrations of Artepillin C required to reduce cell viability by 50%  (CC50) are dependent on the incubation time, decreasing from 40.7\xa0×\xa010-5\xa0mol/L  to 15.7\xa0×\xa010-5\xa0mol/L and 9.05\xa0×\xa010-5\xa0mol/L considering 12, 24 and 48\xa0h,  respectively. Hydrophobic interactions on neutral species of Artepillin C induce  aggregation over the HEp-2 plasma membrane, given the acid conditions of the  cellular culture. Indeed, Langmuir monolayers mimicking cellular membranes of  tumor cells revealed Artepillin C affinity to interact with  1,2-dipalmitoyl-sn-glycero-3-phosphocholine (DPPC) containing 20\xa0mol% of  1,2-dipalmitoyl-sn-glychero-3-phosphoserine (DPPS), leading aggregation on giant  unilamellar vesicles (GUVs) at pH\xa03.2. Moreover, leakage experiments on GUVs  have shown that the presence of DPPS enhances the efflux of the fluorescent  probe signaling the membrane permeabilization, which is the origin of the  necrotic pathway triggered in HEp-2 cells, as observed by flow cytometry assays.', ""The pathogenic mechanisms underlying cancer development are complex and  heterogeneous, involving multiple cellular signaling transduction pathways that  usually function redundantly. In addition, crosstalk between these pathways  generates a complicated and robust signaling network that is regulated by  compensatory mechanisms. Given the complexity of cancer pathogenesis and  progression, many of the currently used antitumor agents, which typically target  a single intracellular pathway, might not always be effective on complex tumor  systems. Moreover, long-term use of these agents often generates drug resistance  and toxicity against normal cells. Therefore, the development of novel  anticancer chemotherapies is urgently needed.Scutellaria barbataD Don (SB) is a  medicinal herb that has long been used in China to treat various types of  cancer. We previously reported that the ethanol extract of SB (EESB) is able to  induce colon cancer cell apoptosis, inhibit cell proliferation and tumor  angiogenesis via modulation of several pathways, including Hedgehog, Akt, and  p53. To further elucidate the precise mechanisms of SB's antitumor activity,  using a colorectal cancer (CRC) mouse xenograft model in the present study, we  evaluated the therapeutic efficacy and molecular mechanisms of EESB against  tumor growth. We found that EESB reduced tumor volume and tumor weight but had  no effect on body weight gain in CRC mice, demonstrating that EESB could inhibit  colon cancer growth in vivo without apparent adverse effect. In addition, EESB  treatment could significantly suppress the activation of several CRC-related  pathways, including STAT3, Erk, and p38 signalings in tumor tissues, and alter  the expression of multiple critical target genes such as Bcl-2, Bax, Cyclin D1,  CDK4, and p21. These molecular effects lead to the induction of cancer cell  apoptosis and inhibition of cell proliferation. Our findings demonstrate that SB  possesses a broad range of antitumor activities because of its ability to affect  multiple intracellular targets."", ""Modification of proteins with Met1-linked 'linear' ubiquitin chains has emerged  as a key regulatory signal to control inflammatory signalling via the master  regulator, the transcription factor nuclear factor κB (NF-κB). While the  assembly machinery, the linear ubiquitin chain assembly complex (LUBAC), and  receptors for this ubiquitin chain type have been known for years, it was less  clear which deubiquitinating enzymes (DUBs) hydrolyse Met1 linkages  specifically. In 2013, two labs reported the previously unannotated protein  FAM105B/OTULIN to be this missing Met1 linkage-specific DUB. Structural studies  have revealed how OTULIN achieves its remarkable specificity, employing a  mechanism of ubiquitin-assisted catalysis in which a glutamate residue on the  substrate complements the active site of the enzyme. The specificity of OTULIN  enables it to regulate global levels of Met1-linked polyubiquitin in cells. This  ability led to investigations of NF-κB activation from new angles, and also  revealed involvement of Met1-polyubiquitin in Wnt signalling. Interestingly,  OTULIN directly interacts with LUBAC, and this interaction is dynamic and can be  regulated by OTULIN phosphorylation. This provides a new paradigm for how  individual linkage types can be regulated by dedicated enzyme complexes  mediating assembly and removal. Here we review what has been learned about  OTULIN's mechanism, regulation and function, discuss the open questions in the  field, and discuss how DUBs regulate the NF-κB response."", 'Mannose 6-phosphate receptors carry newly synthesized lysosomal hydrolases from  the trans-Golgi network to endosomes, then return to the trans-Golgi network for  another round of enzyme delivery. Wortmannin, an inhibitor of  phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase, interferes with the delivery of newly synthesized  lysosomal enzymes to lysosomes. We used two independent assays of mannose  6-phosphate receptor trafficking to determine the precise step that is blocked  by wortmannin. Using an assay that monitors resialylation of desialylated cell  surface 300-kDa mannose 6-phosphate receptors, we found that receptor  endocytosis and transport to the trans-Golgi network were not inhibited by 2  microM wortmannin. In addition, this concentration of drug had no effect on the  transport of the mannose 6-phosphate receptor from late endosomes to the  trans-Golgi network using a system that reconstitutes this transport process in  cell extracts. Under the same conditions, wortmannin significantly inhibited the  generation of mature cathepsin D. In addition, the structurally unrelated  phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase inhibitor, LY294002, was also without effect when  added to in vitro endosome-trans-Golgi network transport reactions. These  experiments demonstrate that the interruption in lysosomal enzyme targeting is  most likely due to a wortmannin-sensitive process required for the export of  these receptors from the trans-Golgi network, consistent with the established  role of phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase in the equivalent transport process in  Saccharomyces cerevisiae.']",Evinacumab is angiopoietin-like protein 3 (ANGPTL3) monoclonal antibody that was shown to substantially reduce low-density lipoprotein cholesterol concentration.
40,Is long QT syndrome a cause for sudden cardiac death in athletes?,"['The congenital long QT syndrome (LQTS) is caused by cardiac ion channel  mutations, which predispose young individuals to sudden cardiac death often  related to exercise. The issue of LQTS and sports participation has received  significant publicity due to reports of sudden death in young competitive  athletes. This article reviews the pathophysiology, clinical characteristics,  and management of LQTS in the physically active and athletic population.', 'Cardiovascular diseases account for 40% of all deaths in the Western countries,  and nearly two thirds of them occur suddenly. Young people (<35 years) are not  spared from sudden death (SD) with a rate of 1/100,000 per year. Effort is a  trigger with a threefold risk in athletes vs. nonathletes, and sports  disqualification is by itself life-saving in people with underlying concealed  cardiovascular diseases. Several culprits of cardiac SD may be identified at  postmortem and atherosclerotic coronary artery disease is the leading cause (25%  of SD cases in the young), mostly consisting of a single obstructive plaque with  fibrocellular intimal proliferation. However, the spectrum of cardiovascular  substrates is wide and include also congenital diseases of the coronary arteries  (mainly anomalous origin), myocardium (arrhythmogenic and hypertrophic  cardiomyopathies, myocarditis), valves (aortic stenosis and mitral valve  prolapse), and conduction system (ventricular preexcitation, accelerated  atrioventricular conduction and block). In up to 20% of cases, the heart is  grossly and histologically normal at autopsy (unexplained SD or ""mors sine  materia""), and inherited ion channel diseases have been implicated (long and  short QT syndromes, Brugada syndrome, catecholaminergic polymorphic ventricular  tachycardia). Targets to treat and prevent SD in the young consist of the  following: (a) avoid triggers like effort or emotion, (b) inhibit the onset of  arrhythmias with drugs or ablation, (c) switch off arrhythmias with  defibrillator, and (d) hinder the recurrence of the disease with genetic  counseling and/or therapy. In vivo detection of cardiomyopathies is nowadays  feasible by electrocardiogram and/or echocardiography, which resulted in a sharp  decline of SD in the athletes in Italy, thanks to obligatory preparticipation  screening for sport activity. Genetic screening could play a pivotal role in  early detection of asymptomatic mutation carriers of cardiovascular diseases at  risk of SD.', 'Knowledge of sudden cardiac death in young athletes is imperative for all  physicians and allied health professionals. The complete differential diagnosis  of a young patient with sudden cardiac arrest will result in proper work-up and  treatment. In this article, we review several etiologies of sudden cardiac  death, including hypertrophic cardiomyopathy, arrhythmogenic right ventricular  cardiomyopathy, Wolff-Parkinson-White syndrome, long QT syndrome, Brugada  syndrome, and commotio cordis. Clinical findings, work-up, treatment, long-term  management, and athlete preparticipation screening guidelines are discussed.', 'A group of relatively uncommon but important genetic cardiovascular diseases  (GCVDs) are associated with increased risk for sudden cardiac death during  exercise, including hypertrophic cardiomyopathy, long-QT syndrome, Marfan  syndrome, and arrhythmogenic right ventricular cardiomyopathy. These conditions,  characterized by diverse phenotypic expression and genetic substrates, account  for a substantial proportion of unexpected and usually arrhythmia-based fatal  events during adolescence and young adulthood. Guidelines are in place governing  eligibility and disqualification criteria for competitive athletes with these  GCVDs (eg, Bethesda Conference No. 26 and its update as Bethesda Conference No.  36 in 2005). However, similar systematic recommendations for the much larger  population of patients with GCVD who are not trained athletes, but nevertheless  wish to participate in any of a variety of recreational physical activities and  sports, have not been available. The practicing clinician is frequently  confronted with the dilemma of designing noncompetitive exercise programs for  athletes with GCVD after disqualification from competition, as well as for those  patients with such conditions who do not aspire to organized sports. Indeed,  many asymptomatic (or mildly symptomatic) patients with GCVD desire a physically  active lifestyle with participation in recreational and leisure-time activities  to take advantage of the many documented benefits of exercise. However, to date,  no reference document has been available for ascertaining which types of  physical activity could be regarded as either prudent or inadvisable in these  subgroups of patients. Therefore, given this clear and present need, this  American Heart Association consensus document was constituted, based largely on  the experience and insights of the expert panel, to offer recommendations  governing recreational exercise for patients with known GCVDs.', 'Sudden cardiac death (SCD) in young athletes is generally caused by inherited  cardiac disorders. While these events are relatively few compared to other  cardiac deaths, they are tragic in that death occurs in a young, otherwise  healthy person. The genetic abnormalities most associated with SCD are  hypertrophic cardiomyopathy, arrhythmogenic right ventricular cardiomyopathy,  long QT syndrome, Brugada syndrome, and catecholaminergic polymorphic  ventricular tachycardia. As a result of growing awareness that these deaths can  be prevented, guidelines have been issued in both Europe and the United States  to help screen and determine qualification for young persons who want to  participate in competitive athletics. There remains debate on the how extensive  screening should be, in particular over the use of the 12-lead electrocardiogram  (ECG), with European guidelines mandating ECG and United States guidelines not  recommending routine use of the ECG.', 'In approximately 10-20% of all sudden deaths, no structural cardiac  abnormalities can be identified. Important potential causes of sudden cardiac  deaths in the absence of heart disease are primary electrical diseases such as  Brugada syndrome, long QT syndrome (LQTS), short QT syndrome (SQTS), and  catecholaminergic polymorphic ventricular tachyarrhythmias (CPVT). The resting  ECG and the ECG under exercise are pivotal for the diagnosis of ion channel  diseases. Molecular genetic screening can reveal underlying mutations in a  variable degree among the cardiac ion channel diseases in up to 70% (LQTS) and  may identify individuals with incomplete penetration of the disease. In patients  with primary electrical diseases, specific clinical triggers for arrhythmic  events such as syncope or sudden cardiac death have been identified including  exercise, strenuous activity, auditory stimuli, or increased vagal tone. Young,  otherwise healthy individuals are likely to be involved in sports activity.  Therefore, special attention has to be given to advise these patients.  Competitive sports and vigorous exercise are contraindications in almost all  patients. Even recreational exercise may have to be avoided in phenotypically  overt patients or silent gene carriers depending on the underlying disease.', 'Sudden cardiac deaths in athletes are usually due to underlying cardiovascular  disease. The final pathway is usually ventricular fibrillation following  hypertrophic cardiomyopathy and coronary artery anomalies in young persons below  the age of 30 years. Sudden cardiac death in young is rare but remains as a  source of concern. A postmortem study was conducted to ascertain the cardiac  causes of sudden death in persons below the age group 30 years following  exercise in games or otherwise. Out of 15 cases in autopsy finding, hypertrophic  cardiomyopathy (n=7) was the commonest cause followed by coronary artery  anomalies (n=4). Sudden unexpected death is a source of concern and careful  screening of history and physical examination for potential athletes should  identify majority of people at risk.', ""Athletic activity is associated with an increased risk of sudden death for  individuals with some congenital or acquired heart disorders. This review  considers in particular the causes of death affecting athletes below 35 years of  age. In this age group the largest proportion of deaths are caused by diseases  with autosomal dominant inheritance such as hypertrophic cardiomyopathy,  arrhythmogenic right ventricular cardiomyopathy, long QT-syndrome, and Marfan's  syndrome. A policy of early cascade-screening of all first-degree relatives of  patients with these disorders will therefore detect a substantial number of  individuals at risk. A strictly regulated system with preparticipation screening  of all athletes following a protocol pioneered in Italy, including school-age  children, can also detect cases caused by sporadic new mutations and has been  shown to reduce excess mortality among athletes substantially. Recommendations  for screening procedure are reviewed. It is concluded that ECG screening ought  to be part of preparticipation screening, but using criteria that do not cause  too many false positives among athletes. One such suggested protocol will show  positive in approximately 5% of screened individuals, among whom many will be  screened for these diseases. On this point further research is needed to define  what kind of false-positive and false-negative rate these new criteria result  in. A less formal system based on cascade-screening of relatives, education of  coaches about suspicious symptoms, and preparticipation questionnaires used by  athletic clubs, has been associated over time with a sizeable reduction in  sudden cardiac deaths among Swedish athletes, and thus appears to be worth  implementing even for junior athletes not recommended for formal  preparticipation screening. It is strongly argued that in families with  autosomal dominant disorders the first screening of children should be carried  out no later than 6 to 7 years of age."", 'Previous events evidence that sudden cardiac death (SCD) in athletes is still a  reality and it keeps challenging cardiologists. Considering the importance of  SCD in athletes and the requisite for an update of this matter, we endeavored to  describe SCD in athletes. The Medline (via PubMed) and SciELO databases were  searched using the subject keywords ""sudden death, athletes and mortality"". The  incidence of SCD is expected at one case for each 200,000 young athletes per  year. Overall it is resulted of complex dealings of factors such as  arrhythmogenic substrate, regulator and triggers factors. In great part of  deaths caused by heart disease in athletes younger than 35 years old  investigations evidence cardiac congenital abnormalities. Athletes above 35  years old possibly die due to impairments of coronary heart disease, frequently  caused by atherosclerosis. Myocardial ischemia and myocardial infarction are  responsible for the most cases of SCD above this age (80%). Pre-participatory  athletes\' evaluation helps to recognize situations that may put the athlete\'s  life in risk including cardiovascular diseases. In summary, cardiologic  examinations of athletes\' pre-competition routine is an important way to  minimize the risk of SCD.', 'Sudden cardiac death in athletes is usually due to underlying cardiovascular  disease. In the young less than 30 years of age, the most common abnormality is  hypertrophic cardiomyopathy, followed by congenital coronary artery anomalies.  The final common pathway is usually ventricular fibrillation. Sudden cardiac  death in the young is rare but remains a source of concern. A careful screening  history and physical examination, especially for potential athletes, should  identify the majority of young people at risk.']",One of several causes of sudden cardiac death in athletes is  long QT syndrome
41,Which genes are affected in ROMANO-WARD syndrome?,"['BACKGROUND: Loss-of-function mutations in the gene KCNQ1 encoding the Kv7.1 K(+)  channel cause long QT syndrome type 1 (LQT1), whereas gain-of-function mutations  are associated with short QT syndrome as well as familial atrial fibrillation  (FAF). However, KCNQ1 mutation pleiotropy, which is capable of expressing both  LQT1 and FAF, has not been demonstrated for a discrete KCNQ1 mutation. The  genotype-phenotype relationship for a family with FAF suggests a possible  association with the LQT1 p.Arg231Cys-KCNQ1 (R231C-Q1) mutation. OBJECTIVE: The purpose of this study was to determine whether R231C-Q1 also can  be linked to FAF. METHODS: The R231C-Q1 proband with AF underwent genetic testing for possible  mutations in 10 other AF-linked genes plus KCNH2 and SCN5A. Sixteen members from  five other R231C-positive LQT1 families were genetically tested for 21 single  nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) to determine if the FAF family had  discriminatory SNPs associated with AF. R231C-Q1 was expressed with KCNE1 (E1)  in HEK293 cells, and Q1E1 currents (I(Q1E1)) were analyzed using the whole-cell  patch-clamp technique. RESULTS: Genetic analyses revealed no additional mutations or discriminatory  SNPs. Cells expressing WT-Q1 and R231C-Q1 exhibited some constitutively active  I(Q1E1) and smaller maximal I(Q1E1) compared to cells expressing WT-Q1. CONCLUSION: Constitutively active I(Q1E1) and a smaller peak I(Q1E1) are common  features of FAF-associated and LQT1-associated mutations, respectively. These  data suggest that the mixed functional properties of R231C-Q1 may predispose  some families to LQT1 or FAF. We conclude that R231C is a pleiotropic missense  mutation capable of LQT1 expression, AF expression, or both.', 'Long QT syndrome type 1 (LQT1) causes torsades de pointes arrhythmia,  ventricular fibrillation, and sudden death. It usually is inherited as an  autosomal dominant trait (Romano-Ward syndrome). The primary defect in LQT1 is a  mutation in KVLQT1, a gene that encodes the pore-forming alpha-subunit of a K+  channel. KvLQT1 alpha-subunits coassemble with minK beta-subunits to form  channels that conduct the slow delayed rectifier K+ current (I(Ks)) in the  heart. Recessive mutations in KVLQT1 cause Jervell and Lange-Nielsen syndrome,  which is characterized by more severe arrhythmias and congenital neural  deafness. Heterologous expression studies demonstrated that mutations in KVLQT1  reduce I(Ks) by causing loss of channel function, altered channel gating, and/or  a dominant-negative effect. It remains to be proven that an understanding of the  molecular basis of LQT1 will lead to more effective therapy.', 'Mutations in the KCNQ1, HERG, SCN5A, minK and MiRP1 genes cause long QT syndrome  (LQTS), of which there are two forms: the Romano Ward syndrome and the Jervell  and Lange-Nielsen syndrome. We have performed DNA sequencing of the  LQTS-associated genes in 169 unrelated patients referred for genetic testing  with respect to Romano Ward syndrome and in 13 unrelated patients referred for  genetic testing with respect to Jervell and Lange-Nielsen syndrome. A total of  37 different mutations in the 5 genes, of which 20 were novel, were identified.  Among patients with the most stringent clinical criteria of Romano Ward  syndrome, a mutation was identified in 71%. Twelve of the 13 unrelated patients  referred for genetic testing with respect to Jervell and Lange-Nielsen syndrome  were provided with a molecular genetic diagnosis. Cascade genetic screening of  505 relatives of index patients with molecularly defined LQTS identified 251  mutation carriers. The observed penetrance was 41%. Although caution must be  exerted, the prevalence of heterozygotes for mutations in the LQTS-associated  genes in Norway could be in the range 1/100-1/300, based on the prevalence of  patients with Jervell and Lange-Nielsen syndrome.', 'BACKGROUND: Anesthesia in patients with long QT syndrome (LQTS) is a matter of  concern. Congenital LQTS is most frequently caused by mutations in KCNQ1  (Kv7.1), whereas drug-induced LQTS is a consequence of HERG (human  ether-a-go-go-related gene) channel inhibition. The aim of this study was to  investigate whether the LQT1 mutation A344V in the S6 region of KCNQ1, at a  position corresponding to the local anesthetic binding site in HERG, may render  drug insensitive KCNQ1 channels into a toxicologically relevant target of these  pharmacologic agents. This may suggest that LQTS constitutes not only a  nonspecific but also a specific pharmacogenetic risk factor for anesthesia. METHODS: The authors examined electrophysiologic and pharmacologic properties of  wild-type and mutant KCNQ1 channels. The effects of bupivacaine, ropivacaine,  and mepivacaine were investigated using two-electrode voltage clamp and whole  cell patch clamp recordings. RESULTS: The mutation A344V induced voltage-dependent inactivation in homomeric  KCNQ1 channels and shifted the voltage dependence of KCNQ1/KCNE1 channel  activation by +30 mV. The mutation furthermore increased the sensitivity of  KCNQ1/KCNE1 channels for bupivacaine 22-fold (KCNQ1wt/KCNE1: IC50 = 2,431 +/-  582 microM, n = 20; KCNQ1A344V/KCNE1: IC50 = 110 +/- 9 microM, n = 24).  Pharmacologic effects of the mutant channels were dominant when mutant and  wild-type channels were coexpressed. Simulation of cardiac action potentials  with the Luo-Rudy model yielded a prolongation of the cardiac action potential  duration and induction of early afterdepolarizations by the mutation A344V that  were aggravated by local anesthetic intoxication. CONCLUSIONS: The results indicate that certain forms of the LQTS may constitute  a specific pharmacogenetic risk factor for regional anesthesia.', ""We describe a Swedish family with the proband and his brother suffering from  severe Romano-Ward syndome (RWS) associated with compound heterozygosity for two  mutations in the KVLQT1 (also known as KCNQ1 and KCNA9) gene (R518X and A525T).  The mutations were found to segregate as heterozygotes in the maternal and the  paternal lineage, respectively. None of the heterozygotes exhibited clinical  long QT syndrome (LQTS). No hearing defects were found in the proband. The data  strongly indicates that the compound heterozygosity for R518X and A525T is the  cause of an autosomal recessive form of RWS in this family. Our findings support  the implication of a higher frequency of gene carriers than previously expected.  We suggest that relatives of 'sporadic RWS' patients should be considered  potential carriers, at risk of dying suddenly from drug-induced LQTS."", 'BACKGROUND: BANK1 and BLK belong to the pleiotropic autoimmune genes; recently,  epistasis between BANK1 and BLK was detected in systemic lupus erythematosus.  Although BLK has been reproducibly identified as a risk factor in rheumatoid  arthritis (RA), reports are conflicting about the contribution of BANK1 to RA  susceptibility. To ascertain the real impact of BANK1 on RA genetic  susceptibility, we performed a large meta-analysis including our original data  and tested for an epistatic interaction between BANK1 and BLK in RA  susceptibility. PATIENTS AND METHODS: We investigated data for 1,915 RA patients and 1,915  ethnically matched healthy controls genotyped for BANK1 rs10516487 and rs3733197  and BLK rs13277113. The association of each SNP and RA was tested by logistic  regression. Multivariate analysis was then used with an interaction term to test  for an epistatic interaction between the SNPs in the 2 genes. RESULTS: None of the SNPs tested individually was significantly associated with  RA in the genotyped samples. However, we detected an epistatic interaction  between BANK1 rs3733197 and BLK rs13277113 (P(interaction) \u200a=\u200a0.037). In  individuals carrying the BLK rs13277113 GG genotype, presence of the BANK1  rs3733197 G allele increased the risk of RA (odds ratio 1.21 [95% confidence  interval 1.04-1.41], P\u200a=\u200a0.015. Combining our results with those of all other  studies in a large trans-ethnic meta-analysis revealed an association of the  BANK1 rs3733197 G allele and RA (1.11 [1.02-1.21], P\u200a=\u200a0.012). CONCLUSION: This study confirms BANK1 as an RA susceptibility gene and for the  first time provides evidence for epistasis between BANK1 and BLK in RA. Our  results illustrate the concept of pleiotropic epistatic interaction, suggesting  that BANK1 and BLK might play a role in RA pathogenesis.', 'Baller-Gerold syndrome (BGS) is a rare autosomal recessive condition with radial  aplasia/hypoplasia and craniosynostosis (OMIM 218600). Of >20 cases reported so  far, a few appear atypical and have been reassigned to other nosologic entities,  including Fanconi anaemia, Roberts SC phocomelia, and Pfeiffer syndromes after  demonstration of corresponding cytogenetic or molecular abnormalities. Clinical  overlap between BGS, Rothmund-Thomson syndrome (RTS), and RAPADILINO syndrome is  noticeable. Because patients with RAPADILINO syndrome and a subset of patients  with RTS have RECQL4 mutations, we reassessed two previously reported BGS  families and found causal mutations in RECQL4 in both. In the first family, four  affected offspring had craniosynostosis and radial defect and one of them  developed poikiloderma. In this family, compound heterozygosity for a R1021W  missense mutation and a g.2886delT frameshift mutation of exon 9 was found. In  the second family, the affected male had craniosynostosis, radial ray defect,  poikiloderma, and short stature. He had a homozygous splice site mutation  (IVS17-2A>C). In both families, the affected offspring had craniosynostosis,  radial defects, and growth retardation, and two developed poikiloderma. Our  results confirm that BGS in a subgroup of patients is due to RECQL4 mutations  and could be integrated into a clinical spectrum that encompasses RTS and  RAPADILINO syndrome.', 'Arachnomelia syndrome (AS), mainly found in Brown Swiss and Simmental cattle, is  a congenital lethal genetic malformation of the skeletal system. In this study,  a network-based disease gene prioritization approach was implemented to rank  genes in the previously reported ∼7 Mb region on chromosome 23 associated with  AS in Simmental cattle. The top 6 ranked candidate genes were sequenced in four  German Simmental bulls, one known AS-carrier ROMEL and a pooled sample of three  known non-carriers (BOSSAG, RIFURT and HIRMER). Two suspicious mutations located  in coding regions, a mis-sense mutation c.1303G>A in the bystin-like (BYSL) gene  and a 2-bp deletion mutation c.1224_1225delCA in the molybdenum cofactor  synthesis step 1 (MOCS1) gene were detected. Bioinformatic analysis revealed  that the mutation in MOCS1 was more likely to be the causative mutation.  Screening the c.1224_1225delCA site in 383 individuals from 12 cattle  breeds/lines, we found that only the bull ROMEL and his 12 confirmed progeny  carried the mutation. Thus, our results confirm the conclusion of Buitkamp et  al. that the 2-bp deletion mutation c.1224_1225delCA in exon 11 of the MOCS1  gene is causative for AS in Simmental cattle. Furthermore, a polymerase chain  reaction-restriction fragment length polymorphism (PCR-RFLP) was developed to  detect the causative mutation.', ""OBJECTIVE: Candidate gene association studies and genome-wide association  studies (GWAs) have identified a large number of single nucleotide polymorphisms  (SNPs) loci affecting susceptibility to rheumatoid arthritis (RA). However, for  the same locus, some studies have yielded inconsistent results. To assess all  the available evidence for association, we performed a meta-analysis on  previously published case-control studies investigating the association between  SNPs and RA. METHODS: Two hundred and sixteen studies, involving 125 SNPs, were reviewed. For  each SNP, three genetic models were considered: the allele, dominant and  recessive effects models. For each model, the effect summary odds ratio (OR) and  95% CIs were calculated. Cochran's Q-statistics were used to assess  heterogeneity. If the heterogeneity was high, a random effects model was used  for meta-analysis, otherwise a fixed effects model was used. RESULTS: The meta-analysis results showed that: (1) 30, 28 and 26 SNPs were  significantly associated with RA (P<0.01) for the allele, dominant, and  recessive models, respectively. (2) rs2476601 (PTPN22) showed the strongest  association for all the three models: OR\u200a=\u200a1.605, 95% CI: 1.540-1.672,  P<1.00E-15 for the T-allele; OR\u200a=\u200a1.638, 95% CI: 1.565-1.714, P<1.00E-15 for the  T/T+T/C genotype and OR\u200a=\u200a2.544, 95% CI: 2.173-2.978, P<1.00E-15 for the T/T  genotype. (3) Only 23 (18.4%), 13 (10.4%) and 15 (12.0%) SNPs had high  heterogeneity (P<0.01) for the three models, respectively.

In Apert  syndrome, characterised by syndactyly of the hands and feet, recurrent mutations  of a serine-proline dipeptide (either Ser252Trp or Pro253Arg) in the linker  between the IgII and IgIII extracellular immunoglobulin-like domains, have been  documented in more than 160 unrelated individuals. We have identified three  novel mutations of this dipeptide, associated with distinct phenotypes. A C-->T  mutation that predicts a Ser252Leu substitution, ascertained in a boy with mild  Crouzon syndrome (craniosynostosis with normal limbs) is also present in three  clinically normal members of his family. A CG-->TT mutation that predicts a  Ser252Phe substitution results in a phenotype consistent with Apert syndrome.  Finally, a CGC-->TCT mutation that predicts a double amino acid substitution  (Ser252Phe and Pro253Ser) causes a Pfeiffer syndrome variant with mild  craniosynostosis, broad thumbs and big toes, fixed extension of several digits,  and only minimal cutaneous syndactyly. The observation that the Ser252Phe  mutation causes Apert syndrome, whereas the other single or double substitutions  are associated with milder or normal phenotypes, highlights the exquisitely  specific molecular pathogenesis of the limb and craniofacial abnormalities  associated with Apert syndrome. Ser252Phe is the first noncanonical mutation to  be identified in this disorder, its rarity being explained by the requirement  for two residues of the serine codon to be mutated. The description of  independent, complex nucleotide substitutions involving identical nucleotides is  unprecedented, and we speculate that this may result from functional selection  of FGFR mutations in sperm.']","The genes involved in ROMANO-WARD syndrome are KCNQ1, KCNE1, KCNE2, KCNH2,  SCN5A, CAV3, SCN4B, AKAP9, SNTA1, KCNJ5 and  Ankyrin-B."
42,How does PRDM9 recognize the specific DNA motifs for meiotic recombination?,"['BACKGROUND: Genetic recombination plays an important role in evolution,  facilitating the creation of new, favorable combinations of alleles and the  removal of deleterious mutations by unlinking them from surrounding sequences.  In most mammals, the placement of genetic crossovers is determined by the  binding of PRDM9, a highly polymorphic protein with a long zinc finger array, to  its cognate binding sites. It is one of over 800 genes encoding proteins with  zinc finger domains in the human genome. RESULTS: We report a novel technique, Affinity-seq, that for the first time  identifies both the genome-wide binding sites of DNA-binding proteins and  quantitates their relative affinities. We have applied this in vitro technique  to PRDM9, the zinc-finger protein that activates genetic recombination,  obtaining new information on the regulation of hotspots, whose locations and  activities determine the recombination landscape. We identified 31,770 binding  sites in the mouse genome for the PRDM9(Dom2) variant. Comparing these results  with hotspot usage in vivo, we find that less than half of potential PRDM9  binding sites are utilized in vivo. We show that hotspot usage is increased in  actively transcribed genes and decreased in genomic regions containing H3K9me2/3  histone marks or bound to the nuclear lamina. CONCLUSIONS: These results show that a major factor determining whether a  binding site will become an active hotspot and what its activity will be are  constraints imposed by prior chromatin modifications on the ability of PRDM9 to  bind to DNA in vivo. These constraints lead to the presence of long genomic  regions depleted of recombination.', 'During mammalian meiosis, double-strand breaks are deliberately made throughout  the genome and then repaired, leading to the exchange of genetic material  between copies of chromosomes. How the locations of breaks are specified was  largely unknown until a fortuitous confluence of statistical genetics and  molecular biology uncovered the role of PRDM9, a DNA binding protein. Many  properties of this protein remain mysterious, however, including how it binds to  DNA, how it contributes to male infertility-both in humans, and in hybrid  mice-and why, in spite of its fundamental function in meiosis, its binding  domain varies extensively among humans and across mammals. We present a brief  summary of what has recently been learned about PRDM9 in different fields,  focusing on the puzzles yet to be resolved.', ""The DNA-binding protein PRDM9 directs positioning of the double-strand breaks  (DSBs) that initiate meiotic recombination in mice and humans. Prdm9 is the only  mammalian speciation gene yet identified and is responsible for sterility  phenotypes in male hybrids of certain mouse subspecies. To investigate PRDM9  binding and its role in fertility and meiotic recombination, we humanized the  DNA-binding domain of PRDM9 in C57BL/6 mice. This change repositions DSB  hotspots and completely restores fertility in male hybrids. Here we show that  alteration of one Prdm9 allele impacts the behaviour of DSBs controlled by the  other allele at chromosome-wide scales. These effects correlate strongly with  the degree to which each PRDM9 variant binds both homologues at the DSB sites it  controls. Furthermore, higher genome-wide levels of such 'symmetric' PRDM9  binding associate with increasing fertility measures, and comparisons of  individual hotspots suggest binding symmetry plays a downstream role in the  recombination process. These findings reveal that subspecies-specific  degradation of PRDM9 binding sites by meiotic drive, which steadily increases  asymmetric PRDM9 binding, has impacts beyond simply changing hotspot positions,  and strongly support a direct involvement in hybrid infertility. Because such  meiotic drive occurs across mammals, PRDM9 may play a wider, yet transient, role  in the early stages of speciation."", 'PR domain containing protein 9 (PRDM9) is a meiosis-specific, multi-domain  protein that regulates the location of recombination hotspots by targeting its  DNA recognition sequence for double-strand breaks (DSBs). PRDM9 specifically  recognizes DNA via its tandem array of zinc fingers (ZnFs), epigenetically marks  the local chromatin by its histone methyltransferase activity, and is an  important tether that brings the DNA into contact with the recombination  initiation machinery. A strong correlation between PRDM9-ZnF variants and  specific DNA motifs at recombination hotspots has been reported; however, the  binding specificity and kinetics of the ZnF domain are still obscure. Using two  in vitro methods, gel mobility shift assays and switchSENSE, a quantitative  biophysical approach that measures binding rates in real time, we determined  that the PRDM9-ZnF domain forms a highly stable and long-lived complex with its  recognition sequence, with a dissociation halftime of many hours. The ZnF domain  exhibits an equilibrium dissociation constant (K D) in the nanomolar (nM) range,  with polymorphisms in the recognition sequence directly affecting the binding  affinity. We also determined that alternative sequences (15-16 nucleotides in  length) can be specifically bound by different subsets of the ZnF domain,  explaining the binding plasticity of PRDM9 for different sequences. Finally,  longer binding targets are preferred than predicted from the numbers of ZnFs  contacting the DNA. Functionally, a long-lived complex translates into an  enzymatically active PRDM9 at specific DNA-binding sites throughout meiotic  prophase I that might be relevant in stabilizing the components of the  recombination machinery to a specific DNA target until DSBs are initiated by  Spo11.', ""In mammals, meiotic recombination occurs at 1- to 2-kb genomic regions termed  hotspots, whose positions and activities are determined by PRDM9, a DNA-binding  histone methyltransferase. We show that the KRAB domain of PRDM9 forms complexes  with additional proteins to allow hotspots to proceed into the next phase of  recombination. By a combination of yeast-two hybrid assay, in vitro binding, and  coimmunoprecipitation from mouse spermatocytes, we identified four proteins that  directly interact with PRDM9's KRAB domain, namely CXXC1, EWSR1, EHMT2, and  CDYL. These proteins are coexpressed in spermatocytes at the early stages of  meiotic prophase I, the limited period when PRDM9 is expressed. We also detected  association of PRDM9-bound complexes with the meiotic cohesin REC8 and the  synaptonemal complex proteins SYCP3 and SYCP1. Our results suggest a model in  which PRDM9-bound hotspot DNA is brought to the chromosomal axis by the action  of these proteins, ensuring the proper chromatin and spatial environment for  subsequent recombination events."", 'The programmed formation of hundreds of DNA double-strand breaks (DSBs) is  essential for proper meiosis and fertility. In mice and humans, the location of  these breaks is determined by the meiosis-specific protein PRDM9, through the  DNA-binding specificity of its zinc-finger domain. PRDM9 also has  methyltransferase activity. Here, we show that this activity is required for  H3K4me3 and H3K36me3 deposition and for DSB formation at PRDM9-binding sites. By  analyzing mice that express two PRDM9 variants with distinct DNA-binding  specificities, we show that each variant generates its own set of H3K4me3 marks  independently from the other variant. Altogether, we reveal several basic  principles of PRDM9-dependent DSB site determination, in which an excess of  sites are designated through PRDM9 binding and subsequent histone methylation,  from which a subset is selected for DSB formation.', ""The onset of prezygotic and postzygotic barriers to gene flow between  populations is a hallmark of speciation. One of the earliest postzygotic  isolating barriers to arise between incipient species is the sterility of the  heterogametic sex in interspecies' hybrids. Four genes that underlie hybrid  sterility have been identified in animals: Odysseus, JYalpha, and Overdrive in  Drosophila and Prdm9 (Meisetz) in mice. Mouse Prdm9 encodes a protein with a  KRAB motif, a histone methyltransferase domain and several zinc fingers. The  difference of a single zinc finger distinguishes Prdm9 alleles that cause hybrid  sterility from those that do not. We find that concerted evolution and positive  selection have rapidly altered the number and sequence of Prdm9 zinc fingers  across 13 rodent genomes. The patterns of positive selection in Prdm9 zinc  fingers imply that rapid evolution has acted on the interface between the Prdm9  protein and the DNA sequences to which it binds. Similar patterns are apparent  for Prdm9 zinc fingers for diverse metazoans, including primates. Indeed,  allelic variation at the DNA-binding positions of human PRDM9 zinc fingers show  significant association with decreased risk of infertility. Prdm9 thus plays a  role in determining male sterility both between species (mouse) and within  species (human). The recurrent episodes of positive selection acting on Prdm9  suggest that the DNA sequences to which it binds must also be evolving rapidly.  Our findings do not identify the nature of the underlying DNA sequences, but  argue against the proposed role of Prdm9 as an essential transcription factor in  mouse meiosis. We propose a hypothetical model in which incompatibilities  between Prdm9-binding specificity and satellite DNAs provide the molecular basis  for Prdm9-mediated hybrid sterility. We suggest that Prdm9 should be  investigated as a candidate gene in other instances of hybrid sterility in  metazoans."", 'PRDM9 is essential for the progression through early meiotic prophase, including  double strand break repair, homologous chromosome pairing, and sex body  formation during spermatogenesis. In order to evaluate the association of the  PRDM9 gene variants with defective spermatogenesis in the Chinese Han  population, we assessed two single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) in the PRDM9  gene (rs1874165 and rs2973631) using Sequenom iplex technology in 309 cases of  severely defective spermatogenesis (199 cases with non-obstructive azoospermia  and 110 cases with severe oligozoospermia) and 377 controls. The allele  frequencies of the SNPs were not statistically different between the study  groups and the controls (P =\u20090.95 in rs1874165 and P\u2009=\u20090.80 in rs2973631,  respectively). The genetic model analysis of the two SNPs indicated that these  SNPs variants may not be associated with defective spermatogenesis in the  Chinese Han population.', 'BACKGROUND: Genetic recombination plays an important role in evolution,  facilitating the creation of new, favorable combinations of alleles and the  removal of deleterious mutations by unlinking them from surrounding sequences.  In most mammals, the placement of genetic crossovers is determined by the  binding of PRDM9, a highly polymorphic protein with a long zinc finger array, to  its cognate binding sites. It is one of over 800 genes encoding proteins with  zinc finger domains in the human genome. RESULTS: We report a novel technique, Affinity-seq, that for the first time  identifies both the genome-wide binding sites of DNA-binding proteins and  quantitates their relative affinities. We have applied this in vitro technique  to PRDM9, the zinc-finger protein that activates genetic recombination,  obtaining new information on the regulation of hotspots, whose locations and  activities determine the recombination landscape. We identified 31,770 binding  sites in the mouse genome for the PRDM9(Dom2) variant. Comparing these results  with hotspot usage in vivo, we find that less than half of potential PRDM9  binding sites are utilized in vivo. We show that hotspot usage is increased in  actively transcribed genes and decreased in genomic regions containing H3K9me2/3  histone marks or bound to the nuclear lamina. CONCLUSIONS: These results show that a major factor determining whether a  binding site will become an active hotspot and what its activity will be are  constraints imposed by prior chromatin modifications on the ability of PRDM9 to  bind to DNA in vivo. These constraints lead to the presence of long genomic  regions depleted of recombination.', 'Meiotic recombination arises from Rec12/Spo11-dependent formation of DNA  double-strand breaks (DSBs) and their subsequent repair. We identified  Rec12-binding peaks across the Schizosaccharomyces pombe genome using chromatin  immunoprecipitation after reversible formaldehyde cross-linking combined with  whole-genome DNA microarrays. Strong Rec12 binding coincided with previously  identified DSBs at the recombination hotspots ura4A, mbs1, and mbs2 and  correlated with DSB formation at a new site. In addition, Rec12 binding  corresponded to eight novel conversion hotspots and correlated with crossover  density in segments of chromosome I. Notably, Rec12 binding inversely correlated  with guanine-cytosine (GC) content, contrary to findings in Saccharomyces  cerevisiae. Although both replication origins and Rec12-binding sites preferred  AT-rich gene-free regions, they seemed to exclude each other. We also uncovered  a connection between binding sites of Rec12 and meiotic cohesin Rec8.  Rec12-binding peaks lay often within 2.5 kb of a Rec8-binding peak. Rec12  binding showed preference for large intergenic regions and was found to bind  preferentially near to genes expressed strongly in meiosis. Surprisingly, Rec12  binding was also detected in centromeric core regions, which raises the  intriguing possibility that Rec12 plays additional roles in meiotic chromosome  dynamics.']",The PRDM9 gene encodes a protein with a highly variable tandem-repeat zinc finger (ZF) DNA-binding domain that plays a key role in determining sequence-specific hotspots of meiotic recombination genome wide. The long zinc finger domain of PRDM9 forms a highly stable and long-lived complex with its DNA recognition sequence.
43,Can clonidine be used to reduce agitation in children.,"[""BACKGROUND: This double-blind randomized study was undertaken to assess  agitation, Bispectral Index (BIS) and EEG changes during induction of  anaesthesia with sevoflurane in children premedicated with midazolam or  clonidine. METHODS: Children were allocated randomly to receive rectal midazolam 0.4 mg  kg(-1) (n=20) or oral clonidine 4 microg kg(-1) (n=20) as premedication. Rapid  induction of anaesthesia was achieved with inhalation of sevoflurane 8% in  nitrous oxide 50%-oxygen 50%. After tracheal intubation, the children's lungs  were mechanically ventilated and the inspired sevoflurane concentration was  adjusted to achieve an end-tidal fraction of 2.5%. The EEG and BIS were recorded  during induction until 10 min after tracheal intubation. The EEG was analysed  using spectral analysis at five points: baseline, loss of eyelash reflex, 15 s  before the nadir of the BIS (BIS(nadir)), when both pupils returned to the  central position (immediately before intubation), and 10 min after intubation. RESULTS: Agitation was observed in 12 midazolam-treated and five  clonidine-treated patients (P=0.05). At baseline, EEG rhythms were slower in the  clonidine group. Induction of anaesthesia was associated with similar EEG  changes in the two groups, with an increase in total spectral power and a shift  towards low frequencies; these changes were maximal around the end of the second  minute of induction (BIS(nadir)). When the pupils had returned to the central  position, fast EEG rhythms increased and BIS was higher than BIS(nadir)  (P<0.05). In both groups, agitation was associated with an increase in slow EEG  rhythms at BIS(nadir). CONCLUSIONS: Compared with midazolam, clonidine premedication reduced agitation  during sevoflurane induction. During induction with sevoflurane 8% (oxygen  50%-nitrous oxide 50%), the nadir of the BIS occurred at the end of the second  minute of inhalation. Agitation was associated with a more pronounced slowing of  the EEG rhythms at BIS(nadir) compared with inductions in which no agitation was  observed. The BIS may not follow the depth of anaesthesia during sevoflurane  induction in children."", 'Clonidine is experiencing increasing use in the pediatric population as a  sedative and analgesic because of its central alpha2-adrenergic agonism. We  report three cases of preoperative use of intranasal clonidine in pediatric  patients, all for different indications. One patient was treated for  preoperative agitation and hallucinations associated with oral midazolam. One  patient was given clonidine as a premedicant. The third patient was treated for  preoperative agitation and hypertension. All three patients had subjective  resolution of indicated symptoms and none experienced adverse outcomes.', 'BACKGROUND: Sevoflurane is commonly used as an inhalational induction agent in  paediatric patients. Emergence agitation is a common post-operative problem in  young children who have received sevoflurane. Clonidine has proven to be  effective in reducing the incidence of post-operative agitation at a higher dose  (3 and 2 μg kg⁻¹). It has some dose-dependent disadvantages, prominently  bradycardia, hypotension and respiratory impairment. OBJECTIVE: The authors conducted a study to evaluate the effectiveness of  low-dose caudal clonidine (1 μg kg⁻¹) in reducing the incidence of  sevoflurane-induced agitation in preschool children undergoing urogenital and  lower limb surgery. METHODOLOGY: A double-blind study was conducted comparing 0.25% (0.75 ml kg⁻¹)  bupivacaine and clonidine 1 μg kg⁻¹ (group 1), 0.25% bupivacaine (0.75 ml kg⁻¹)  and clonidine 0.75 μg kg⁻¹ (group 2), with 0.25% bupivacaine (0.75 ml kg⁻¹)  alone (group 3). Ninety children of 1-5 years of American Society of  Anesthesiologists I and II were randomly assigned into three groups.  Post-operatively, patients were monitored for 1 h to observe emergence  agitation, which was assessed with the help of Pain and Discomfort Scale. RESULT: Post-anaesthetic agitation was observed in two patients (6.6%) in group  1, eight patients (26.6%) in group 2 as compared to 12 patients (40%) in group 3  after 15 min of post-operative observation. The mean scores in group 1 at 15 and  30 min were significantly lower than those in group 3 (P value <0.05). None of  the groups had showed any haemodynamic and respiratory compromise, either  clinically and statistically. CONCLUSION: Caudal clonidine at a lower dose (1 μg kg⁻¹) could be effective in  reducing the incidence of sevoflurane-induced emergence agitation in children  undergoing urogenital and lower limb surgery without any significant adverse  effects.', ""BACKGROUND: This randomized, double-blind study tested the hypothesis that, in  comparison with midazolam, premedication with oral clonidine reduces the  incidence of emergence agitation in preschool children anaesthetized with  sevoflurane. METHODS: Sixty-eight ASA I-II children undergoing circumcision were randomized  into three groups to receive different oral premedication given 30 min before  anaesthesia: midazolam 0.5 mg kg-1, clonidine 2 microg kg-1, and clonidine 4  microg kg-1. Sevoflurane anaesthesia was administered via a facemask (O2/N2O:  40/60). Analgesia was with penile block (bupivacaine 0.5% 0.3 ml kg-1) and  rectal paracetamol (30 mg kg-1). During the first postoperative hour, children  were evaluated using a modified 'objective pain scale'. RESULTS: Only the 4 microg kg-1 dose of clonidine was associated with a  significant reduction in emergence agitation. Fewer children in the clonidine 4  microg kg-1 group displayed agitation (25%) than in the midazolam group (60%)  (P=0.025). Incidence of hypotension and bradycardia, time to first micturition  and first drink did not differ among groups. CONCLUSIONS: In comparison with midazolam, clonidine 4 microg kg-1 reduced  sevoflurane-induced emergence agitation without increasing postoperative  side-effects."", 'BACKGROUND: In children, sevoflurane anaesthesia is associated with  postanaesthetic agitation, which is treated mainly with opioids. We compared the  effectiveness of epidural and i.v. clonidine in the prevention of this  postanaesthetic agitation. METHODS: Eighty children aged 3-8 yr (ASA I-II) received standardized general  anaesthesia with inhaled sevoflurane and caudal epidural block with 0.175%  bupivacaine 1 ml kg-1 for minor surgery. The children were assigned randomly to  four groups: (I) clonidine 1 microgram kg-1 added to caudal bupivacaine; (II)  clonidine 3 micrograms kg-1 added to caudal bupivacaine; (III) clonidine 3  micrograms kg-1 i.v. and caudal bupivacaine; and (IV) caudal block with  bupivacaine, no clonidine (control). A blinded observer assessed the behaviour  of the children during the first postoperative hour. Secondary end-points were  the time to fitness for discharge from the postanaesthesia care unit, and  haemodynamic and respiratory variables. RESULTS: The incidence of agitation was 22, 0, 5 and 39% in groups I, II, III  and IV respectively (P < 0.05 for groups II and III compared with group IV).  During the first hour after surgery, patients in groups II and III had  significantly lower scores for agitation than group IV patients. Time to fitness  for discharge did not differ between the four groups. CONCLUSIONS: Clonidine 3 micrograms kg-1 prevented agitation after sevoflurane  anaesthesia, independently of the route of administration. The effect of  clonidine appears to be dose-dependent, as an epidural dose of 1 microgram kg-1  failed to reduce it.', 'OBJECTIVE: To evaluate safety and tolerability of four doses of  immediate-release molindone hydrochloride in children with  attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) and serious conduct problems. METHODS: This open-label, parallel-group, dose-ranging, multicenter trial  randomized children, aged 6-12 years, with ADHD and persistent, serious conduct  problems to receive oral molindone thrice daily for 9-12 weeks in four treatment  groups: Group 1-10 mg (5 mg if weight <30 kg), group 2-20 mg (10 mg if <30 kg),  group 3-30 mg (15 mg if <30 kg), and group 4-40 mg (20 mg if <30 kg). The  primary outcome measure was to evaluate safety and tolerability of molindone in  children with ADHD and serious conduct problems. Secondary outcome measures  included change in Nisonger Child Behavior Rating Form-Typical Intelligence  Quotient (NCBRF-TIQ) Conduct Problem subscale scores, change in Clinical Global  Impressions-Severity (CGI-S) and -Improvement (CGI-I) subscale scores from  baseline to end point, and Swanson, Nolan, and Pelham rating scale-revised  (SNAP-IV) ADHD-related subscale scores. RESULTS: The study randomized 78 children; 55 completed the study. Treatment  with molindone was generally well tolerated, with no clinically meaningful  changes in laboratory or physical examination findings. The most common  treatment-related adverse events (AEs) included somnolence (n=9), weight  increase (n=8), akathisia (n=4), sedation (n=4), and abdominal pain (n=4). Mean  weight increased by 0.54 kg, and mean body mass index by 0.24 kg/m(2). The  incidence of AEs and treatment-related AEs increased with increasing dose.  NCBRF-TIQ subscale scores improved in all four treatment groups, with 34%, 34%,  32%, and 55% decreases from baseline in groups 1, 2, 3, and 4, respectively.  CGI-S and SNAP-IV scores improved over time in all treatment groups, and CGI-I  scores improved to the greatest degree in group 4. CONCLUSIONS: Molindone at doses of 5-20 mg/day (children weighing <30 kg) and  20-40 mg (≥ 30 kg) was well tolerated, and preliminary efficacy results suggest  that molindone produces dose-related behavioral improvements over 9-12 weeks.  Additional double-blind, placebo-controlled trials are needed to further  investigate molindone in this pediatric population.', 'Young children with fragile X syndrome (FXS) often experience anxiety,  irritability, and hyperactivity related to sensory hyperarousal. However, there  are no medication recommendations with documented efficacy for children under 5  years old of age with FXS. We examined data through a chart review for 45  children with FXS, 12-50 months old, using the Mullen Scales of Early Learning  (MSEL) for baseline and longitudinal assessments. All children had clinical  level of anxiety, language delays based on MSEL scores, and similar early  learning composite (ELC) scores at their first visit to our clinic. Incidence of  autism spectrum disorder (ASD) was similar in both groups. There were 11  children who were treated with sertraline, and these patients were  retrospectively compared to 34 children who were not treated with sertraline by  chart review. The baseline assessments were done at ages ranging from 18 to 44  months (mean 26.9, SD 7.99) and from 12 to 50 months (mean 29.94, SD 8.64) for  treated and not treated groups, respectively. Mean rate of improvement in both  expressive and receptive language development was significantly higher in the  group who was treated with sertraline (P < 0.0001 and P = 0.0071, resp.). This  data supports the need for a controlled trial of sertraline treatment in young  children with FXS.', 'Although the etiology of neurodevelopmental mental disorders remains obscure,  converging lines of evidence using animal modeling suggest a critical role for  activity-dependent neurodevelopmental processes during neonatal life. Here, we  report the behavioral effects of a novel technique designed to induce targeted,  transient disruption of activity-dependent processes in early development via  reduction of calcium-mediated neurotransmitter release. We examined the  post-pubertal behavioral effects of neonatal (postnatal day 7) medial prefrontal  cortex infusion of either vehicle or N-type and P/Q-type presynaptic  voltage-dependent calcium channel blockers (omega-conotoxins MVIIA and MVIIC  respectively; 6.8 and 45 pmol infused respectively) in rat pups. In a test of  amphetamine-induced behavioral sensitization, neonatal omega-conotoxin MVIIA  treatment significantly increased locomotion following repeated amphetamine  injections (1.5 mg/kg i.p.) and significantly decreased locomotion following  repeated saline injections relative to animals treated neonatally with vehicle.  However, there was no effect of conotoxin treatment on the long-term expression  of amphetamine sensitization. Neonatal treatment with omega-conotoxins had no  effect on the other behaviors assayed, namely, acoustic startle response,  prepulse inhibition of startle, novelty- and amphetamine-induced (1.5 mg/kg  i.p.) locomotion, and anxiety-like behavior in the elevated plus-maze. These  data confirm that transient, region-specific disruption of synaptic transmission  during early development can have long-term effects on behaviors relevant to  neurodevelopmental mental disorders.', 'Failure of dental treatment due to anxiety is a common problem in children. The  aim of this study was to establish whether the use of a combination of  intravenous midazolam with inhalation agents (nitrous oxide alone or in  combination with sevoflurane) was any more likely to result in successful  completion of treatment than midazolam alone. A further aim was to evaluate the  clinical viability of these techniques as an alternative to general anaesthesia.  In total, 697 children too anxious for management with relative analgesia and  requiring invasive dental procedure for which a general anaesthetic would  usually be required, were recruited and randomly assigned to one of three groups  given the following interventions: group 1 - a combination of inhaled medical  air and titrated intravenous midazolam, group 2 - a combination of inhaled 40%  nitrous oxide in oxygen and titrated intravenous midazolam, and group 3 - a  combination of an inhaled mixture of sevoflurane 0.3% and nitrous oxide 40% in  oxygen with titrated intravenous midazolam. The primary outcome measure was  successful completion of the intended dental treatment with a co-operative child  responsive to verbal commands. In group 1, 54% (94/174 children) successfully  completed treatment. In group 2, 80% (204/256 children) and in group 3, 93%  (249/267 children) completed treatment. This difference was significant at the  1% level. Intravenous midazolam, especially in combination with inhaled nitrous  oxide or sevoflurane and nitrous oxide, are effective techniques, with the  combination of midazolam and sevoflurane the one most likely to result in  successful treatment.', 'A family-based, cognitive behavioural treatment for anxiety in 47 children with  comorbid anxiety disorders and High Functioning Autism Spectrum Disorder (HFA)  was evaluated. Treatment involved 12 weekly group sessions and was compared with  a waiting list condition. Changes between pre- and post-treatment were examined  using clinical interviews as well as child-, parent- and teacher-report  measures. Following treatment, 71.4% of the treated participants no longer  fulfilled diagnostic criteria for an anxiety disorder. Comparisons between the  two conditions indicated significant reductions in anxiety symptoms as measured  by self-report, parent report and teacher report. Discussion focuses on the  implications for the use of cognitive behaviour therapy with HFA children, for  theory of mind research and for further research on the treatment components.']","Yes, clonidine is effective in prevention of post-anesthesia agitation in children."
44,What is evaluated with the Hydrocephalus Outcome Questionnaire?,"['PURPOSE: In the current literature, there are essentially no comparisons of  quality of life (QOL) outcome after endoscopic third ventriculostomy (ETV) and  shunt in childhood hydrocephalus. Our objective was to compare QOL in children  with obstructive hydrocephalus, treated with either ETV or shunt. METHODS: A cross-sectional survey was conducted at SickKids, Toronto of children  between ages five and 18 years, with obstructive hydrocephalus due to aqueductal  obstruction and no other brain abnormalities. Measures of QOL were the  Hydrocephalus Outcome Questionnaire and the Health Utilities Index Mark 3. A  subset of patients was given the Wechsler Intelligence Scales for Children  (WISC-IV). RESULTS: A total of 47 of 59 (80%) eligible patients participated (24 had ETV as  primary treatment, 23 had shunt as primary treatment), with a mean age of 12.1  years (standard deviation 3.9) at assessment. The ETV group was older at initial  surgery (p < 0.001) and had larger ventricle size at last follow-up (p = 0.047).  In all QOL measures, there were no significant differences between the ETV group  and shunt group (all p > or = 0.09). Treatment failure, hydrocephalus  complications, and the presence of a functioning ETV at assessment were not  associated with QOL differences. Among the 11 children (six ETV, five shunt) who  were given the WISC-IV, there were no significant differences between the scores  of the ETV group and shunt group (all p > or = 0.11). CONCLUSIONS: This is the first study to provide a meaningful comparison of QOL  after ETV and shunt in children. These preliminary results suggest that there is  no obvious difference in QOL after ETV and shunt.', 'PURPOSE: The long-term outcome in spina bifida-Chiari II-hydrocephalus complex  is poorly understood. Traditional neurosurgical outcome measures are crude.  Neuropsychological testing is increasingly important in outcome assessment. We  investigated the health, disability, lifestyle and cognitive function in adults  who had myelomeningocoele closure at birth. METHODS: Adult patients under routine follow-up were assessed in a joint  neurosurgery/neuropsychology clinic. Patients completed lifestyle  questionnaires, the hydrocephalus outcome questionnaire (HOQ) and underwent  cognitive testing. Clinical variables including number of shunt revisions, shunt  infection and surgical decompression of foramen magnum, which may influence  outcome, were investigated. RESULTS: Twenty-one adults with a median age of 35 years were investigated. All  had treated hydrocephalus, and eight had foramen magnum decompression for  headache or progressive brainstem symptoms with stabilisation of symptoms in  seven and improvement in one. Only eight patients were living independently,  five were in paid employment and five work voluntarily. HOQ scores for cognitive  function were lower (0.56 ± 0.20; mean ± standard deviation (SD)) than those for  physical (0.64 ± 0.15) and social-emotional (0.65 ± 0.17) health. Cognitive  function varied across the cohort with attention most severely affected (73.9 ±  17.0; mean ± SD). Repeated episodes of shunt malfunction or foramen magnum  decompression were not associated with a worse cognitive function. CONCLUSIONS: Despite intervention in childhood and adequate cerebrospinal fluid  diversion the prognosis for independent living into adulthood remains poor. All  patients have elements of cognitive impairment. Structural brain abnormalities  may be more important determinants of cognitive outcome than shunt malfunction.', ""OBJECTIVE: To compare three separate methods for establishing interpretability  for a health status measure, the Hydrocephalus Outcome Questionnaire (HOQ). STUDY DESIGN AND SETTING: The mothers of children with hydrocephalus attending  the outpatient clinics at a pediatric hospital completed the HOQ (for which  scores can range from 0 to 1.0 with the smallest possible incremental change  being .005), the Health Utilities Index-2 (HUI-2), and a global rating of their  child's health. The surgeon for the child also provided a global rating of the  child's health following their visit. These data were used to calculate (i) the  minimal important difference (MID) based on global health ratings, (ii) the MID  based on an effect size approach, and (iii) the conversion of numerical HOQ  scores into health utility scores obtained from the HUI-2. RESULTS: Based on mothers' responses (n = 79) and surgeons' responses (n = 61),  respectively, the MID for the HOQ was estimated to be .12 and .10. Using the  effect size approach, the MID was estimated to be much lower at .03. HOQ scores  were found to be readily translatable to HUI-2 utility scores using a simple  linear transformation. The mean utility score for this sample of patients was  .77. CONCLUSIONS: Two methods for determining the MID yielded quantitatively  different results. Conversion of numerical health status scores to utility  scores was done successfully and providing another element of interpretability."", ""OBJECT: The Hydrocephalus Outcome Questionnaire (HOQ) is an established means of  measuring quality of life, but the cognitive component of this questionnaire has  never been formally compared with gold-standard neuropsychological test scores.  The authors hypothesized that the HOQ Cognitive Health score would demonstrate a  relatively strong correlation with neuropsychological test scores, whereas much  weaker correlations would be seen for HOQ Physical and Social-Emotional Health  scores. METHODS: A cross-sectional study of children with long-standing hydrocephalus  presenting to The Hospital for Sick Children's Neurosurgery Clinic was performed  between July 2006 and September 2008. Participating children and families  completed the HOQ and a battery of 21 standard neuropsychological tests and  questionnaires. Pearson correlation analysis was then performed. RESULTS: A total of 83 patients (81% participation) was accrued; the mean age  was 11.5 ± 3.4 years (mean ± SD) at the time of assessment. The mean age at  hydrocephalus treatment was 1.3 ± 2.6 years. The mean overall HOQ score was 0.69  ± 0.21. The HOQ Cognitive score had a moderate or strong correlation with 19  (90%) of 21 neuropsychological test scores, much more so than the HOQ  Social-Emotional score (5 moderate or strong correlations, 24%) and the HOQ  Physical score (1 moderate correlation, 5%). For 19 neuropsychological tests  (90%), the HOQ Cognitive score had a stronger correlation than the other scores.  The HOQ Cognitive score had particularly strong correlations with the Verbal IQ,  List Learning, Behavior Problems, and Metacognitive Abilities components. CONCLUSIONS: Data from a wide-ranging representative sample of children with  long-standing hydrocephalus provide added evidence of the validity of the HOQ  Cognitive score and the overall domain structure of the HOQ itself."", 'This study exampled the properties of a child-completed version of the  Hydrocephalus Outcome Questionnaire (cHOQ) and compared these with parental  responses to the HOQ (parent version). This was a cross-sectional study in the  outpatient clinics at three Canadian paediatric hospitals (Toronto, Vancouver,  and Halifax). All cognitively-capable children with previously treated  hydrocephalus who were aged between 6 and 19 years were eligible. Parents  completed the HOQ and the Health Utilities Index Mark 3; children completed the  cHOQ. A total of 273 children participated (146 males, 127 females; mean age 14  y 1 mo, SD 2 y 7 mo). Internal consistency of the cHOQ was 0.93 and test-retest  reliability was 0.86 (95% confidence interval 0.78-0.92). Mother-child agreement  and father-child agreement were 0.57 (0.40-0.68) and 0.62 (0.48-0.73)  respectively. Agreement was higher for assessments of physical health, but lower  for assessments of cognitive health and social-emotional health. There was  greater parent-child agreement for older children. When there was disagreement,  it seemed that children tended to rate their health better than their parents  did. In older children with hydrocephalus, the cHOQ appears to be a  scientifically reliable means of assessing long-term outcome. The differences in  child and parent perceptions of health need to be appreciated when conducting  outcome studies in this population.', 'PURPOSE: We evaluated the relationships between the cerebral metabolic rate of  glucose (CMRglu) measured by dynamic (18)F-fluorodeoxyglucose (FDG) positron  emission tomography/computed tomography (PET/CT) and the clinical and  neuropsychological assessment before and after the surgical procedure in  idiopathic normal pressure hydrocephalus (INPH) patients. METHODS: Eleven selected INPH patients underwent clinical assessment (modified  Rankin scale, Krauss scale, Larsson categorization system and Stein-Langfitt  scale), cognitive evaluation (Mini-Mental State Examination, MMSE) and dynamic  (18)F-FDG PET/CT scan 3 days before and 1 week after ventricular shunt  placement. RESULTS: After shunting, the global CMRglu significantly increased (2.95 ± 0.44  vs 4.38 ± 0.68, p = 10(-7)) in all INPH patients with a mean percentage value of  48.7%. After shunting, no significant change was found in the Evans ratio  whereas a significant decrease in all clinical scale scores was observed. Only a  slight reduction in the MMSE was found. After shunting, a significant  correlation between the global CMRglu value and clinical assessment was found (R  (2)\u2009= 0.75, p = 0.024); indeed all clinical scale scores varied (decreasing) and  the CMRglu value also varied (increasing) in all INPH patients. CONCLUSION: Our preliminary data show that changes in the CMRglu are promptly  reversible after surgery and that there is a relationship between the early  metabolic changes and clinical symptoms, independently from the simultaneous  changes in the ventricular size. The remarkable and prompt improvement in the  global CMRglu and in symptoms may also have important implications for the  current concept of ""neuronal plasticity"" and for the cells\' reactivity in order  to recover their metabolic function.', ""OBJECTIVES/HYPOTHESIS: Sinonasal Outcomes Test-22 (SNOT-22) is used widely as a  patient-reported sinonasal quality-of-life (QOL) instrument for endoscopic  endonasal pituitary surgery. However, it has never been validated in this  population. This study explores the psychometric validity of SNOT-22 to  determine if it is a valid scale in patients undergoing endoscopic pituitary  surgery. STUDY DESIGN: Multicenter prospective trial. METHODS: Adult patients (n\xa0=\xa0113) with pituitary tumors undergoing endoscopic  surgery were enrolled in a multicenter study. Patient-reported QOL was assessed  using SNOT-22 and the Anterior Skull Base Nasal Inventory-12. Face validity,  internal consistency, responsiveness to clinical change, test-retest  reliability, and concurrent validity were determined using standard statistical  methods. RESULTS: Internal consistency using Cronbach's alpha at baseline and 2\u2009weeks  postoperatively were 0.911 and 0.922, indicating SNOT-22 performed well as a  single construct. Mean QOL scores were significantly worse at 2\u2009weeks than  baseline (16.4\u2009±\u200915.1 vs. 23.1\u2009±\u200916.4, P\u2009<\u2009.001), indicating the scale is  responsive to clinical change. However, only 11/22 items demonstrated  significant changes in mean scores at 2\u2009weeks. Correlation between scores at 2  and 3\u2009weeks was high, suggesting good test-retest reliability, r(107)\xa0=\xa00.75,  P\u2009<\u2009.001. Factor analysis suggests the five-factor solution proposed for the  SNOT-22 in rhinosinusitis patients is not valid in pituitary surgery patients. CONCLUSIONS: The SNOT-22 is a valid QOL instrument in patients undergoing  endoscopic pituitary surgery. However, because it includes 22 items, can be  applied only as a single construct, 50% of the items do not demonstrate changes  after surgery, and is not as sensitive to change as other scales, shorter  instruments developed specifically for this patient population may be  preferable.

The aim of this study was to clarify the techniques and  methods facilitating the diagnosis of NPH. The literature review has been  conducted from the Medline database without date limitation including the  keywords ""normal pressure hydrocephalus"" and ""diagnosis."" They should appear in  the article title. From the 43 initially sorted, only 13 have been selected  using exclusion criteria. The proposed methods are very sparse and focused on  the improvement after surgical shunt. This focus is independent from the  diagnosis criteria proposed in 2005. This introduces an ambiguity in the  interpretation of the results. In practice, the diagnosis of NPH is more  difficult in the elderly population where differential diagnoses are frequent,  particularly vascular lesions (notably microangiopathy) and Alzheimer\'s disease.  The more invasive techniques as continuous spinal drainage (usually during 3  days) or some features of CSF dynamics (Rout, compliance) seem to be the best  predictors of after shunt improvement. However, these techniques are difficult  to use in routine in the elderly. The combination of Evans index and corpus  callosum angle on MRI is very useful to improve the differential diagnosis with  cerebral atrophy. Spinal tap test (lumbar puncture with the removal of 40 mL of  CSF) can be repeated two or three times for consecutive days to improve the  predictive value before shunting. Gait and balance often improve after shunt,  more than cognition and bladder disorders. In the elderly population, the  prognosis after 3 years is non conclusive despite initial improvement. Poor  prognosis seems to be due to associated pathologies in particular  neurodegenerative diseases. This should be considered in decision-making of CSF  shunt.', 'PURPOSE: We prospectively evaluated the regional cerebral metabolic rate of  glucose (CMRglu) before and after ventricular shunt placement in idiopathic  normal-pressure hydrocephalus (iNPH) patients, to investigate whether some brain  regions are more involved than others; we also correlated the individual  variations of CMRglu with the clinical scale score assessment after shunting. METHODS: Twenty iNPH patients (12 men; mean age 73 ± 9 years) underwent clinical  scale score assessment and F-FDG PET-CT before and 1 week after shunting. RESULTS: Before shunting, CMRglu values were similar in right and left brain  regions, as well as after shunting. After shunting, 17 of 20 iNPH patients were  clinically improved; all scale scores decreased, and CMRglu significantly  increased in all regions (P < 10). In 3 of 20 iNPH patients, the symptoms  persisted, the scale scores did not change, and CMRglu increased only in 3  regions: left frontal, left putamen, and right thalamus. Before shunting, no  difference in global CMRglu between clinically improved (n = 17) and not  improved (n = 3) iNPH patients was found. After shunting, a significant (P =  0.01) correlation between individual variations of CMRglu and clinical  assessment was found. CONCLUSIONS: These findings confirm that iNPH is a disease involving all  cerebral regions almost in the same way, and shunt procedure has a similar  effect on regional cerebral metabolism almost in the same way. Individual  variations of CMRglu are more important than absolute values and correlate with  clinical status after shunting. Clinical improvement depends not only on the  capability to restore the cerebrospinal fluid dynamic, but also on the ability  of cerebral parenchyma to recover the metabolic function.', 'INTRODUCTION: Idiopathic normal pressure hydrocephalus is a disease that most  frequently concerns subjects of an advanced age. It is not easy to establish a  definitive diagnosis, and the practitioner frequently encounters decision-making  problems regarding the following question: should a shunt be performed, or not?  Opinions remain contradictory, even though the available scientific data is  increasingly precise. The aim of this review is to analyze the physiopathogenic,  clinical, paraclinical and therapeutic data associated with this type of  hydrocephalus. CURRENT KNOWLEDGE AND KEY POINTS: If the clinical triad is determinant, no other  investigation is in fact necessary to confirm the diagnosis, although it should  always be questioned in the case of ventricular enlargement determined by  tomodensitometry. The decision to perform the only efficient procedure, i.e., a  ventricular shunt operation, depends upon a number of established arguments in  favor of that procedure. Clinical improvement, which is often spectacular, can  then confirm the diagnosis. FUTURE PROSPECTS AND PROJECTS: The efficacy of surgical treatment has been  confirmed by clinical studies, and there is a reduced tendency as regards  post-operative complications. However, each case should be considered  individually and with the cooperation of and coordination between the family,  the physician and the neurosurgeon.']","The Hydrocephalus Outcome Questionnaire (HOQ) is a simple, reliable, and valid measure of health status in children with hydrocephalus."
45,Which is the most prevalent form of arrhythmia worldwide?,"['Cardiac arrhythmias continue to pose a major medical challenge and significant  public health burden. Atrial fibrillation, the most prevalent arrhythmia,  affects more than two million Americans annually and is associated with a  twofold increase in mortality. In addition, more than 250,000 Americans each  year suffer ventricular arrhythmias, often resulting in sudden cardiac death.  Despite the high incidence and societal impact of cardiac arrhythmias, presently  there are insufficient insights into the molecular mechanisms involved in  arrhythmia generation, propagation, and/or maintenance or into the molecular  determinants of disease risk, prognosis, and progression. In addition, present  therapeutic strategies for arrhythmia abatement often are ineffective or require  palliative device therapy after persistent changes in the electrical and  conduction characteristics of the heart have occurred, changes that appear to  increase the risk for arrhythmia progression. This article reviews our present  understanding of the complexity of mechanisms that regulate cardiac membrane  excitability and cardiac function and explores the role of derangements in these  mechanisms that interact to induce arrhythmogenic substrates. Approaches are  recommended for future investigations focused on providing new mechanistic  insights and therapeutic interventions.', 'INTRODUCTION AND OBJECTIVES: Atrial fibrillation is the most prevalent sustained  arrhythmia. This paper estimates the burden and cost of illness attributable to  atrial fibrillation in Portugal based on demographic and health statistics. METHODS: Mortality data by cause of death came from the European Detailed  Mortality Database of the World Health Organization (WHO). Hospital data were  taken from the Portuguese diagnosis-related groups database. The burden of  disease was measured using DALYs (disability-adjusted life years), a metric  adopted by the WHO. Costs studied included resource use and lost productivity.  The burden and cost of illness are those attributable to atrial fibrillation and  its main complication, ischemic stroke. RESULTS: In Portugal, 4070 deaths were attributable to atrial fibrillation in  2010, corresponding to 3.8% of all deaths. In total, the burden of disease  attributable to atrial fibrillation was estimated at 23,084 DALYs: 10,521  resulting from premature deaths (1.7% of the total DALYs due to death in 2010 in  Portugal), and 12,563 resulting from disability. The total estimated direct  costs attributable to atrial fibrillation at 2013 prices were €115 million: €34  million for inpatient care and €81 million for outpatient care. Indirect costs  resulting from lost production due to disability were estimated at €25 million. CONCLUSIONS: Atrial fibrillation has an important social impact in Portugal due  to its associated mortality and morbidity, and was responsible in 2013 for a  total cost of €140 million, about 0.08% of gross domestic product.', 'Atrial fibrillation (AF) is the most prevalent sustained cardiac arrhythmia in  clinical practice associated with significant morbidity and mortality. With the  growing number of the affected individuals, the development of safe and  effective treatment options for AF has become a worldwide priority. Currently  available antiarrhythmic medications for the restoration and maintenance of  sinus rhythm have limitations due to the modest efficacy and a potential for  adverseeffects. Although substantial progress has been made in AF-ablation  techniques, broad application of these nonpharmacological treatment modalities  is limited and antiarrhythmic drug treatment is still the cornerstone and the  first-line therapy for the majority of AF patients. Improvements in the  understanding of the principal pathophysiological mechanisms of AF obtained in  the last several years have provided promising treatment opportunities. New  therapeutic options are based on the more selective targeting of ion channels  and intercellular connection proteins predominantly expressed in the atria, the  restoration of intracellular Ca(2+) homeostasis and the prevention of  AF-associated electrical and structural remodeling. In this review, we provide a  highlight of the most important pathophysiological mechanisms in AF with a  relation to the potential therapeutic interventions, and discuss novel findings  regarding the current and future pharmacological AF management and recent  patents.', ""Atrial fibrillation is the most common arrhythmia affecting patients today.  Disease prevalence is increasing at an alarming rate worldwide, and is  associated with often catastrophic and costly consequences, including heart  failure, syncope, dementia, and stroke. Therapies including anticoagulants,  anti-arrhythmic medications, devices, and non-pharmacologic procedures in the  last 30 years have improved patients' functionality with the disease.  Nonetheless, it remains imperative that further research into AF epidemiology,  genetics, detection, and treatments continues to push forward rapidly as the  worldwide population ages dramatically over the next 20 years."", ""Atrial fibrillation (AF) is the most common cardiac arrhythmia affecting up to  1-1.5% of the population. Regular physical activity reduces the risk of  cardiovascular diseases, however several studies have shown paradoxically  increased incidence of AF in people practicing sport, especially in elite  athletes. The results of studies suggest a U-shape relationship between sport  and risk of arrhythmia. Minor regular exertion protects from arrhythmia through  reduction in AF risk factors, while intense physical activity increases the risk  of arrhythmia. The etiopathogenesis of arrhythmia in athletes has not been fully  elucidated yet, but it is definitely multifactorial. Arrhythmia's occurrence may  be related to adaptative remodeling of a heart, autonomic nervous system  alteration as well as may be associated with other factors like inflammation or  dyselectrolitaemia. Atrial Fibrillation in athletes should always be considered  as an abnormality which requires further investigation as in small percentage of  cases arrhythmia may be the first manifestation of a structural heart disease or  chanellopathy potentially leading to sudden cardiac death. Taking into account  several problems related to pharmacotherapy, AF ablation has become the first  line treatment in athletes."", 'BACKGROUND: Bidirectional ventricular tachycardia (BVT), which is characterized  by an alternating beat-to-beat ECG QRS axis, is a rare but intriguing arrhythmia  associated with digitalis toxicity, familial catecholaminergic polymorphic  ventricular tachycardia (CPVT), and several other conditions that predispose  cardiac myocytes to delayed afterdepolarizations (DADs) and triggered activity.  Evidence from human and animal studies attributes BVT to alternating ectopic  foci originating from the distal His-Purkinje system in the left and/or right  ventricle, respectively. OBJECTIVE: The purpose of this study was to evaluate a simple ""ping pong"" model  of reciprocating bigeminy to explain BVT. METHODS: We constructed a two-dimensional anatomic model of the rabbit  ventricles with a simplified His-Purkinje system, in which different sites in  the His-Purkinje system had different heart rate thresholds for DAD-induced  bigeminy. RESULTS: When the heart rate exceeded the threshold for bigeminy at the first  site in the His-Purkinje system, ventricular bigeminy developed, causing the  heart rate to accelerate and exceed the threshold for bigeminy at the second  site. Thus, the triggered beat from the first site induced a triggered beat from  the second site. The triggered beat from the second site next reciprocated by  inducing a triggered beat from the first site, and so forth. Bigeminy from two  sites produced BVT, and that from three or more sites produced polymorphic VT. CONCLUSION: This ""ping pong"" mechanism of reciprocating bigeminy readily  produces the characteristic ECG pattern of BVT and its degeneration to  polymorphic VT if additional sites develop bigeminy.', 'The incidence of sudden cardiac death (SCD) among young athletes is estimated to  be 1-3 per 100,000 person years, and may be underestimated. The risk of SCD in  athletes is higher than in non-athletes because of several factors associated  with sports activity that increase the risk in people with an underlying  cardiovascular abnormality. A clear gender difference in the incidence of SCD  exists in young athletes, with the risk in male athletes being up to 9 times  higher than in female athletes. The most common causes of SCD in young athletes  is underlying inherited/congenital cardiac disease, such as cardiomyopathies,  congenital coronary anomalies and ion channelopathies. Blunt chest trauma also  may cause ventricular fibrillation in a structurally normal heart, known as  commotio cordis. Although geographical differences in the causes of SCD in young  athletes have been reported, these disparities are more likely to be related to  the type and implementation of pre-participation screening leading to the  identification of athletes at risk, rather than reflecting a truly different  ethiology. More studies are needed to clarify the role of ethnicity in the  prevalence of diseases known to cause SCD in young athletes.', 'BACKGROUND: The problem of sudden death in the young is currently debated and  measures for prevention are being evaluated worldwide. Information on the  incidence and causes of sudden (cardiac) death in the young (1-40 years) is  essential for the development of these preventive strategies. METHODS: Incidence estimates and causes of death were determined using death  certificate data of out-of-hospital sudden deaths recorded by Statistics  Netherlands from 1996 to 2006. To define sudden death, International  Classification of Diseases codes were selected based on a systematic review of  the literature assessing the most common causes of sudden death in the young. RESULTS: The incidence of sudden death was 2.07 (2.06-2.07 per 100 000  person-years). The incidence was higher for men (2.86 per 100 000 person-years)  than for women (1.24 per 100 000 person-years) and increased by age. The  majority of sudden deaths was of cardiac origin. Sudden cardiac death incidence  was 1.62 (1.61-1.62 per 100 000 person-years). In 9% the cause of death remained  unexplained. CONCLUSION: The incidence of sudden death in the young is 2.07 per 100 000  person-years. Treatable cardiac causes (such as coronary atherosclerosis and  inherited cardiac diseases) are often underlying for the sudden death. This  information is helpful in the development of preventive strategies.', 'INTRODUCTION AND OBJECTIVES: Catecholaminergic polymorphic ventricular  tachycardia is a malignant disease, due to mutations in proteins controlling  Ca(2+) homeostasis. While the phenotype is characterized by polymorphic  ventricular arrhythmias under stress, supraventricular arrhythmias may occur and  are not fully characterized. METHODS: Twenty-five relatives from a Spanish family with several sudden deaths  were evaluated with electrocardiogram, exercise testing, and optional  epinephrine challenge. Selective RyR2 sequencing in an affected individual and  cascade screening in the rest of the family was offered. The RyR2(R420Q)  mutation was generated in HEK-293 cells using site-directed mutagenesis to  conduct in vitro functional studies. RESULTS: The exercise testing unmasked catecholaminergic polymorphic ventricular  tachycardia in 8 relatives (sensitivity\xa0=\xa089%; positive predictive value\xa0=\xa0100%;  negative predictive value\xa0=\xa093%), all of them carrying the heterozygous  RyR2(R420Q) mutation, which was also present in the proband and a young girl  without exercise testing, a 91% penetrance at the end of the follow-up.  Remarkably, sinus bradycardia, atrial and junctional arrhythmias, and/or giant  post-effort U-waves were identified in patients. Upon permeabilization and in  intact cells, the RyR2(R420Q) expressing cells showed a smaller peak of Ca(2+)  release than RyR2 wild-type cells. However, at physiologic intracellular Ca(2+)  concentration, equivalent to the diastolic cytosolic concentration, the  RyR2(R420Q) released more Ca(2+) and oscillated faster than RyR2 wild-type  cells. CONCLUSIONS: The missense RyR2(R420Q) mutation was identified in the N-terminus  of the RyR2 gene in this highly symptomatic family. Remarkably, this mutation is  associated with sinus bradycardia, atrial and junctional arrhythmias, and giant  U-waves. Collectively, functional heterologous expression studies suggest that  the RyR2(R420Q) behaves as an aberrant channel, as a loss- or gain-of-function  mutation depending on cytosolic intracellular Ca(2+) concentration.', 'BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: Nocturnal cardiac arrhythmias occur in patients with  obstructive sleep apnea (OSA), reportedly as a consequence of the autonomic  effects of recurrent apnea with subsequent oxygen desaturation. We have  investigated whether different patterns of OSA are associated with specific  arrhythmia during sleep. PATIENTS AND METHODS: Electrocardiographic (ECG) data recorded during  polysomnography (PSG) were analysed in 257 consecutive OSA patients to determine  the prevalence of cardiac rhythm disturbances, and to relate these to breathing  pattern (normal, apnea/hypopnea, recovering ventilation, snoring) and oxygen  saturation. RESULTS: Arrhythmias were found in 18.5% of patients. Patients with nocturnal  bradyarrhythmia (BA) had higher values of ventilatory disturbance  (apnea-hypopnea index [AHI] 58.8+/-36.8 vs 37.2+/-30.3, p=0.02), mean  desaturation amplitude (8.9+/-4 vs 5.9+/-3.4%, p=0.03), and a lower SaO(2) nadir  (69% vs 77%, p=0.003) than those without arrhythmia. The prevalence of BA in  patients with AHI>or=30/h was significantly higher than that observed in those  with AHI<30/h (7.8% vs 1.5%, respectively; chi(2)=5.61, p=0.01). In contrast,  patients with tachyarrhythmia (TA) had no significant differences in AHI, mean  desaturation amplitude or SaO(2) nadir than those without arrhythmia. No  associations were found between arrhythmia and the presence of comorbidity or  concomitant medical therapy, except for an association between tachyarrhythmia  and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) (odds ratio 2.53; 95%  confidence intervals 1.1-5.8, p=0.03). CONCLUSIONS: We conclude that while BA during sleep is associated with OSA  severity, concomitant COPD or beta(2)-treatment may play a role in the  development of TA during sleep.']","Atrial fibrillation (AF) is the most common arrhythmia worldwide, and it has a significant effect on morbidity and mortality. It is a significant risk factor for stroke and peripheral embolization, and it has an effect on cardiac function.

46,What is the inheritance of the glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase (G6PD) deficiency?,"['Glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase (G6PD) deficiency is the commonest red cell  enzymopathy in humans and has an X-linked inheritance. It has been reported from  India more than 30 years ago and the prevalence varies from 0-27% in different  caste, ethnic and linguistic groups. The major clinical manifestations are drug  induced hemolytic anemia, neonatal jaundice and chronic non-spherocytic  hemolytic anemia. Individuals with G6PD deficiency have a selective advantage  against falciparum malaria. Thirteen biochemically characterized variants have  been reported from India. At the molecular level, G6PD Mediterranean is the most  common deficient variant in the caste groups whereas, G6PD Orissa is more  prevalent among the tribal of India. The third common variant seen in India is  G6PD Kerala-Kalyan.', ""The aims of this study were to determine the prevalence of glucose-6-phosphate  dehydrogenase (G6PD) deficiency in the United Arab Emirates (UAE), to describe  the different mutations in the population, to determine its prevalence, and to  study inheritance patterns in families of G6PD-deficient individuals. All  infants born at Tawam Hospital, Al-Ain, UAE from January 1994 to September 1996  were screened at birth for their G6PD status. In addition, those attending  well-baby clinics during the period were also screened for the disorder.  Families of 40 known G6PD-deficient individuals, selected randomly from the  records of three hospitals in the country, were assessed for G6PD deficiency.  Where appropriate, this was followed by definition of G6PD mutations. Of 8198  infants, 746 (9.1%), comprising 15% of males and 5% of females tested, were  found to be G6PD deficient. A total of 27 families were further assessed: of  these, all but one family had the nt563 Mediterranean mutation. In one family,  two individuals had the nt202 African mutation. The high manifestation of G6PD  deficiency in women may be due to the preferential expression of the  G6PD-deficient gene and X-inactivation of the normal gene, and/or to the  presence of an 'enhancer' gene that makes the expression of the G6PD deficiency  more likely. The high level of consanguinity which, theoretically, should result  in a high proportion of homozygotes and consequently a higher proportion of  females with the deficiency, was not found to be a significant factor."", 'Mouse chimeras from embryonic stem cells in which the X-linked glucose  6-phosphate dehydrogenase (G6PD) gene had been targeted were crossed with normal  females. First-generation (F(1)) G6PD(+/-) heterozygotes born from this cross  were essentially normal; analysis of their tissues demonstrated strong selection  for cells with the targeted G6PD allele on the inactive X chromosome. When these  F(1) G6PD(+/-) females were bred to normal males, only normal G6PD mice were  born, because: (i) hemizygous G6PD(-) male embryos died by E10.5 and their  development was arrested from E7.5, the time of onset of blood circulation; (ii)  heterozygous G6PD(+/-) females showed abnormalities from E8.5, and died by  E11.5; and (iii) severe pathological changes were present in the placenta of  both G6PD(-) and G6PD(+/-) embryos. Thus, G6PD is not indispensable for early  embryo development; however, severe G6PD deficiency in the extraembryonic  tissues (consequent on selective inactivation of the normal paternal G6PD  allele) impairs the development of the placenta and causes death of the embryo.  Most importantly, G6PD is indispensable for survival when the embryo is exposed  to oxygen through its blood supply.', 'Glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase (G6PD) deficiency is an X-linked recessive  genetic defect that can cause hemolytic crisis. However, this disease affects  both males and females. In Turkey, the frequency of this enzyme deficiency was  reported to vary, from 0.25 to 18%, by the geographical area. Its prevalence in  the northern Black Sea region of Turkey is unknown. The aims of this study were  to assess the prevalence of G6PD deficiency in the northern region Turkey in  children and adults with hyperbilirubinemia and hemolytic anemia. This report  included a total of 976 G6PD enzyme results that were analyzed between May 2005  and January 2014. G6PD deficiency was detected in 5.0% of all patients. G6PD  deficiency was significantly less frequent in females (1.9%, 6/323) than in  males (6.6%, 43/653). G6PD deficiency was detected in 3.7% of infants with  hyperbilirubinemia, 9.2% of children, and 4.5% of adults with hemolytic anemia.  In both the newborn group and the group of children, G6PD deficiency was  significantly more frequent in males. In the combined group of children (groups  I and II), the proportion of males was 74% and 67% in all groups (P = .0008). In  conclusion, in northern region of Turkey, G6PD deficiency is an important cause  of neonatal hyperbilirubinemia and hemolytic crisis in children and adults. This  study suggests that most pediatricians thought that G6PD deficiency is  exclusively a male disease. For this reason, some female patients may have been  undiagnosed.', 'After having described in detail the pathophysiology, symptomatology,  X-chromosomal inheritance and some laboratory methods in detecting  G-6-PD-deficiency by demonstrating a case of favism (Schulz et al. 1977), the  authors now discuss the particularities of the enzyme deficiency in the newborn.  These are complicated by additional physiological and transient deficiency of  the enzymes catalase, NAD-diaphorase, glutathione peroxidase, and glucuronyl  transferase. Several chemical substances, acidosis, hypoxia, hypoglycemia, and  immaturity may cause a severe hyperbilirubinemia in G-6-PD-deficient newborns.  The development of a kern-icterus in these cases may be prevented by early  exchange transfusion. From clinical findings and some observations in different  regions of Greece an additional factor influencing the liver function has been  postulated which favors the development of hyperbilirubinemias in  G-6-PD-deficient newborns. The nature of this possible factor is discussed. The  authors emphasize the necessity of screening for G-6-PD-deficiency during  pregnancy in families of mediterranian descent.', 'BACKGROUND: Glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase (G6PD) is a metabolic enzyme  involved in the pentose phosphate pathway, its especially important in red blood  cell metabolism. Glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase deficiency is an X-linked  recessive hereditary disease characterised by abnormally low levels of G6PD.  About 400 million people worldwide have a deficiency of this enzyme. The  remarkable geographic correlation of G6PD deficiency distribution with  historical endemicity patterns of malaria has led to suggestions that the two  could be linked. Some studies have concluded that G6PD deficiency confers  resistance to malaria. OBJECTIVE: To determine the prevalence of G6PD deficiency, and determine its  relationship with prevalence and incidence of P. falciparum infection among  children in Uganda. METHODS: This was longitudinal study involving 245 children, 135 were actively  followed up for 12 months. G6PD status was assessed for using PCR-RFLP method. A  thick smear was done to determine presence of plasmodium trophozoites and  parasite densities. RESULTS: A total of 245 children between 6 months and 9 years were recruited. Of  these 46.5% were males. Overall prevalence for the X-linked G6PD A- mutation  was; 79.59% wild type, 12.65% heterozygous and 7.76% homozygous or hemizygous.  Among the males 14% were hemizygous. At baseline, 40.8% had asymptomatic P  falciparum infection. There was no statistically significant difference in  prevalence and incidence rates of malaria infection among the different G6PD  genotypes with prevalence among heterozygous, homozygous, and wild type being  29%, 42.6% and 43% respectively (p\u2009=\u20090.11) and incidence among heterozygous and  wild type being 0.56 and 0.52 episodes/year (p\u2009=\u20090.5). The heterozygous G6PD A-  females had a lower parasite density compared to the wild type (2505 vs 941  parasites/μL; P\u2009=\u20090.024). CONCLUSIONS: This study showed that 20.41% of the population in this part of  Uganda carry the G6PD A-mutation, within the range of 15-32% seen in other parts  of Africa. P. falciparum infection incidence and prevalence rates are similar  among the G6PD genotypes though, once infected, P. falciparum parasite densities  are lowest among G6PD A- heterozygous females. This suggests differences in P.  falciparum infection rates and severity of disease could be mediated by  differences in parasite densities among the different G6PD genotypes.', 'We review here some recent data about Glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase (G6PD),  the housekeeping X-linked gene encoding the first enzyme of the pentose  phosphate pathway (PPP), a NADPH-producing dehydrogenase. This enzyme has been  popular among clinicians, biochemists, geneticists and molecular biologists  because it is the most common form of red blood cell enzymopathy. G6PD deficient  erythrocytes do not generate NADPH in any other way than through the PPP and for  this reason they are more susceptible than any other cells to oxidative damage.  Moreover, this enzyme has also been of crucial importance in many significant  discoveries; indeed, G6PD polymorphisms have been instrumental in studying  X-inactivation in the human species, as well as in establishing the clonal  nature of certain tumors. G6PD deficiency, generally considered as a mild and  benign condition, is significantly disadvantageous in certain environmental  conditions like in presence of certain drugs. Nevertheless, G6PD deficiency has  been positively selected by malaria, and recent knowledge seems to show that it  also confers an advantage against the development of cancer, reduces the risk of  coronary diseases and has a beneficial effect in terms of longevity.', 'Wallaroos (Macropus robustus robustus), which have the G6PD-F electrophoretic  phenotype, crossed with euros (M.r.erubescens), of G6PD-S phenotype, produced F1  animals which had only the maternal G6PD type regardless of the direction of the  cross. When F1 hybrids were backcrossed to wallaroos or euros, backcross progeny  of either perental phenotype resulted. Sex-linked inheritance of allelic G6PD  genes is shown to occur in wallaroos, euros and red kangaroos (M. rufus). Dose  compensation for X chromosomes at the G6PD locus in kangaroow is achieved by  inactivation of the allele of male parental origin.', 'Glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase (G6PD) deficiency is the most common human  enzyme defect. In this study, we aimed to perform a molecular investigation of  G6PD deficiency in Tunisia and to associate clinical manifestations and the  degree of deficiency with the genotype. A total of 161 Tunisian subjects of both  sexes were screened by spectrophotometric assay for enzyme activity. Out of  these, 54 unrelated subjects were selected for screening of the most frequent  mutations in Tunisia by PCR/RFLP, followed by size-based separation of  double-stranded fragments under non-denaturing conditions on a denaturing high  performance liquid chromatography system. Of the 56 altered chromosomes  examined, 75\xa0% had the GdA(-) mutation, 14.28\xa0% showed the GdB(-) mutation and  no mutations were identified in 10.72\xa0% of cases. Hemizygous males with GdA(-)  mutation were mostly of class III, while those with GdB(-) mutation were mainly  of class II. The principal clinical manifestation encountered was favism. Acute  hemolytic crises induced by drugs or infections and neonatal jaundice were also  noted. Less severe clinical features such as low back pain were present in  heterozygous females and in one homozygous female. Asymptomatic individuals were  in majority heterozygote females and strangely one hemizygous male. The spectrum  of mutations seems to be homogeneous and similar to that of Mediterranean  countries; nevertheless 10.72\xa0% of cases remain with undetermined mutation thus  suggesting a potential heterogeneity of the deficiency at the molecular level.  On the other hand, we note a better association of the molecular defects with  the severity of the deficiency than with clinical manifestations.', 'Glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase (G6PD) deficiency is the most frequent enzyme  deficiency. It is a sex-linked genetic disease concerning mostly african,  mediterranean and far-eastern populations. The main clinical expression is a  hemolytic anemia which can be acute or chronic. During the neonatal period the  disease may manifest as neonatal jaundice. We have been asked by the neonate  department to set up a blood screening test for this deficiency. We have  therefore developed a test using umbilical cord blood. The assay of G6PD has  been automatised and red blood cell aspartate-amino-transferase (ASAT) chosen as  a reference enzyme to evaluate the age of red blood cells. Normal values of  G6PD, ASAT and G6PD/ASAT ratio have been calculated from 235 cord samples.  Genetic frequency of this deficiency in 2002 was 6% in male and 1% in female  newborns.']",Glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase (G6PD) deficiency is the commonest red cell enzymopathy in humans and has a recessive X-linked inheritance.
47,What organ is associated with a Gleason pattern or Gleason Score?,"['BACKGROUND: To compare histological feature of prostate cancer (PCa) according  androgenic status in patients who underwent radical prostatectomy (RP). METHODS: Between March 2007 and September 2013, we prospectively analysed 937  patients who were referred to our centre for RP. Clinical, pathological and  biological data have been prospectively collected. Preoperative total  testosterone (TT) and bioavailable testosterone (BT) serum determinations were  carried out. The threshold for low serum testosterone was set at TT<3 ng/ml.  Preoperative PSA value was registered. Gleason score (GS) and predominant  Gleason pattern were determined in prostate biopsies and in prostate tissue  specimens, crosschecked by two uro-pathologists. RESULTS: Nine hundred and thirty-seven consecutive patients were included. In  all, 14.9% patients had low TT in the population. An exact match between biopsy  and prostate specimens in GS grading was observed for 50.6% patients (n=474).  Also, 40.9% of all patients were upgraded (n=383): 45.3% (n=63) in low serum  testosterone patients and 40.1% (n=320) in normal serum testosterone patients.  For prostate specimens, the proportion of patients with predominant Gleason  pattern 4 was higher in patients with low TT compared with normal TT (41.7% vs  29.1%, P=0.0029). In all, 20.1% were upgraded from predominant Gleason pattern 3  on biopsies specimen to predominant Gleason 4 pattern on the prostate specimen  in patients with low TT, whereas 11.6% were upgraded for normal TT patients  (P=0.002). CONCLUSIONS: Low serum testosterone is an independent risk factor for  predominant Gleason pattern 4 on prostate specimen after RP and for upgrading  from low- to high-grade cancer between prostate needle biopsies and RP specimen.  This observation should be taken into account in localised PCa management,  especially for active surveillance or when a nerve-sparing approach is  considered.', 'Reelin is a glycoprotein that plays a critical role in the regulation of  neuronal migration during brain development and, since reelin has a role in the  control of cell migration, it might represents an important factor in cancer  pathology. In this study, 66 surgical specimens of prostate cancer were analyzed  for reelin expression by immunohistochemical method. The reelin expression was  correlated with Gleason score and individual Gleason patterns. Reelin expression  was found in 39% prostate cancers. Stromal tissues, normal epithelial cells and  prostate intraepithelial neoplasia (PIN) of any grade around and distant from  cancer were always negative for reelin. Reelin was found in malignant prostatic  epithelial glands of 50% cases Gleason score 10, 52% Gleason score 9, 56%  Gleason score 8, 18% Gleason score 7, while no sample of prostate cancers with  Gleason score 6 showed reelin expression (P=0,005). As reelin staining is  frequently found in high Gleason score prostate cancers, we explored whether  reelin expression is influenced by single Gleason patterns. While Gleason 3  pattern did not show reelin immunoreactivity, reelin expression was found in 35%  Gleason 4 patterns and 45% Gleason 5 patterns (P<0.001). Our results  demonstrated for the first time that reelin is expressed in prostate cancer and  not in benign prostate tissue and its expression occurs in higher Gleason score  and correlates significantly with increasing of single Gleason patterns. This  suggests reelin may behave as a specific histological marker and may represent a  useful biomarker to predict aggressive phenotypic behavior of prostatic cancer  cells.', 'Patients with Gleason score 7 prostate cancer on radical prostatectomy  demonstrate a wide range in clinical outcome. Gleason grade 4 prostate cancer  encompasses a heterogeneous group of tumor growth patterns including fused,  ill-defined, cribriform, and glomeruloid glandular structures. Our objective was  to determine the prognostic value of different Gleason grade 4 growth patterns.  We performed a nested case-control study among 535 patients with Gleason score 7  prostate cancer at radical prostatectomy, treated between March 1985 and July  2013 at a university hospital in the Netherlands. We analyzed 52 cases (with  metastasis, disease-specific mortality or both) and 109 controls, matched for  age, PSA level, and pT stage. Presence of the following Gleason grade 4 patterns  was recorded: fused, ill-defined, cribriform, and glomeruloid. Intraductal  carcinoma of the prostate and tertiary Gleason grade 5 were additionally  assessed. Outcomes were metastasis-free survival and disease-specific survival.  We used Cox proportional hazards regression to determine the predictive value of  Gleason grade 4 patterns for survival time. The overall prevalence of Gleason  grade 4 patterns was as follows: fused 75% (n=121), ill-defined 64% (n=102),  cribriform 48% (n=83), and glomeruloid 25% (n=40). Cribriform pattern was the  only pattern with an unequal distribution between cases and controls. Forty-two  out of 52 cases (81%) had cribriform growth pattern versus 41/109 controls  (38%). In multivariate analysis, presence of cribriform growth was an adverse  independent predictor for distant metastasis-free survival (HR 8.0, 95% CI  3.0-21; P<0.001) and disease-specific survival (HR 5.4, 95% CI 2.0-15, P=0.001).  In conclusion, cribriform growth in Gleason grade 4 is a strong prognostic  marker for distant metastasis and disease-specific death in patients with  Gleason score 7 prostate cancer at radical prostatectomy.', 'OBJECTIVES: Most adenocarcinomas of the prostate with a Gleason score greater  than 8 at radical prostatectomy have extraprostatic extension and a high risk of  progression. With prostate-specific antigen screening, we have seen some cases  of earlier detected, organ-confined, high-grade adenocarcinoma. Few data are  available as to the likelihood of cure in these cases. METHODS: We reviewed 27 cases of pathologically organ-confined adenocarcinoma  with a prostatectomy Gleason score of 8 to 10. To exclude cases with a  significant proportion of Gleason pattern 3, we excluded cases of Gleason score  3+5=8 and Gleason score 5+3=8. All cases of Gleason score 8 at radical  prostatectomy were Gleason score 4+4. The prognostic value of the clinical  parameters (clinical stage, serum prostate-specific antigen level, age) and  pathologic factors (biopsy Gleason score, radical prostatectomy Gleason score,  prostatectomy tumor volume) were tested to predict postoperative progression. RESULTS: The mean age at diagnosis was 59.7 years (range 46 to 69) with  preoperative serum prostate-specific antigen levels ranging from 1.4 to 28 ng/mL  (mean 7.8). All tumors were classified as pathologic Stage T2N0Mx. Fifteen  patients (55.6%) had a Gleason score of 8, 11 patients (40.7%) had a Gleason  score of 9, and 1 had a Gleason score of 10 (3.7%). Tumor volumes ranged from  0.02 to 1.44 cm(3) (mean 0.56). Follow-up information was available for all men.  The mean follow-up for those without progression was 30.6 months (range 7 to 73)  and for those with progression was 23.6 months (range 9 to 44). The 33-month  actuarial risk of progression was 32%, with 10 men developing progression during  the study. None of the preoperative or postoperative variables predicted  progression. CONCLUSIONS: Even when high-grade tumor is organ confined, it is associated with  a relatively unfavorable short-term outcome that is not predictable on the basis  of either preoperative clinicopathologic data or postoperative pathologic  information obtained from the radical prostatectomy specimen.', 'If multiple biopsy cores contain prostate cancer with differing Gleason scores,  should an overall Gleason score be assigned, or should each core be graded  separately? We obtained data on 127 men with prostate cancer on needle biopsy  who underwent subsequent radical prostatectomy at our institution. We compared  the Gleason scores found on needle biopsy with the grade and stage  (organ-confined, extra-prostatic extension, positive seminal vesicles or lymph  nodes) at radical prostatectomy. On biopsy, 40 men had a pure Gleason score of 4  + 3 = 7, 25 men had a Gleason score of 4 + 3 = 7 with a Gleason score of 3 + 3 =  6 on a separate core of the biopsy specimen, 27 men had a pure Gleason score of  4 + 4 = 8, and 35 men had a Gleason score of 4 + 4 = 8 with separate cores  containing Gleason pattern grade 3. A Gleason score of 4 + 4 = 8 with pattern  grade 3 in other cores had a more advanced stage than a pure Gleason score of 4  + 3 = 7 (P = 0.008). There was no clear pattern analyzing pathological stage of  men with a pure Gleason score of 4 + 3 = 7 in comparison with those with Gleason  scores of 4 + 3 = 7 and 3 + 3 = 6 in other cores. The group with a Gleason score  of 4 + 4 = 8 and Gleason pattern grade 3 on other cores had a higher overall  grade on radical prostatectomy than the group with a pure Gleason score of 4 + 3  = 7 (P = 0.001). If one had assigned an overall Gleason score, then a biopsy  with Gleason score 4 + 4 = 8 on 1 or more cores and some pattern grade 3 in  other cores, would be designated as a Gleason score of 4 + 3 = 7. Based on our  findings, patients with a Gleason score of 4 + 4 = 8 on one or more cores with  pattern grade 3 in other cores should be given a final Gleason score of 4 + 4 =  8 instead of 4 + 3 = 7, because these patients are more likely to have higher  stage and grade on radical prostatectomy, comparable to a pure Gleason score of  4 + 4 = 8. Each core should be assigned a separate Gleason score, especially in  cases with high Gleason score cancer on at least 1 core.', 'We report the postmortem findings of two siblings with gross and microscopic  features consistent with IMAGe association (Intrauterine growth retardation,  Metaphyseal dysplasia, Adrenal hypoplasia congenita, and Genital anomalies) with  an emphasis on the histopathology of the adrenal gland in this rare syndrome.  The first sibling was an 8-week old male diagnosed postnatally with primary  adrenal insufficiency. There was no deletion of the DAX1 gene by FISH.  Examination at autopsy revealed dysmorphic features including frontal bossing,  epicanthal folds, flat philtrum, cryptorchidism, penile chordee, overriding  fourth toe, and height and weight below 3rd percentile. Grossly, the adrenal  glands were not identified; however, microscopic examination of the suprarenal  soft tissue revealed a 3 mm focus of disorganized fetal adrenal cortex with  distended ""cytomegalic"" cells with abundant pink eosinophilic cytoplasm,  vesicular nuclei, and cytoplasmic vacuolization. A minute focus of permanent  adult cortex was also seen, but no adrenal medulla was identified. An autopsy of  the sibling, who died 12 years previously at day 9 of life, revealed dysmorphic  facial features with cryptorchidism and a large phallus. The adrenal glands were  grossly hypoplastic (11 mm). Histologically, the adrenal glands showed  disorganized fetal cortex with cytomegalic cells, a larger amount of permanent  adult cortex, and bizarre nuclei with numerous pseudoinclusions. While there is  currently limited information regarding the histopathologic adrenal findings in  IMAGe association, our small case series suggests overlapping features between  X-linked recessive congenital adrenal hypoplasia (cytomegalic cells with lack of  permanent adult cortex) and autosomal recessive congenital adrenal hypoplasia  (diminished permanent adult cortex without cytomegalic cells).', ""Glioma risk has consistently been inversely associated with allergy history but  not with smoking history despite putative biologic plausibility. Data from 855  high-grade glioma cases and 1,160 controls from 4 geographic regions of the  United States during 1997-2008 were analyzed for interactions between allergy  and smoking histories and inherited variants in 5 established glioma risk  regions: 5p15.3 (TERT), 8q24.21 (CCDC26/MLZE), 9p21.3 (CDKN2B), 11q23.3  (PHLDB1/DDX6), and 20q13.3 (RTEL1). The inverse relation between allergy and  glioma was stronger among those who did not (odds ratio(allergy-glioma) = 0.40,  95% confidence interval: 0.28, 0.58) versus those who did (odds  ratio(allergy-glioma) = 0.76, 95% confidence interval: 0.59, 0.97;  P(interaction) = 0.02) carry the 9p21.3 risk allele. However, the inverse  association with allergy was stronger among those who carried (odds  ratio(allergy-glioma) = 0.44, 95% confidence interval: 0.29, 0.68) versus those  who did not carry (odds ratio(allergy-glioma) = 0.68, 95% confidence interval:  0.54, 0.86) the 20q13.3 glioma risk allele, but this interaction was not  statistically significant (P = 0.14). No relation was observed between glioma  risk and smoking (odds ratio = 0.92, 95% confidence interval: 0.77, 1.10; P =  0.37), and there were no interactions for glioma risk of smoking history with  any of the risk alleles. The authors' observations are consistent with a recent  report that the inherited glioma risk variants in chromosome regions 9p21.3 and  20q13.3 may modify the inverse association of allergy and glioma."", ""Mulibrey nanism (MUL) is a monogenic disorder with prenatal-onset growth  failure, typical clinical characteristics, cardiopathy and tendency for a  metabolic syndrome. It is caused by recessive mutations in the TRIM37 gene  encoding for the peroxisomal TRIM37 protein with ubiquitin-ligase activity. In  this work, the frequency and pathology of malignant and benign tumours were  analysed in a national cohort of 89 Finnish MUL patients aged 0.7-76 years. The  subjects had a clinical and radiological evaluation, and histological and  immunohistocemical analyses on specimens obtained from biopsy, surgery or  autopsy, were performed. The results show that the MUL patients have disturbed  architecture with ectopic tissues and a high frequency of both benign and  malignant tumours detectable in several internal organs. A total of 210 tumorous  lesions were detected in 66/89 patients (74%). Fifteen malignancies occurred in  13 patients (15%), seven of them in the kidney (five Wilms' tumours), three in  the thyroid gland, two gynaecological cancers, one gastrointestinal carcinoid  tumour, one neuropituitary Langerhans cell histiocytosis and one case of acute  lymphoblastic leukaemia (ALL). Tumours detected by radiology in the liver and  other organs mainly comprised strongly dilated blood vessels (peliosis),  vascularized cysts and nodular lesions. The lesions showed strong expression of  the endothelial cell markers CD34 and CD31 as well as the myocyte marker  alpha-smooth muscle actin (alpha-SMA). Our findings show that MUL is associated  with frequent malignant tumours and benign adenomatous and vascular lesions, as  well as disturbed organ development."", 'BACKGROUND: The ratio of the second to the fourth digit (2D:4D ratio) is a  sexually dimorphic trait established in utero that differs between ethnic  groups. It is associated with prenatal androgen exposure, and studies have  evaluated the ratio as a marker for certain traits and disease states known to  be associated with higher levels of in utero androgens, such as prostate cancer.  There are currently no screening tools that stratify men with prostate cancer  according to the severity of their disease. This study aims to investigate the  2D:4D ratio as a potential marker for prostate cancer severity. Our hypothesis  was that lower digit ratios, representing higher in utero androgen exposure,  would be associated with more severe disease. METHODS: Measurements were taken of the second and fourth digits of the right  hand of male patients diagnosed with prostate cancer. Gleason score, presence of  metastasis, family history, age at diagnosis and race were recorded. The  distribution of demographic and other patient characteristics were compared with  digit ratios to determine relationships. RESULTS: African-American men with prostate cancer are 3.70 times more likely to  have a low 2D:4D digit ratio than Caucasian men with prostate cancer (95%  confidence interval: 1.98, 6.92; P < 0.0001). There were no statistically  significant differences in the presence of metastasis, Gleason score, family  history or age at diagnosis by digit ratio. CONCLUSION: 2D:4D ratio shows strong differences between African-Americans and  Caucasians; however, it does not correlate with disease severity in men already  diagnosed with prostate cancer. Although this is a small population sample with  possible confounding factors, it does not provide evidence to support the  hypothesis that prenatal androgens affect prostate cancer grade or progression.', ""BACKGROUND: Research on early life exposures and testicular germ cell tumors  (TGCT) risk has focused on a possible perinatal etiology with a well-known  hypothesis suggesting that hormonal involvement during fetal life is associated  with risk. Second-to-fourth digit ratio (2D:4D) and left-hand dominance have  been proposed as markers of prenatal hormone exposure. AIM: To evaluate associations between 2D:4D digit ratio, right minus left 2D:4D  (ΔR-L), and left-hand dominance and TGCT in the U.S. Servicemen's Testicular  Tumor Environmental and Endocrine Determinants Study. METHODS: A total of 246 TGCT cases and 236 non-testicular cancer controls  participated in the current study, and completed a self-administered  questionnaire. Associations between digit ratio, hand dominance and TGCT were  estimated using unconditional logistic regression adjusting for identified  covariates. RESULTS: Right 2D:4D was not associated with TGCT [odds ratio (OR) for a  one-standard deviation (SD) increase in right-hand 2D:4D: 1.12, 95% confidence  interval (CI): 0.93-1.34]. The results were consistent when evaluating the  association based on the left hand. The difference between right and left-hand  2D:4D was also not associated with TGCT risk [OR for a one-SD increase in ΔR-L:  1.03, 95% CI: 0.87-1.23]. Compared to men who reported right-hand dominance,  ambidexterity [OR (95% CI)=0.65 (0.30-1.41)] and left-hand dominance [OR (95%  CI)=0.79 (0.44-1.44)] were not associated with risk. CONCLUSIONS: These results do not support the hypothesis that prenatal hormonal  imbalance is associated with TGCT risk. Given the limited sample size, further  evaluation of the relationship between TGCT and prenatal hormonal factors using  digit ratio, ΔR-L, or left-hand dominance and larger sample size are warranted.""]",The Gleason score is an important parameter for clinical outcome in prostate cancer patients
48,What is the treatment of choice  for gastric lymphoma?,"['Clinicopathologic information of gastrointestinal (GI) lymphoma in Southeast  Asia is lacking. A retrospective analysis of 120 cases of GI lymphoma in  Thailand diagnosed at Siriraj Hospital based on WHO classification was  performed. All were non-Hodgkin lymphoma (NHL). The peak age was in the sixth  and seventh decades; a slight male preponderance was observed. Sites of  involvement included stomach (49.2%), intestine (46.7%), and multiple sites  (4.2%). There were 104 cases of primary GI lymphoma (86.7%) and 16 cases of  secondary GI lymphoma (13.3%). Presenting GI symptoms were more common in the  former; while superficial lymphadenopathy and fever were more common in the  latter. Mass lesions were observed in both groups (72.1% vs 56.3%). Localized  and advanced diseases were found in 68.3% and 31.7% of primary GI lymphomas,  respectively. The most common type of lymphoma in both groups was diffuse large  B-cell lymphoma. Lymphoepithelial lesions (LEL) were not significantly different  between the two groups (58.2% vs 42.9%), but Helicobacterpylori infection was  significantly associated with primary gastric lymphoma (p < 0.0001). The  treatment of choice for localized primary GI lymphoma is controversial. Complete  surgical resection may increase the chance of complete remission, but mortality  and relapse rates might be higher than those observed with combination  chemotherapy alone. GI lymphomas in Thailand are mostly primary B-cell NHL. LEL  is not indicative of primary GI lymphoma, but H. pylori infection is closely  associated with primary gastric lymphoma. A prospective study to determine the  treatment of choice for localized GI lymphoma is needed.', 'BACKGROUND & AIMS: Appropriate management of primary gastric lymphoma is  controversial. This prospective, multicenter study aimed to evaluate the  accuracy of endoscopic biopsy diagnosis and clinical staging procedures and  assess a treatment strategy based on Helicobacter pylori status and tumor stage  and grade. METHODS: Of 266 patients with primary gastric B-cell lymphoma, 236 with stages  EI (n = 151) or EII (n = 85) were included in an intention-to-treat analysis.  Patients with H. pylori-positive stage EI low-grade lymphoma underwent  eradication therapy. Nonresponders and patients with stage EII low-grade  lymphoma underwent gastric surgery. Depending on the residual tumor status and  predefined risk factors, patients received either radiotherapy or no further  treatment. Patients with high-grade lymphoma underwent surgery and chemotherapy  at stages EI/EII, complemented by radiation in case of incomplete resection. RESULTS: Endoscopic-bioptic typing and grading and clinical staging were  accurate to 73% and 70%, respectively, based on the histopathology of resected  specimens. The overall 2-year survival rates for low-grade lymphoma did not  differ in the risk-adjusted treatment groups, ranging from 89% to 96%. In  high-grade lymphoma, patients with complete resection or microscopic tumor  residuals had significantly better survival rates (88% for EI and 83% for EII)  than those with macroscopic tumor residues (53%; P < 0.001). CONCLUSIONS: There is a considerable need for improvement in clinical diagnostic  and staging procedures, especially with a view toward nonsurgical treatment.  With the exception of eradication therapy in H. pylori-positive low-grade  lymphoma of stage EI and the subgroup of locally advanced high-grade lymphoma,  resection remains the treatment of choice. However, because there is an  increasing trend toward stomach-conserving therapy, a randomized trial comparing  cure of disease and quality of life with surgical and conservative treatment is  needed.', 'The treatment of primary gastric lymphoma is controversial. The role of surgery  has come to be questioned with increasing knowledge about the pathogenesis of  gastric lymphoma and with new therapeutic approaches such as eradication of  Helicobacter pylori. We review published clinical trials of primary gastric  lymphoma, including preliminary results of our own prospective multicenter  trial. The results of 7 trials of H. pylori eradication and 12 prospective  therapeutic trials trial are discussed. On basis of these data it is concluded  that surgery with intention of R0 resection is the treatment of choice in stages  EI2 and EII1 of low-grade lymphoma. In high-grade lymphomas it is still unclear  whether surgery or its primary combination with radio- or chemotherapy should be  preferred. The eradication of H. pylori is a promising therapeutic approach for  localized low-grade mucosa-associated lymphoid tissue lymphoma. A randomized  trial is needed to clarify whether medical or surgical management of localized  gastric lymphoma or a combination of two is the best treatment modality.', 'OBJECTIVE: We began a controlled clinical trial to assess efficacy and toxicity  of surgery (S), surgery + radiotherapy (SRT), surgery + chemotherapy (SCT), and  chemotherapy (CT) in the treatment of primary gastric diffuse large cell  lymphoma in early stages: IE and II1. SUMMARY BACKGROUND DATA: Management of primary gastric lymphoma remains  controversial. No controlled clinical trials have evaluated the different  therapeutic schedules, and prognostic factors have not been identified in a  uniform population. PATIENTS AND METHODS: Five hundred eighty-nine patients were randomized to be  treated with S (148 patients), SR (138 patients), SCT (153 patients), and CT  (150 patients). Radiotherapy was delivered at doses of 40 Gy; chemotherapy was  CHOP (cyclophosphamide, doxorubicin, vincristine, and prednisone) at standard  doses. International Prognostic Index (IPI) and modified IPI (MIPI) were  assessed to determine outcome. RESULTS: Complete response rates were similar in the 4 arms. Actuarial curves at  10 years of event-free survival (EFS) were as follows: S: 28% (95% confidence  interval [CI], 22% to 41%); SRT: 23% (95% CI, 16% to 29%); that were  statistically significant when compared with SCT: 82% (95% CI, 73% to 89%); and  CT: 92% (95% CI, 84% to 99%) (P < 0.001). Actuarial curves at 10 years showed  that overall survivals (OS) were as follows: S: 54% (95% CI, 46% to 64%); SRT:  53% (95% CI, 45% to 68%); that were statistically significant to SCT: 91% (95%  CI, 85% to 99%); CT: 96% (95% CI, 90% to 103%)(P < 0.001). Late toxicity was  more frequent and severe in patients who undergoing surgery. IPI and MIPI were  not useful in determining outcome and multivariate analysis failed to identify  other prognostic factors. CONCLUSION: In patients with primary gastric diffuse large cell lymphoma and  aggressive histology, diffuse large cell lymphoma in early stage SCT achieved  good results, but surgery was associated with some cases of lethal  complications. Thus it appears that CT should be considered the treatment of  choice in this patient setting. Current clinical classifications of risk are not  useful in defining treatment.', ""OBJECTIVE: To present our experience with the treatment of primary  gastrointestinal (GI) non-Hodgkin's lymphoma, evaluate prognostic factors, and  give our recommendations for treatment. DESIGN: Retrospective study. SETTING: Teaching hospital, Spain. SUBJECTS: 76 patients (47 men and 29 women, mean age 51 years) treated over the  15 years 1980-1994. INTERVENTIONS: 52 patients had radical resections, 19 palliative resections, and  5 biopsy alone. 42 (55%) also had adjuvant chemotherapy and 20 (26%)  radiotherapy. RESULTS: Patients with primary intestinal lymphoma were slightly but not  significantly younger than those with gastric lymphoma (43 compared with 56  years). 43 Patients (57%) had tumours in the stomach, 26 (34%) in the small  bowel, and 7 (9%) in the colon. At presentation 34 had stage I disease, 25 stage  IIE1 disease, and the remaining 17 stage IIE2; 14 were classified as low grade,  41 as intermediate, and 21 as high grade. 60 (79%) had a B-cell phenotype.  Overall 5-year survival was 53%. Of the 11 variables tested by univariate  analysis for their prognostic effect only abdominal mass (p < 0.001), clinical  stage (p < 0.001), type of operation (p < 0.001), tumour size (p < 0.05), and  histological grade (p < 0.05) achieved significance, but when Cox's multivariate  analysis was applied only clinical stage was significant (p < 0.01). CONCLUSION: Operation is the treatment of choice, but chemotherapy and  radiotherapy may have a role though as yet there are no standard guidelines for  their use."", 'BACKGROUND: Rilotumumab is a fully human monoclonal antibody that selectively  targets the ligand of the MET receptor, hepatocyte growth factor (HGF). We aimed  to assess the efficacy, safety, and pharmacokinetics of rilotumumab combined  with epirubicin, cisplatin, and capecitabine, and to assess potential  biomarkers, in patients with advanced MET-positive gastric or gastro-oesophageal  junction adenocarcinoma. METHODS: This multicentre, randomised, double-blind, placebo-controlled, phase 3  study was done at 152 centres in 27 countries. We recruited adults (aged ≥18  years) with unresectable locally advanced or metastatic gastric or  gastro-oesophageal junction adenocarcinoma, an Eastern Cooperative Oncology  Group (ECOG) performance status of 0 or 1, MET-positive tumours (≥25% of tumour  cells with membrane staining of ≥1+ staining intensity), and evaluable disease,  who had not received previous systemic therapy. Eligible patients were randomly  assigned (1:1) via a computerised voice response system to receive rilotumumab  15 mg/kg intravenously or placebo in combination with open-label chemotherapy  (epirubicin 50 mg/m2 intravenously; cisplatin 60 mg/m2 intravenously;  capecitabine 625 mg/m2 orally twice daily) in 21-day cycles for up to ten  cycles. After completion of chemotherapy, patients continued to receive  rilotumumab or placebo monotherapy until disease progression, intolerability,  withdrawal of consent, or study termination. Randomisation was stratified by  disease extent and ECOG performance status. Both patients and physicians were  masked to study treatment assignment. The primary endpoint was overall survival,  analysed by intention to treat. We report the final analysis. This study is  registered with ClinicalTrials.gov, number NCT01697072. FINDINGS: Between Nov 7, 2012, and Nov 21, 2014, 609 patients were randomly  assigned to rilotumumab plus epirubicin, cisplatin, and capecitabine  (rilotumumab group; n=304) or placebo plus epirubicin, cisplatin, and  capecitabine (placebo group; n=305). Study treatment was stopped early after an  independent data monitoring committee found a higher number of deaths in the  rilotumumab group than in the placebo group; all patients in the rilotumumab  group subsequently discontinued all study treatment. Median follow-up was 7·7  months (IQR 3·6-12·0) for patients in the rilotumumab group and 9·4 months  (5·3-13·1) for patients in the placebo group. Median overall survival was 8·8  months (95% CI 7·7-10·2) in the rilotumumab group compared with 10·7 months  (9·6-12·4) in the placebo group (stratified hazard ratio 1·34, 95% CI 1·10-1·63;  p=0·003). The most common grade 3 or worse adverse events in the rilotumumab and  placebo groups were neutropenia (86 [29%] of 298 patients vs 97 [32%] of 299  patients), anaemia (37 [12%] vs 43 [14%]), and fatigue (30 [10%] vs 35 [12%]).  The frequency of serious adverse events was similar in the rilotumumab and  placebo groups (142 [48%] vs 149 [50%]). More deaths due to adverse events  occurred in the rilotumumab group than the placebo group (42 [14%] vs 31 [10%]).  In the rilotumumab group, 33 (11%) of 298 patients had fatal adverse events due  to disease progression, and nine (3%) had fatal events not due to disease  progression. In the placebo group, 23 (8%) of 299 patients had fatal adverse  events due to disease progression, and eight (3%) had fatal events not due to  disease progression.

Trifluridine/tipiracil  therapy contributed to effective and safety treatment even in late-line  chemotherapy for recurrent gastric cancer.', ""Fluoropyrimidines form the mainstay in treatment of gastrointestinal  malignancies. For decades 5-fluorouracil (5FU), was the major fluoropyrimidine.  Currently it is usually given in a combination with leucovorin and oxaliplatin,  i.e. FOLFOX, or irinotecan, i.e. FOLFIRI, or all three, i.e. FOLFIRINOX, but  gradually it has been replaced by oral fluoropyrimidine prodrug formulations,  such as tegafur-uracil and S-1 (both contain ftorafur), and capecitabine  (Xeloda®). Novel drugs such as the antivascular endothelial growth factor  antibody, bevacizumab, and the anti-epidermal growth factor receptor antibody,  cetuximab, are often combined with one of these treatment options. However, when  resistance emerged, no alternatives were available. TAS-102, a combination of  trifluorothymidine and the thymidine phosphorylase inhibitor TPI in a 1:0.5  ratio, is a novel oral formulation, which is active in 5FU-resistant models,  both in vitro and in xenograft models. In addition to inhibition of thymidylate  synthase, the major mechanism of action of classical fluoropyrimidines,  TAS-102's major mechanism of action is incorporation into DNA, thereby causing  DNA damage. TAS-102 also follows an alternative activation pathway via thymidine  kinase, and is not a substrate for dihydropyrimidine dehydrogenase. All together  this explains the efficacy in 5FU-resistant models. In early clinical studies,  the twice-daily schedule (5 days on, 2 days rest) for 2 weeks every 4 weeks, led  to a significant disease control rate in various malignancies. This schedule  showed consistent activity in two randomized trials on fluoropyrimidine  refractory colorectal cancer patients, reflected by an increase of 2-3 months in  overall survival in the TAS-102 group compared with placebo. Considering the  impressive preclinical potential of various combinations TAS-102 has the promise  to become an alternative for 5FU-resistant cancer."", 'BACKGROUND: The phase II YO28252 study (NCT01590719) examined first-line  onartuzumab plus mFOLFOX6 in patients with metastatic, human epidermal growth  factor receptor 2-negative adenocarcinoma of the stomach or gastroesophageal  junction. MET immunohistochemistry expression as a biomarker of onartuzumab  activity was also examined. PATIENTS AND METHODS: Patients were randomized 1:1 to receive standard mFOLFOX6  plus onartuzumab (10 mg/kg) or placebo in 2-week cycles for 12 cycles, followed  by onartuzumab or placebo until disease progression. Coprimary endpoints were  progression-free survival (PFS) in intent-to-treat (ITT) and MET-positive  populations. The target hazard ratio (HR) was 0.70 for patients in the ITT group  and 0.60 in the MET-positive population. Secondary endpoints were overall  survival (OS), overall response rate (ORR), and safety. RESULTS: Overall, 123 patients were enrolled (n = 62 onartuzumab, n = 61  placebo). Median PFS was 6.77 versus 6.97 months for onartuzumab versus placebo,  respectively (HR, 1.08; 95% confidence interval [CI], 0.71-1.63; p = .71). In  the MET-positive population, median PFS was 5.95 versus 6.80 months, onartuzumab  versus placebo (HR, 1.38; 95% CI, 0.60-3.20; p = .45). Median OS was 10.61  months for onartuzumab versus 11.27 months for placebo) (HR, 1.06, 0.64-1.75; p  = .83). In the MET-positive population, median OS was 8.51 versus 8.48 months  for onartuzumab versus placebo, respectively (HR, 1.12, 95% CI, 0.45-2.78; p =  .80). ORR was 60.5% for the onartuzumab group and 57.1% for placebo. Grade 3-5  adverse events (AEs) were seen in 88.3% of patients receiving onartuzumab and in  78.3% of patients receiving placebo, with serious AEs in 55% and 40%,  respectively. CONCLUSION: The addition of onartuzumab to mFOLFOX6 in gastric cancer did not  improve efficacy in an unselected population or in a MET  immunohistochemistry-positive population. IMPLICATIONS FOR PRACTICE: The YO28252 study demonstrated that the addition of  the anti-MET agent onartuzumab to mFOLFOX6 for treatment of gastric cancer did  not improve efficacy in an overall study population or those selected for  positive MET status by immunohistochemistry. This highlights the importance of  correctly selecting biomarkers for targeted therapies. A multivariate analysis  suggested that MET positivity may still be prognostic for worse median overall  survival in gastric cancer; therefore, it is important to continue investigation  into the optimal approach to inhibit MET signaling in gastric cancer.', 'BACKGROUND: Trastuzumab deruxtecan (DS-8201a) is a novel HER2-targeted  antibody-drug conjugate with a humanised anti-HER2 antibody, cleavable  peptide-based linker, and topoisomerase I inhibitor payload. A phase 1,  non-randomised, open-label, multiple-dose study was done to assess the safety,  tolerability, and activity of trastuzumab deruxtecan in HER2-expressing advanced  solid tumours. The dose escalation (part 1) has previously been reported and the  recommended doses for expansion of 5·4 mg/kg or 6·4 mg/kg were established. In  this Article, we report the safety and preliminary activity results from this  phase 1 trial in all patients with HER2-positive gastric or gastro-oesophageal  junction cancer who received trastuzumab deruxtecan at the recommended doses for  expansion. METHODS: This was an open-label, dose-escalation and dose-expansion phase 1  trial done at eight hospitals and clinics in the USA and six in Japan. Eligible  patients were at least 18 years old in the USA and at least 20 years old in  Japan and had advanced solid tumours (regardless of HER2 expression in dose  escalation or HER2 expression or mutation in dose expansion). The recommended  doses for expansion of 5·4 mg/kg or 6·4 mg/kg trastuzumab deruxtecan were  administered intravenously to patients once every 3 weeks until withdrawal of  consent, unacceptable toxicity, or progressive disease. In this Article, all  patients with HER2-positive gastric or gastro-oesophageal junction cancer with  previous trastuzumab treatment who received trastuzumab deruxtecan were analysed  together. The primary endpoints of the study were safety and preliminary  activity (proportion of patients who achieved an objective response as assessed  by the investigators). The activity evaluable set included all patients who  received at least one dose of trastuzumab deruxtecan at the recommended doses  for expansion, and for whom both baseline and post-treatment activity data were  available. The safety analysis set included all patients who received at least  one dose of trastuzumab deruxtecan at the recommended doses for expansion.  Enrolment for patients with gastric or gastro-oesophageal junction cancer has  completed. This trial is registered at ClinicalTrials.gov, number NCT02564900,  and ClinicalTrials.jp, number JapicCTI-152978. FINDINGS: Between Aug 28, 2015, and Aug 10, 2018, 44 patients with HER2-positive  gastric or gastro-oesophageal junction cancer received at least one dose of  trastuzumab deruxtecan at the recommended doses for expansion. All patients had  at least one treatment-emergent adverse event. The most frequent grade 3 or  worse treatment-emergent adverse events included anaemia (13 [30%]) and  decreases in neutrophil (nine [20%]), platelet (eight [18%]), and white blood  cell (seven [16%]) counts. Serious treatment-emergent adverse events occurred in  11 (25%) patients. There were four pneumonitis cases (three grade 2 and one  grade 3). There were no drug-related deaths due to treatment-emergent adverse  events. 19 (43·2%; 95% CI 28·3-59·0) of 44 patients had a confirmed objective  response. INTERPRETATION: Trastuzumab deruxtecan had a manageable safety profile and  showed preliminary activity in heavily pretreated patients with HER2-positive  gastric or gastro-oesophageal junction cancer. These results support further  investigation of trastuzumab deruxtecan for HER2-positive gastric or  gastro-oesophageal junction cancer post-trastuzumab.

49,What is herceptin?,"['BACKGROUND: Herceptin is a humanized antibody that binds to the product of the  HER-2 oncogene. Clinical studies have indicated that treatment with Herceptin  may slow disease progression in tumors expressing high levels of the HER-2  antigen. However, the mechanism of this action is not known. METHODS: Four different cell lines were used that had different levels of HER-2  expression. Treated and nontreated cells were analyzed for DNA strand breaks and  cell cycle perturbation using standard flow cytometry methods. RESULTS: In this study we found that cell lines expressing high levels of HER-2,  when treated with Herceptin, exhibited marked increases in DNA strand breaks as  measured by the TUNEL assay, and that these cells also exhibited slowed growth.  BT-474 and SKBR-3 cell lines, both of which express high levels of the HER-2  antigen, had significant increases in labeled nucleotide expression at 3 and 6  day time points following exposure to Herceptin at a concentration of 10  microg/ml. Similar treatment of MCF-7 and MDA-231 cell lines, both of which  express low levels of HER-2, had little effect on the level of labeled  nucleotide expression at either the 3 or 6 day time points. Following 4 days of  Herceptin treatment, BT-474 and SKBR-3 cell lines had significant decreases in  the percentage of cells in the S phase of growth. This effect was not seen in  either the MCF-7 or MDA-231 cell lines. CONCLUSION: Herceptin has a biological effect only on cells that contain high  levels of HER-2. This effect is a decrease in cell proliferation that is  coincident with, and may be caused by an increase frequency of DNA strand  breaks.', 'Gastric cancer remains one of the most malignant human cancers with poor  prognosis. Herceptin is a well-received antibody drug for HER2 positive gastric  cancer. Primary Herceptin resistance and acquired Herceptin resistance retarded  the use of Herceptin for gastric cancer. We herein reported CMIP (C-Maf-inducing  protein) was overexpressed in Herceptin-resistant gastric cancer cells MKN45-HR  and NCI-N87-HR; CMIP promoted Herceptin resistance of HER2 positive gastric  cancer cells. SOX2 was examined to be positively regulated by CMIP and also  promoted Herceptin resistance of HER2 positive gastric cancer cells. SOX2 might  mediate the Herceptin resistance promoting role of CMIP in gastric cancer cells.  Elevated expression of CMIP was associated with poor clinicopathological  features including tumor size, lymph node metastasis and clinical stage in HER2  positive gastric cancer patients. Inhibitors of CMIP could be used as potential  adjuvant therapeutic drugs for HER2 positive gastric cancer.', 'Overexpression of erbB2 in breast tumors is associated with poor prognosis and  is a target of receptor-oriented cancer therapy. Trastuzumab (Herceptin), a  monoclonal antibody against a membrane-proximal epitope in the extracellular  region of erbB2, shows a therapeutic effect against a fraction of  erbB2-amplified breast tumors. Unfortunately, resistance to Herceptin is common,  and its cause is as yet unclear. Here we investigated the properties of erbB2 in  a Herceptin-resistant cell line, JIMT-1, established from a breast cancer  patient showing erbB2 gene amplification and primary resistance to Herceptin.  The expression profile of erbB proteins, Herceptin-induced erbB2  internalization, and down-regulation in JIMT-1 were similar to those in  Herceptin-sensitive lines. However, the mean number of Herceptin Mab binding  sites in JIMT-1 was 1/5 that of the expressed erbB2 molecules, although 5% to  10% of the cells showed a approximately 10-fold higher Herceptin binding than  the main population. Herceptin Fab and Mab 2C4, an antibody binding to an  epitope in the ectodomain further removed from the membrane, bound more  efficiently to JIMT-1 cells than Herceptin Mab, implying that erbB2 was partly  masked. The expression of MUC4, a membrane-associated mucin that according to  reports contributes to the masking of membrane proteins, was higher in JIMT-1  than in Herceptin-sensitive lines, and its level was inversely correlated with  the Herceptin binding capacity of single cells. Knockdown of MUC4 expression by  RNA interference increased the binding of Herceptin. Western blotting showed a  low level of proteolytic processing, shedding, and tyrosine phosphorylation of  erbB2 in JIMT-1. The latter finding may explain its Herceptin-resistant  phenotype characterizing both the low and high Herceptin binding subpopulations.  We conclude that masking of erbB2 in JIMT-1 leads to diminished Herceptin  binding and isolation of erbB2 from its normal interaction and activation  partners.', 'Her2 (erbB2/neu) is overexpressed in 25-30% of human breast cancers. Herceptin  is a recombinant humanized Her2 antibody used to treat breast cancer patients  with Her2 overexpression. Over a 5-month selection process, we isolated clones  of BT474 (BT) human breast carcinoma cells (BT/Her(R)) that were resistant to  Herceptin in vitro. In BT/Her(R) subclones, cell-surface, phosphorylated and  total cellular Her2 protein remained high in the continuous presence of  Herceptin. Likewise, the levels of cell-surface, phosphorylated, and total  cellular Her3 and EGFR were either unchanged or only slightly elevated in  BT/Her(R) subclones relative to BT cells. One BT/Her(R) subclone had  substantially upregulated cell-surface EGFR, but this did not correlate with a  higher relative resistance to Herceptin. In looking at the downstream PI-3K/Akt  signaling pathway, phosphorylated and total Akt levels and Akt kinase activities  were all sustained in BT/Her(R) subclones in the presence of Herceptin, but  significantly downregulated in BT cells exposed to Herceptin. Whereas BT cells  lost sensitivity to the PI-3K inhibitor LY294002 in the presence of Herceptin,  BT/Her(R) subclones were equally sensitive to this agent in the presence and  absence of Herceptin. This suggests that BT/Her(R) subclones acquired a  Herceptin-resistant mechanism of PI-3K signaling. BT/Her(R) subclones were also  sensitive to the EGFR kinase inhibitor AG1478 in the presence of Herceptin, to  the same extent as BT cells. The BT/Her(R) subclones provide new insights into  mechanisms of Herceptin resistance and suggest new treatment strategies in  combination with other inhibitors targeted to signal transduction pathways.', 'Herceptin (trastuzumab), an anti-HER2 monoclonal antibody, is the first  oncogene-targeted therapy to be developed for the treatment of metastatic breast  cancer. The Herceptin clinical trial program has demonstrated that treatment  with Herceptin provides substantial clinical benefits when used either as  monotherapy or in combination with a number of chemotherapeutic agents. Of note,  accurate assessment of HER2 status is essential to ensure that the patients most  likely to benefit from Herceptin are identified: patients with  immunohistochemistry (IHC) 3+ or fluorescence in-situ hybridization  (FISH)-positive disease gain the greatest clinical benefits. In addition,  clinical benefits appear to be greater the earlier Herceptin is used, although  there is currently no direct clinical evidence to indicate whether an initial  strategy of combination therapy is better than monotherapy or vice versa.  Herceptin has been shown to be generally well tolerated. The most severe adverse  events are rare serious infusion-related reactions and cardiotoxicity. These  adverse events can be managed by standard care and patients at risk can often be  identified prior to the initiation of Herceptin treatment. Currently, Herceptin  should be given until disease progression, but there could be benefit in  continuing treatment beyond disease progression.', 'Breast cancer (BCa) is the most common cancer affecting women worldwide.  Overexpression of human epidermal growth factor receptor 2 (HER2) occurs in  ~20-25% of invasive ductal breast carcinomas and is associated with the more  aggressive phenotype. Herceptin, a humanized antibody against HER2, is a  standard therapy in HER2-overexpressing cases. Approximately one-third of  patients relapse despite treatment. Therefore numerous studies have investigated  the molecular mechanisms associated with Herceptin resistance. An interaction  between HER2 signalling and steroid hormone receptor signalling pathways has  been previously investigated, but the effect of this relationship on Herceptin  resistance has never been studied. The present study analysed an impact of the  steroid hormone, progesterone (PG), on Herceptin-dependent cell growth  inhibition. Results indicated that Herceptin-inhibited proliferation of breast  cancer cell lines overexpressing HER2 (BT474 and MCF/HER2) in 3D culture is  abolished by PG. Furthermore, results demonstrated that PG led to the activation  of HER2/HER3-mediated signalling. Moreover, PG treatment induced a shift of  Herceptin-dependent cell cycle arrest in G1 phase towards S and G2 phases with  concomitant upregulation of cyclin-dependent kinase 2 (CDK2) and downregulation  of CDK inhibitor p27Kip1. These results demonstrate for the first time PG  involvement in the failure of Herceptin treatment in vitro. The present  observations suggest that cross-talk between PG- and HRG/HER2-initiated  signalling pathways may lead to the acquisition of resistance to Herceptin in  patients with BCa.', ""Herceptin/Trastuzumab is a humanized IgG1κ light chain antibody used to treat  some forms of breast cancer. A phage-displayed recombinant antibody library was  used to obtain a single chain fragment variable (scFv, designated 2B4) to a  linear synthetic peptide representing Herceptin's heavy chain CDR3. Enzyme  linked immunosorbent assays (ELISAs) and piezoimmunosensor/quartz crystal  microbalance (QCM) assays were used to characterize 2B4-binding activity to both  native and heat denatured Herceptin. The 2B4 scFv specifically bound to heat  denatured Herceptin in a concentration dependent manner over a wide (35-220.5  nM) dynamic range. Herceptin denatures and forms significant amounts of  aggregates when heated. UV-vis characterization confirms that Herceptin forms  aggregates as the temperature used to heat Herceptin increases. QCM affinity  assay shows that binding stoichiometry between 2B4 scFv and Herceptin follows a  1:2 relationship proving that 2B4 scFv binds strongly to the dimers of heat  denatured Herceptin aggregates and exhibits an affinity constant of 7.17 ×  10(13) M(-2). The 2B4-based QCM assay was more sensitive than the corresponding  ELISA. Combining QCM with ELISA can be used to more fully characterize  nonspecific binding events in assays. The potential theoretical and clinical  implications of these results and the advantages of the use of QCM to  characterize human therapeutic antibodies in samples are also discussed."", 'Clinical use of Herceptin (trastuzumab), which is a humanized monoclonal  antibody against HER2, started for patients with HER2-overexpressing breast  cancer. To potentiate the efficacy of the Herceptin therapy, this study focused  on the combination of Herceptin with activated immune lymphocytes. We used  peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) as effector cells and used  HER2-unexpressing K562 cells, HER2-weakly-expressing breast carcinoma cells  (Breast-M), or HER2-strongly-expressing breast carcinoma cells (BT-474) as  target cells. Interleukin-2 (IL-2)-activated PBMCs, IL-2/OKT-3-activated PBMCs  and a streptococcal preparation OK-432-activated PBMCs were generated and used  as effector cells. Cytotoxic activity was determined with 4-hour 51Cr release  assay. Both fresh PBMCs and activated PBMCs exhibited Herceptin-dependent  cytotoxicity. Importantly, Herceptin-dependent cytotoxicity was found even at a  lower effector to target cell ratio (E/T ratio) than that of  Herceptin-independent cytotoxicity. In addition, Herceptin-dependent  cytotoxicity by these activated PBMCs was observed even in  HER2-weakly-expressing Breast-M cells. Since gamma-globulin or anti-CD16  antibody abrogated Herceptin-dependent cytotoxicity, it seems likely that  antibody-dependent cellular cytotoxicity (ADCC) plays an important role in the  Herceptin-dependent cytotoxicity. We present a recurrent breast cancer patient  with malignant pleural effusion, in which HER2-strongly-expressing tumor cells  were present, who was undergoing Herceptin therapy. Cluster formation between  tumor cells and intrapleural mononuclear cells was induced 24 hours after  intravenous injection of Herceptin (4 mg/kg). Mononuclear cells bound  specifically to HER2-strongly-expressing tumor cells but not to other cells,  such as mesothelial cells, suggested a Herceptin-mediated binding like ADCC in  vivo. Taken together, these findings suggest that the combination of Herceptin  with various types of activated lymphocytes may be a new therapeutic strategy,  not only for HER2-strongly-expressing breast cancer but also for  HER2-weakly-expressing cancer.', 'PURPOSE: Herceptin is widely used in treating Her2-overexpressing breast cancer.  However, the application of Herceptin in prostate cancer is still controversial.  Our previous results have indicated the relevance of Her2 in the transition of  the androgen requirement in prostate cancer cells. In this study, the effects of  radioimmunotherapy against Her2 in prostate cancer were investigated. MATERIALS AND METHODS: DU145, an androgen receptor-negative prostate cancer cell  line, was used in vitro and in vivo to evaluate the effects of Herceptin labeled  with a beta emitter, Rhenium-188 (Re-188). Its effects on cell growth, extent of  apoptosis, the bio-distribution of Re-188 labeled Herceptin (Re-H), and protein  levels were determined. RESULTS: Treatments with Re-188 and Re-H reduced the proliferation of DU145  cells in dose- and time-dependent manners compared to the Herceptin-treated  group. Growth inhibition and apoptosis were induced after Re-H treatment; growth  inhibition was more distinct in cells with high Her2/p-Her2 levels. Our in vivo  xenograft studies revealed that Re-H treatment significantly retarded tumor  growth and altered the levels of apoptosis-related proteins. The  bio-distribution of Re-H in mice demonstrated a tissue-specific pattern.  Importantly, the levels of p35 protein, which is related to cancer cell survival  and invasion, dramatically decreased after Re-H treatment. CONCLUSIONS: Our data demonstrate that Re-188-labeled Herceptin effectively  inhibited the growth of DU145 cells compared to the Herceptin- and  Re-188-treated cohorts. This implies that targeting Her2 by both radio- and  immuno- therapy might be a potential strategy for treating patients with  androgen-independent prostate cancer.', 'Overexpression of erbB2 in breast tumors is associated with poor prognosis and  is a target of receptor-oriented cancer therapy.

50,What symptoms characterize the Muenke syndrome?,"['BACKGROUND: Muenke syndrome is a genetically determined craniosynostosis that  involves one or both coronal sutures. In some patients it is associated with  skeletal abnormalities such as thimble-like middle phalanges, coned epiphysis,  and/or neurological impairment, namely sensorineural hearing loss or mental  retardation. In spite of a variable phenotype, Muenke syndrome has been related  to a unique mutation on the FGFR3 gene, Pro 250 to Arg, which is characteristic  of this disease. Because of the incomplete penetrance of this anomaly, the  suspicion of Muenke syndrome must be raised in any child with uni- or bilateral  coronal craniosynostosis, and the genetic analysis propounded even in the  absence of extracranial features. ILLUSTRATIVE CASES: We report the cases of two sisters who presented with Muenke  syndrome and whose affected mother did not have any form of craniosynostosis.', 'Muenke syndrome is characterized by various craniofacial deformities and is  caused by an autosomal-dominant activating mutation in fibroblast growth factor  receptor 3 (FGFR3(P250R) ). Here, using mice carrying a corresponding mutation  (FgfR3(P244R) ), we determined whether the mutation affects temporomandibular  joint (TMJ) development and growth. In situ hybridization showed that FgfR3 was  expressed in condylar chondroprogenitors and maturing chondrocytes that also  expressed the Indian hedgehog (Ihh) receptor and transcriptional target Patched  1(Ptch1). In FgfR3(P244R) mutants, the condyles displayed reduced levels of Ihh  expression, H4C-positive proliferating chondroprogenitors, and collagen type II-  and type X-expressing chondrocytes. Primary bone spongiosa formation was also  disturbed and was accompanied by increased osteoclastic activity and reduced  trabecular bone formation. Treatment of wild-type condylar explants with  recombinant FGF2/FGF9 decreased Ptch1 and PTHrP expression in  superficial/polymorphic layers and proliferation in chondroprogenitors. We also  observed early degenerative changes of condylar articular cartilage, abnormal  development of the articular eminence/glenoid fossa in the TMJ, and fusion of  the articular disc. Analysis of our data indicates that the activating  FgfR3(P244R) mutation disturbs TMJ developmental processes, likely by reducing  hedgehog signaling and endochondral ossification. We suggest that a balance  between FGF and hedgehog signaling pathways is critical for the integrity of TMJ  development and for the maintenance of cellular organization.', 'Muenke syndrome caused by the FGFR3 Pro250Arg mutation is associated with  craniosynostosis, hearing loss, and various bony anomalies. Although this  mutation is involved in bone growth and development, bony tumors are rare in  this condition. We describe a patient with a molecular diagnosis of Muenke  syndrome who also presented with multiple osteochondromas of the upper and lower  extremities. This association has only been described once before in a patient  with an isolated osteochondroma of the proximal tibia. Altered expression of  FGFR3, an important mediator of chondrocyte proliferation and differentiation  during in the growth plates of long bones, may help to explain the development  of osteochondromatous lesions in this patient.', ""The Muenke syndrome (MS) is characterized by unicoronal or bicoronal  craniosynostosis, midfacial hypoplasia, ocular hypertelorism, and a variety of  minor abnormalities associated with a mutation in the fibroblast growth factor  receptor 3 (FGFR3) gene. The birth prevalence is approximately one in 10,000  live births, accounting for 8-10% of patients with coronal synostosis. Although  MS is a relatively common diagnosis in patients with craniosynostosis syndromes,  with autosomal dominant inheritance, there has been no report of MS, in an  affected Korean family with typical cephalo-facial morphology that has been  confirmed by molecular studies. Here, we report a familial case of MS in a  female patient with a Pro250Arg mutation in exon 7 (IgII-IGIII linker domain) of  the FGFR3 gene. This patient had mild midfacial hypoplasia, hypertelorism,  downslanting palpebral fissures, a beak shaped nose, plagio-brachycephaly, and  mild neurodevelopmental delay. The same mutation was confirmed in the patient's  mother, two of the mother's sisters and the maternal grandfather.

To better understand the pathophysiology of  the Muenke syndrome, we present collective findings from several recent studies  that have characterized a genetically equivalent mouse model for Muenke syndrome  (FgfR3 (P244R)) and compare them with human phenotypes. CONCLUSIONS: FgfR3 (P244R) mutant mice show premature fusion of facial sutures,  premaxillary and/or zygomatic sutures, but rarely the coronal suture. The mice  also lack the typical limb phenotype. On the other hand, the mutant mice display  maxillary retrusion in association with a shortening of the anterior cranial  base and a premature closure of intersphenoidal and spheno-occipital  synchondroses, resembling human midface hypoplasia. In addition, sensorineural  hearing loss is detected in all FgfR3 (P244R) mutant mice as in the majority of  Muenke syndrome patients. It is caused by a defect in the mechanism of cell fate  determination in the organ of Corti. The mice also express phenotypes that have  not been previously described in humans, such as reduced cortical bone  thickness, hypoplastic trabecular bone, and defective temporomandibular joint  structure. Therefore, the FgfR3 (P244R) mouse provides an excellent opportunity  to study disease mechanisms of some classical phenotypes of Muenke syndrome and  to test novel therapeutic strategies. The mouse model can also be further  explored to discover previously unreported yet potentially significant  phenotypes of Muenke syndrome.', 'Muenke syndrome caused by the FGFR3 Pro250Arg mutation is associated with  craniosynostosis, hearing loss, and various bony anomalies. Although this  mutation is involved in bone growth and development, bony tumors are rare in  this condition. We describe a patient with a molecular diagnosis of Muenke  syndrome who also presented with multiple osteochondromas of the upper and lower  extremities. This association has only been described once before in a patient  with an isolated osteochondroma of the proximal tibia. Altered expression of  FGFR3, an important mediator of chondrocyte proliferation and differentiation  during in the growth plates of long bones, may help to explain the development  of osteochondromatous lesions in this patient.', 'PURPOSE: The Muenke syndrome mutation (FGFR3 (P250R)), which was discovered 15  years ago, represents the single most common craniosynostosis mutation.

FGFR3 is known to play a role in controlling nervous system  development. We describe the clinical and neuroradiological findings of the  first two patients, to our knowledge, affected by HCH and MS, respectively, in  whom bilateral dysgenesis of the medial temporal lobe structures has been  observed. In both patients diagnosis was confirmed by molecular analysis. They  were mentally normal and showed similarities in early-onset temporal  lobe-related seizures. In both patients EEG recorded bilateral temporal region  discharges. MRI detected temporal lobe anomalies with inadequate differentiation  between white and gray matter, defective gyri, and abnormally shaped  hippocampus.', 'OBJECTIVE: To investigate executive function and adaptive behavior in  individuals with Muenke syndrome using validated instruments with a normative  population and unaffected siblings as controls. STUDY DESIGN: Participants in this cross-sectional study included individuals  with Muenke syndrome (P250R mutation in FGFR3) and their mutation-negative  siblings. Participants completed validated assessments of executive functioning  (Behavior Rating Inventory of Executive Function [BRIEF]) and adaptive behavior  skills (Adaptive Behavior Assessment System, Second Edition [ABAS-II]). RESULTS: Forty-four with a positive FGFR3 mutation, median age 9 years, range 7  months to 52 years were enrolled. In addition, 10 unaffected siblings served as  controls (5 males, 5 females; median age, 13 years; range, 3-18 years). For the  General Executive Composite scale of the BRIEF, 32.1% of the cohort had scores  greater than +1.5 SD, signifying potential clinical significance. For the  General Adaptive Composite of the ABAS-II, 28.2% of affected individuals scored  in the 3rd-8th percentile of the normative population, and 56.4% were below the  average category (<25th percentile). Multiple regression analysis did not  identify craniosynostosis as a predictor of BRIEF (P = .70) or ABAS-II scores (P  = .70). In the sibling pair analysis, affected siblings performed significantly  poorer on the BRIEF General Executive Composite and the ABAS-II General Adaptive  Composite. CONCLUSION: Individuals with Muenke syndrome are at an increased risk for  developing adaptive and executive function behavioral changes compared with a  normative population and unaffected siblings.', 'In about 30% of the patients with syndromal craniosynostosis, a genetic mutation  can be traced. For the purpose of adequate genetic counseling and treatment of  these patients, the full spectrum of clinical findings for each specific  mutation needs to be appreciated. The Pro250Arg mutation in the FGFR3 gene is  found in patients with Muenke syndrome and is one of the most frequently  encountered mutations in craniosynostosis syndromes. A number of studies on the  relationship between genotype and phenotype concerning this specific mutation  have been published. Two Dutch families with Muenke syndrome were screened for  the reported characteristics of this syndrome and for additional features. New  phenotypical findings were hypoplasia of the frontal sinus, ptosis of the upper  eyelids, dysplastic elbow joints with restricted elbow motion, and mild  cutaneous syndactyly. Incidentally, polydactyly, severe ankylosis of the elbow,  fusion of cervical vertebrae, and epilepsy were found. Upper eyelid ptosis is  thought to be pathognomonic for Saethre-Chotzen syndrome but was also observed  in our series of patients with Muenke syndrome. Because Muenke and  Saethre-Chotzen syndrome can have similar phenotypes, DNA analysis is needed to  distinguish between these syndromes, even when a syndrome diagnosis is already  made in a family member.']","Muenke syndrome is an autosomal dominant disorder characterized by coronal suture craniosynostosis, hearing loss, developmental delay, carpal and tarsal fusions, and the presence of the Pro250Arg mutation in the FGFR3 gene.   Muenke syndrome is characterized by coronal craniosynostosis (bilateral more often than unilateral), hearing loss, developmental delay, and carpal and/or tarsal bone coalition. Tarsal coalition is a distinct feature of Muenke syndrome and has been reported since the initial description of the disorder in the 1990s.   "
51,Which is the most widely used model for the study of multiple sclerosis (MS)?,"['In multiple sclerosis (MS) the structural damage to axons determines the  persistent clinical deficit patients acquire during the course of the disease.  It is therefore important to test therapeutic strategies that can prevent or  reverse this structural damage. The conventional animal model of MS,  experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis (EAE), typically shows disseminated  inflammation in the central nervous system, which leads to a clinical deficit  that cannot be directly attributed to a defined tract system. For this reason we  have developed a localized EAE model, in which large inflammatory lesions are  targeted to the dorsal columns of the spinal cord, an area including the  corticospinal tract. These lesions show the pathological hallmarks of MS plaques  and lead to reproducible and pronounced deficits in hindlimb locomotion. Because  of the anatomical specificity of this technique we can now use highly sensitive  behavioral tests that assess the functional integrity of specific axonal tracts.  We show that these tests are predictive of the site and extent of a given lesion  and are more sensitive for assessing the clinical course than the scales  commonly used for disseminated EAE models. We believe that this targeted EAE  model will become a helpful new tool for the evaluation of therapeutic  approaches for MS that attempt to protect axons or support their repair.', 'Experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis (EAE) is an animal model for studying  multiple sclerosis (MS). Calpain has been implicated in many inflammatory and  neurodegenerative events that lead to disability in EAE and MS. Thus, treating  EAE animals with calpain inhibitors may block these events and ameliorate  disability. To test this hypothesis, acute EAE Lewis rats were treated dose  dependently with the calpain inhibitor calpeptin (50-250 microg/kg). Calpain  activity, gliosis, loss of myelin, and axonal damage were attenuated by  calpeptin therapy, leading to improved clinical scores. Neuronal and  oligodendrocyte death were also decreased, with down-regulation of proapoptotic  proteins, suggesting that decreases in cell death were due to decreases in the  expression or activity of proapoptotic proteins. These results indicate that  calpain inhibition may offer a novel therapeutic avenue for treating EAE and MS.', 'To assess neurological impairments quantitatively in an animal model of multiple  sclerosis (MS), we have used a targeted model of experimental autoimmune  encephalomyelitis (EAE), which leads to the formation of anatomically defined  lesions in the spinal cord. Deficits in the hindlimb locomotion are therefore  well defined and highly reproducible, in contrast to the situation in  generalized EAE with disseminated lesions. Behavioral tests for hindlimb  sensorimotor functions, originally established for traumatic spinal cord injury,  revealed temporary or persistent deficits in open field locomotion, the grid  walk, the narrow beam and the measurement of the foot exorotation angle. Such  refined behavioral testing in EAE will be crucial for the analysis of new  therapeutic approaches for MS that seek to improve or prevent neurological  impairment.', ""The pathogenic events in multiple sclerosis (MS) that result in immune cell  infiltration, multifocal demyelination and axonal loss have been focused by the  strong impact of the classical MS model experimental autoimmune  encephalomyelitis (EAE) towards the hypothesis that MS is an entirely T  cell-mediated disease. Although conspicuous humoral immune responses have been  known since Kabal's seminal finding of elevated immunoglobulins (Igs) in the  cerebrospinal fluid (CSF), only in the past few years evidence derived from  recent studies of the MS lesion of anti-myelin antibodies (Abs) in patients with  early MS and of MS animal models has led to a renewed interest in the role for B  cells, plasma cells and their products in the pathogenesis of MS. This review  surveys the actual data concerning the role of the humoral immune system in MS  and EAE and explains potential modes of action and long-time persistence in the  inflamed brain tissue as a B cell-supportive microenvironment in MS. These  mechanisms include the modulation of antigen presentation and costimulation to T  cells, increased myelin opsonisation und recruitment of inflammatory cells to  the CNS, but also immunoregulatory influences on the remyelination by  anti-myelin B cells and Abs. So, affecting the humoral immune system in MS would  be a reasonable therapeutic option."", 'Multiple sclerosis is a chronic inflammatory demyelinating disease, associated,  in 50-80% of patients, with persistent pain. While the type of pain that affects  these patients is being more documented, the mechanisms underlying this  pathology are still poorly understood and animal models of such chronic pain  associated with MS are required. The aim of our study was to characterize the  sensory abnormalities and in particular the clinical signs linked to persistent  pain in two models of Experimental Autoimmune Encephalomyelitis (EAE) in the  rat. This behavioural characterization tested several sensory modalities such as  mechanical and thermal (heat/cold) hyperalgesia or allodynia and explored some  of these modalities on two different extremities: the hindpaws and the tail. Our  study showed that while one of the model produced more robust motor impairment,  animals of both models suffer from mechanical hyperalgesia and thermal allodynia  to cold, both at the level of the tail and the hindpaws. While the time-course  changes of some of these modalities are shifted in the time between the two  models, they represent good models of the sensory abnormalities experienced by  MS patients. The second part of our study aimed at characterizing from a  pharmacological point of view the most robust model (""EAE+Cyclosporine"") and  showed that Gabapentin, Duloxetine and Tramadol partially relieved some of the  clinical signs. Our results suggest that the model ""EAE+Cyclosporine"" in the rat  is a good model of chronic sensory abnormalities observed in MS patients both  from a behavioural and pharmacological point of view.', 'Several single-nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) genome-wide association studies  (GWASs) have been completed in multiple sclerosis (MS). Follow-up studies of the  variants with the most promising rankings, especially when supplemented by  informed candidate gene selection, have proven to be extremely successful. In  this study we report the results of a multi-stage replication analysis of the  putatively associated SNPs identified in the Wellcome Trust Case Control  Consortium non-synonymous SNP (nsSNP) screen. In total, the replication sample  consisted of 3444 patients and 2595 controls. A combined analysis of the nsSNP  screen and replication data provides evidence implicating a novel additional  locus, rs3748816 in membrane metalloendopeptidase-like 1 (MMEL1; odds  ratio=1.16, P=3.54 × 10⁻⁶) in MS susceptibility.', 'We hypothesized that quantitative MS/MS-based proteomics at multiple time  points, incorporating rapid microwave and magnetic (M(2) ) sample preparation,  could enable relative protein expression to be correlated to disease progression  in the experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis (EAE) animal model of multiple  sclerosis. To test our hypothesis, microwave-assisted  reduction/alkylation/digestion of proteins from brain tissue lysates bound to C8  magnetic beads and microwave-assisted isobaric chemical labeling were performed  of released peptides, in 90 s prior to unbiased proteomic analysis. Disease  progression in EAE was assessed by scoring clinical EAE disease severity and  confirmed by histopathologic evaluation for central nervous system inflammation.  Decoding the expression of 283 top-ranked proteins (p <0.05) at each time point  relative to their expression at the peak of disease, from a total of 1191  proteins observed in four technical replicates, revealed a strong statistical  correlation to EAE disease score, particularly for the following four proteins  that closely mirror disease progression: 14-3-3ε (p = 3.4E-6); GPI (p = 2.1E-5);  PLP1 (p = 8.0E-4); PRX1 (p = 1.7E-4). These results were confirmed by Western  blotting, signaling pathway analysis, and hierarchical clustering of EAE risk  groups. While validation in a larger cohort is underway, we conclude that M(2)  proteomics is a rapid method to quantify putative prognostic/predictive protein  biomarkers and therapeutic targets of disease progression in the EAE animal  model of multiple sclerosis.', 'Recent years have substantially broadened our view on the pathogenesis of  multiple sclerosis (MS). While earlier concepts focused predominantly on T  lymphocytes as the key cell type to mediate inflammatory damage within central  nervous system (CNS) lesions, emerging evidence suggests that B lymphocytes may  play a comparably important role both as precursors of antibody-secreting plasma  cells and as antigen-presenting cells (APCs) for the activation of T cells. With  greater appreciation of this pathogenic B-cell function in MS, B-cell-directed  therapies, and in particular B-cell-depleting monoclonal antibodies targeting  the CD20 molecule, have gained enormous interest over recent years. Clinical  trials demonstrated that anti-CD20 treatment, which depletes immature and mature  B cells but spares CD20 negative plasma cells, rapidly reduces formation of new  inflammatory CNS lesions. While these findings clearly corroborate a pathogenic  contribution of B cells, recent experimental but also clinical findings indicate  that not all B cells contribute in an equally pathogenic manner and that certain  subsets may in contrast mediate anti-inflammatory effects. In this review, we  summarize current findings in support of pathogenic B-cell function in MS,  including the encouraging clinical data which derived from anti-CD20 MS trials.  Further, we review novel findings suggestive of regulatory properties of B-cell  subsets which may be collaterally abolished by pan-CD20 depletion. In  conclusion, we aim to provide an outlook on how this currently differentiating  concept of pro- and anti-inflammatory B-cell function could be harnessed to  further improve safety and effectiveness of B-cell-directed therapeutic  approaches in MS.', 'Multiple sclerosis (MS) is believed to be initiated when myelin-specific T cells  infiltrate the central nervous system (CNS), triggering subsequent recruitment  of inflammatory leukocytes to the CNS. The contribution of neutrophils to CNS  autoimmune disease has been underappreciated, but several studies in  experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis (EAE), an animal model of MS, indicate  that neutrophils have an important role in inflammation. Neutrophils are  hypothesized to contribute to the pathogenesis of EAE by producing cytokines and  promoting breakdown of the blood brain barrier. Neutrophils may also influence  the manifestation of EAE by facilitating parenchymal brain inflammation. This  review summarizes evidence supporting a functional role for neutrophils in EAE  and MS, highlighting the differential regulation of neutrophil recruitment in  the brain and spinal cord.', 'Magnetic resonance is the most sensitive para-clinical method available for the  diagnosis of multiple sclerosis since it shows changes in 95% of the patients  with clinically definite multiple sclerosis. However, little correlation has  been found, in different studies, between the parameters of magnetic resonance  and the degree of neurological disability. The development and gradual  application of new techniques of magnetic resonance, which permit specific  detection of the lesions with the greatest degree of nerve dysfunction, permits  improvement in the use of this technique for study of the natural history of the  disease and thus to monitor patients given new treatments.']","Experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis (EAE) is a classical, conventional and widely recognized animal model for studying multiple sclerosis (MS). EAE is the best available model for the inflammatory processes that occur in MS, and for the disease process. A less commonly used model is that of Theiler's murine encephalomyelitis virus (TMEV)."
52,How does ranolazine affect calcium handling in the heart,"['BACKGROUND: Ranolazine (Ran) is known to inhibit multiple targets, including the  late Na(+)current, the rapid delayed rectifying K(+)current, the L-type  Ca(2+)current, and fatty acid metabolism. Functionally, Ran suppresses early  afterdepolarization (EADs) and torsades de pointes (TdP) in drug-induced long QT  type 2 (LQT2) presumably by decreasing intracellular [Na(+)](i) and  Ca(2+)overload. However, simulations of EADs in LQT2 failed to predict their  suppression by Ran. OBJECTIVE: To elucidate the mechanism(s) whereby Ran alters cardiac action  potentials (APs) and cytosolic Ca(2+)transients and suppresses EADs and TdP in  LQT2. METHODS: The known effects of Ran were included in simulations (Shannon and  Mahajan models) of rabbit ventricular APs and Ca(2+)transients in control and  LQT2 models and compared with experimental optical mapping data from Langendorff  rabbit hearts treated with E4031 (0.5 μM) to block the rapid delayed rectifying  K(+)current. Direct effects of Ran on cardiac ryanodine receptors (RyR2) were  investigated in single channels and changes in Ca(2+)-dependent high-affinity  ryanodine binding. RESULTS: Ran (10 μM) alone prolonged action potential durations (206 ± 4.6 to  240 ± 7.8 ms; P <0.05); E4031 prolonged action potential durations (204 ± 6 to  546 ± 35 ms; P <0.05) and elicited EADs and TdP that were suppressed by Ran (10  μM; n = 7 of 7 hearts). Simulations (Shannon but not Mahajan model) closely  reproduced experimental data except for EAD suppression by Ran. Ran reduced open  probability (P(o)) of RyR2 (half maximal inhibitory concentration = 10 ± 3 μM; n  = 7) in bilayers and shifted half maximal effective concentration for  Ca(2+)-dependent ryanodine binding from 0.42 ± 0.02 to 0.64 ± 0.02 μM with 30 μM  Ran. CONCLUSIONS: Ran reduces P(o) of RyR2, desensitizes Ca(2+)-dependent RyR2  activation, and inhibits Ca(i) oscillations, which represents a novel mechanism  for its suppression of EADs and TdP.', 'PURPOSE: Ranolazine is a novel antianginal medication that acts by ameliorating  disturbed sodium and calcium homeostasis. By preventing myocyte sodium and  calcium overload, ranolazine also have potential beneficial effects on  myocardial function. Experimental models support this concept, as do 2 small  studies in human participants receiving ranolazine intravenously. We evaluated  changes in parameters of left ventricular function in stable angina patients  treated with oral ranolazine. METHODS: Twenty-two participants were enrolled with Doppler echocardiography  performed at baseline and a mean of 2 months after initiation of treatment. RESULTS: Global left ventricular function, as assessed by the myocardial  performance index, was significantly improved on drug therapy (P < .0001). This  was due to improvement in both diastolic and systolic parameters. Of 21  patients, 17 reported less angina and 8 patients reported an increase in  activity level. CONCLUSIONS: We report improved parameters of left ventricular function in  response to ranolazine as used in the clinical setting.', 'Pathological conditions, including ischemia and heart failure, are associated  with altered sodium channel function and increased late sodium current  (I(Na,L)), leading to prolonged action potential duration, increased  intracellular sodium and calcium concentrations, and arrhythmias. We used  anemone toxin (ATX)-II to study the effects of increasing I(Na,L) on  intracellular calcium cycling in rat isolated hearts. Cardiac contraction was  abolished using paralytic agents. Ranolazine (RAN) was used to inhibit late  I(Na). Hearts were loaded with fluo-4-acetoxymethyl ester, and myocyte  intracellular calcium transients (CaTs) were measured using laser scanning  confocal microscopy. ATX (1 nM) prolonged CaT duration at 50% recovery in hearts  paced at a basal rate of 2 Hz and increased the sensitivity of the heart to the  development of calcium alternans caused by fast pacing. ATX increased the time  required for recovery of CaT amplitude following a previous beat, and ATX  induced spontaneous calcium release waves during rapid pacing of the heart. ATX  prolonged the duration of repolarization from the initiation of the activation  to terminal repolarization in the pseudo-electrocardiogram. All actions of ATX  were both reversed and prevented by subsequent or prior exposure, respectively,  of hearts to RAN (10 microM). Most importantly, the increased vulnerability of  the heart to the development of calcium alternans during rapid pacing was  reversed or prevented by 10 microM RAN. These results suggest that enhancement  of I(Na,L) alters calcium cycling. Reduction by RAN of I(Na,L)-induced  dysregulation of calcium cycling could contribute to the antiarrhythmic actions  of this agent in both reentrant and triggered arrhythmias.', 'BACKGROUND: Despite advances in antithrombotic therapies and invasive  technology, the risk of recurrent ischemic complications in patients with  non-ST-elevation acute coronary syndromes (NSTE-ACSs) remains substantial.  Ranolazine is a novel agent that inhibits the late sodium current thereby  reducing cellular sodium and calcium overload and has been shown to reduce  ischemia in patients with chronic stable angina. STUDY DESIGN: MERLIN-TIMI 36 is a phase III, randomized, double-blind,  parallel-group, placebo-controlled, multinational clinical trial to evaluate the  efficacy and safety of ranolazine during long-term treatment of patients with  NSTE-ACS receiving standard therapy (N = 6500). Eligible patients are randomized  1:1 to ranolazine or matched placebo, initiated as 200 mg intravenously over 1  hour, followed by an 80-mg/h infusion (40 mg/h for patients with severe renal  insufficiency) for up to 96 hours and oral ranolazine ER 1000 mg BID or matched  placebo until the end of study. The primary end point is the time to first  occurrence of any element of the composite of cardiovascular death, myocardial  infarction, or recurrent ischemia. Secondary end points include ischemia on  Holter monitoring, hospitalization for new or worsening heart failure, quality  of life measures, and exercise performance. The evaluation of long-term safety  will include death from any cause and symptomatic documented arrhythmia.  Recruitment began in October 2004. The trial will continue until 730 major  cardiovascular events and 310 deaths are recorded with expected completion in 24  to 28 months. CONCLUSIONS: MERLIN-TIMI 36 will evaluate the role of ranolazine in the acute  and chronic management of patients presenting with NSTE-ACS.', 'The goal of this study was to test the hypothesis that the novel anti-ischemic  drug ranolazine, which is known to inhibit late I(Na), could reduce  intracellular [Na(+)](i) and diastolic [Ca(2+)](i) overload and improve  diastolic function. Contractile dysfunction in human heart failure (HF) is  associated with increased [Na(+)](i) and elevated diastolic [Ca(2+)](i).  Increased Na(+) influx through voltage-gated Na(+) channels (late I(Na)) has  been suggested to contribute to elevated [Na(+)](i) in HF. In isometrically  contracting ventricular muscle strips from end-stage failing human hearts,  ranolazine (10 micromol/L) did not exert negative inotropic effects on twitch  force amplitude. However, ranolazine significantly reduced frequency-dependent  increase in diastolic tension (i.e., diastolic dysfunction) by approximately 30%  without significantly affecting sarcoplasmic reticulum (SR) Ca(2+) loading. To  investigate the mechanism of action of this beneficial effect of ranolazine on  diastolic tension, Anemonia sulcata toxin II (ATX-II, 40 nmol/L) was used to  increase intracellular Na(+) loading in ventricular rabbit myocytes. ATX-II  caused a significant rise in [Na(+)](i) typically seen in heart failure via  increased late I(Na). In parallel, ATX-II significantly increased diastolic  [Ca(2+)](i). In the presence of ranolazine the increases in late I(Na), as well  as [Na(+)](i) and diastolic [Ca(2+)](i) were significantly blunted at all  stimulation rates without significantly decreasing Ca(2+) transient amplitudes  or SR Ca(2+) content. In summary, ranolazine reduced the frequency-dependent  increase in diastolic tension without having negative inotropic effects on  contractility of muscles from end-stage failing human hearts. Moreover, in  rabbit myocytes the increases in late I(Na), [Na(+)](i) and [Ca(2+)](i) caused  by ATX-II, were significantly blunted by ranolazine. These results suggest that  ranolazine may be of therapeutic benefit in conditions of diastolic dysfunction  due to elevated [Na(+)](i) and diastolic [Ca(2+)](i).', 'Pathological conditions linked to imbalances in oxygen supply and demand (for  example, ischaemia, hypoxia and heart failure) are associated with disruptions  in intracellular sodium ([Na(+)](i)) and calcium ([Ca(2+)](i)) concentration  homeostasis of myocardial cells. A decreased efflux or increased influx of  sodium may cause cellular sodium overload. Sodium overload is followed by an  increased influx of calcium through sodium-calcium exchange. Failure to maintain  the homeostasis of [Na(+)](i) and [Ca(2+)](i) leads to electrical instability  (arrhythmias), mechanical dysfunction (reduced contractility and increased  diastolic tension) and mitochondrial dysfunction. These events increase ATP  hydrolysis and decrease ATP formation and, if left uncorrected, they cause cell  injury and death. The relative contributions of various pathways (sodium  channels, exchangers and transporters) to the rise in [Na(+)](i) remain a matter  of debate. Nevertheless, both the sodium-hydrogen exchanger and abnormal sodium  channel conductance (that is, increased late sodium current (I(Na))) are likely  to contribute to the rise in [Na(+)](i). The focus of this review is on the role  of the late (sustained/persistent) I(Na) in the ionic disturbances associated  with ischaemia/hypoxia and heart failure, the consequences of these ionic  disturbances, and the cardioprotective effects of the antianginal and  anti-ischaemic drug ranolazine. Ranolazine selectively inhibits late I(Na),  reduces [Na(+)](i)-dependent calcium overload and attenuates the abnormalities  of ventricular repolarisation and contractility that are associated with  ischaemia/reperfusion and heart failure. Thus, inhibition of late I(Na) can  reduce [Na(+)](i)-dependent calcium overload and its detrimental effects on  myocardial function.', 'The effective treatment of coronary artery disease targets two distinct goals,  controlling symptomatic angina and decreasing the adverse events associated with  ischemia. Traditional anti-anginal and anti-ischemic drugs function by altering  the determinants of myocardial oxygen supply or demand, usually by altering  loading conditions, changing the heart rate, or impacting contractility.  Blockade of the late inward sodium current, late I(Na), offers another target  for the treatment of ischemia. Blockade of late I(Na) reduces the sodium and  calcium overload that follows ischemia. This improves myocardial relaxation and  reduces left ventricular diastolic stiffness, in turn enhancing myocardial  contractility and perfusion. Ranolazine, a late I(Na) inhibitor, has been shown  to provide both anti-anginal and anti-ischemic benefits without significant  alterations in the heart rate and blood pressure in patients with stable  coronary artery disease. When evaluated in patients with acute coronary  syndrome, ranolazine has been shown to decrease recurrent ischemia, but not  significantly reduce the risk of death or myocardial infarction. This review  will address the rationale that inhibition of the late sodium current is  beneficial in reducing cardiac dysfunction during ischemia, and discuss the  clinical studies supporting the use of ranolazine for its anti-anginal and  anti-ischemic effects.', 'BACKGROUND: Ranolazine (Ran), an antianginal agent, inhibits late Na(+) current.  The purpose of this study was to determine whether there was an added benefit of  adding Ran to cardioplegia (CP) in a model of global ischemia/reperfusion. METHODS AND RESULTS: Isolated rat hearts were Langendorff-perfused and exposed  to 40-minute normothermic, cardioplegic global ischemia and 30 minutes of  reperfusion. Before ischemia and during reperfusion, hearts were treated with no  drug (control) or with the late Na(+) current inhibitors Ran (5 micromol/L) or  tetrodotoxin (1 micromol/L). Ischemic cardioplegic arrest led to an increase of  left ventricular end-diastolic pressure (LVEDP) by > or =20 mm Hg (ie, cardiac  contracture). Ten out of 11 hearts treated with CP alone developed contracture,  whereas 6 out of 11 hearts treated with CP plus Ran developed contracture. Ran  added to CP reduced LVEDP at the end of ischemia from 41+/-5 mm Hg in CP alone  to 26+/-3 mm Hg in CP plus Ran (P=0.024). Area under the curve for LVEDP during  the entire ischemic period was also smaller in CP plus Ran versus CP alone. The  percent increase (from baseline) of LVEDP measured at the end of 30-minute  reperfusion was smaller for CP plus Ran (66+/-18%) versus CP alone (287+/-90%;  P=0.035). The area under the curve for LVEDP during reperfusion was smaller in  CP plus Ran versus CP alone. Tetrodotoxin (1 micromol/L) also reduced cardiac  contracture during ischemia/reperfusion, compared to CP alone. CONCLUSIONS: Our results suggest that Ran may have therapeutic potential as an  adjunct to CP and further support a protective role of Na(+) current inhibition  during ischemia/reperfusion.', 'BACKGROUND: Timothy syndrome is a multisystem disorder associated with QT  interval prolongation and ventricular cardiac arrhythmias. The syndrome has been  linked to mutations in Ca(V)1.2 resulting in gain of function of the L-type  calcium current (I(Ca,L)). Ranolazine is an antianginal agent shown to exert an  antiarrhythmic effect in experimental models of long QT syndrome. OBJECTIVE: The purpose of this study was to develop and characterize an  experimental model of Timothy syndrome by using BayK8644 to mimic the gain of  function of I(Ca,L) and to examine the effects of ranolazine. METHODS: Action potentials from epicardial and M regions and a  pseudo-electrocardiogram (ECG) were simultaneously recorded from  coronary-perfused left ventricular wedge preparations, before and after addition  of BayK8644 (1 microM). RESULTS: BayK8644 preferentially prolonged action potential duration of the M  cell, leading to prolongation of the QT interval and an increase in transmural  dispersion of repolarization (from 44.3 +/- 7 ms to 86.5 +/- 25 ms). Stimulation  at cycle lengths of 250-500 ms led to ST-T wave alternans due to alternation of  the plateau voltage of the M cell action potential as well as development of  delayed afterdepolarizations in epicardial and M cell action potentials.  Ventricular extrasystoles and tachycardia (monomorphic, bidirectional, or  torsades de pointes) developed spontaneously or after rapid pacing. Peak and  late I(Na) were unaffected by BayK8644. Clinically relevant concentrations of  ranolazine (10 microM) suppressed all actions of BayK8644. CONCLUSION: A left ventricular wedge model of long QT syndrome created by  augmentation of I(Ca,L) recapitulates the ECG and arrhythmic manifestations of  Timothy syndrome, which can be suppressed by ranolazine.', 'BACKGROUND: Despite advances in antithrombotic therapies and invasive  technology, the risk of recurrent ischemic complications in patients with  non-ST-elevation acute coronary syndromes (NSTE-ACSs) remains substantial.  Ranolazine is a novel agent that inhibits the late sodium current thereby  reducing cellular sodium and calcium overload and has been shown to reduce  ischemia in patients with chronic stable angina. STUDY DESIGN: MERLIN-TIMI 36 is a phase III, randomized, double-blind,  parallel-group, placebo-controlled, multinational clinical trial to evaluate the  efficacy and safety of ranolazine during long-term treatment of patients with  NSTE-ACS receiving standard therapy (N = 6500). Eligible patients are randomized  1:1 to ranolazine or matched placebo, initiated as 200 mg intravenously over 1  hour, followed by an 80-mg/h infusion (40 mg/h for patients with severe renal  insufficiency) for up to 96 hours and oral ranolazine ER 1000 mg BID or matched  placebo until the end of study. The primary end point is the time to first  occurrence of any element of the composite of cardiovascular death, myocardial  infarction, or recurrent ischemia. Secondary end points include ischemia on  Holter monitoring, hospitalization for new or worsening heart failure, quality  of life measures, and exercise performance. The evaluation of long-term safety  will include death from any cause and symptomatic documented arrhythmia.  Recruitment began in October 2004. The trial will continue until 730 major  cardiovascular events and 310 deaths are recorded with expected completion in 24  to 28 months. CONCLUSIONS: MERLIN-TIMI 36 will evaluate the role of ranolazine in the acute  and chronic management of patients presenting with NSTE-ACS.']","Ranolazine has only a small effect on the basal calcium current, while it greatly affects whole cell calcium current when facilitated by beta-adrenoceptor or histamine receptor activation.

53,Why does cranberry juice help combat urinary tract infections?,"['Flavonoids, present in high levels in cranberries, are potent bioactives known  for their health-promoting benefits, but cranberry beverages (CB) are not  typically recommended as part of a healthy diet. We examine the association  between CB consumption with macronutrient intake and weight status. Data for US  adults (≥19 years, n = 10,891) were taken from the National Health and Nutrition  Examination Survey (NHANES) Survey 2005-2008. Total CB consumption was measured  over two non-consecutive 24-h dietary recalls. Linear and logistic regression  models adjusting for important covariates were used to examine predicted  differences between CB consumers and non-consumers on macronutrient and  anthropometric outcomes. Results are weighted to be nationally representative.  CB consumers (n = 581) were older (>50 year) non-Hispanic black females. They  consumed an average 221 mL (7.5 oz) CB per day. In fully adjusted models CB  consumers (vs. non-consumers) had higher carbohydrates and total sugars and  lower percent energy from protein and total fat (all p < 0.001), but no  difference in total energy. A significantly higher proportion of CB consumers  were predicted to be normal weight (BMI < 25 kg/m2; p = 0.001) and had to have  lower waist circumferences (p = 0.001). Although there was not a significant  trend across level of CB intake, low and middle level CB consumers compared to  non-consumers were more likely to be normal weight (p < 0.001) and less likely  to be overweight/obese (BMI ≥ 25 kg/m2, p < 0.001). Despite having slightly  higher daily macronutrient intakes, CB consumers have more desirable  anthropometric measures compared to non-consumers.', 'Cranberry juice cocktail (CJC) has been shown to inhibit the formation of  biofilm by uropathogenic Escherichia coli. In order to investigate whether the  anti-adhesive components could reach the urinary tract after oral consumption of  CJC, a volunteer was given 16\u2009oz of either water or CJC. Urine samples were  collected at 0, 2, 4, 6, and 8 hours after consumption of a single dose. The  ability of compounds in the urine to influence bacterial adhesion was tested for  six clinical uropathogenic E. coli strains, including four P-fimbriated strains  (B37, CFT073, BF1023, and J96) and two strains not expressing P-fimbriae but  exhibiting mannose-resistant hemagglutination (B73 and B78). A non-fimbriated  strain, HB101, was used as a control. Atomic force microscopy (AFM) was used to  measure the adhesion force between a silicon nitride probe and bacteria treated  with urine samples. Within 2 hours after CJC consumption, bacteria of the  clinical strains treated with the corresponding urine sample demonstrated lower  adhesion forces than those treated with urine collected before CJC consumption.  The adhesion forces continued decreasing with time after CJC consumption over  the 8-hour measurement period. The adhesion forces of bacteria after exposure to  urine collected following water consumption did not change. HB101 showed low  adhesion forces following both water and CJC consumption, and these did not  change over time. The AFM adhesion force measurements were consistent with the  results of a hemagglutination assay, confirming that oral consumption of CJC  could act against adhesion of uropathogenic E. coli.', 'Question Plusieurs enfants de ma clinique se rétablissent d’une infection des  voies urinaires (IVU).

The results of the study have  implications for home care nurses who have similar patients in their case loads.', 'Previous clinical research has suggested that the consumption of cranberry  products prevents the adhesion of Escherichia coli to uroepithelial cells by  causing changes in bacterial fimbriae. Atomic force microscopy was used to probe  the adhesion forces between E. coli (nonfimbriated strain HB101 and the  P-fimbriated variant HB101pDC1) and a model surface (silicon nitride), to  determine the effect of growth in cranberry products on bacterial adhesion.  Bacteria were grown in tryptic soy broth supplemented with either light  cranberry juice cocktail (L-CJC) or cranberry proanthocyanidins (PACs). Growth  of E. coli HB101pDC1 and HB101 in L-CJC or PACs resulted in a decrease in  adhesion forces with increasing number of cultures. In a macroscale  bacteria-uroepithelial cell adhesion assay a decrease in bacterial attachment  was observed for E. coli HB101pDC1 grown in L-CJC or PACs. This effect was  reversible because bacteria that were regrown in cranberry-free medium regained  their ability to attach to uroepithelial cells, and their adhesion forces  reverted to the values observed in the control condition. Exposure to increasing  concentrations of L-CJC resulted in a decrease of bacterial attachment to  uroepithelial cells for the P-fimbriated strain after L-CJC treatment (27% by  weight) and after PACs treatment (345.8 microg/mL). Cranberry products affect  the surface properties, such as fimbriae and lipopolysaccharides, and adhesion  of fimbriated and nonfimbriated E. coli. The concentration of cranberry products  and the number of cultures the bacteria were exposed to cranberry determines how  much the adhesion forces and attachment are altered.', 'Flavonoids, present in high levels in cranberries, are potent bioactives known  for their health-promoting benefits, but cranberry beverages (CB) are not  typically recommended as part of a healthy diet.

Intravesical Bacillus Calmette-Guerin is used to treat  patients with superficial bladder cancer. The proposed mechanism of action of  Bacillus Calmette-Guerin is adherence to the urothelium with induction of an  immunologic and/or inflammatory response. The current study was designed to  determine if rabbit bladder mucin removal results in increased Bacillus  Calmette-Guerin urothelial adherence. PAS and colloidal iron stains were used to  demonstrate that intravesical instillation of 50% acetone renders rabbit bladder  urothelium mucin deficient. The urothelium remains mucin deficient at two hours,  but by 24 hours the mucin layer has been regenerated. Two hours following  intravesical 3H-labeled Escherichia coli administration, bacterial adherence was  29-fold greater in mucin deficient than mucin intact rabbits (p = 0.05). By 12  hours, the difference in adherence was not significant.

Creatine supplementation decreases oxidative DNA damage and lipid  peroxidation induced by a single bout of resistance exercise.

It is used as an ergogenic aid  to improve muscle mass, strength, and endurance. Heretofore, Cr's positive  therapeutic benefits in various oxidative stress-associated diseases have been  reported in the literature and, recently, Cr has also been shown to exert direct  antioxidant effects. Therefore, the purpose of this study was to investigate the  effects of an acute bout of resistance exercise (RE) on oxidative stress  response and oxidative DNA damage in male athletes and whether supplementation  with Cr could negate any observed differences. Twenty-seven resistance-trained  men were randomly divided into a Cr supplementation group (the Cr group [21.6 ±  3.6 years], taking 4 × 5 g Cr monohydrate per day) or a placebo (PL)  supplementation group (the PL group [21.2 ± 3.2 years], taking 4 × 5 g  maltodextrin per day). A double-blind research design was employed for a 7-day  supplementation period. Before and after the seventh day of supplementation, the  subjects performed an RE protocol (7 sets of 4 exercises using 60-90 1  repetition maximum) in the flat pyramid loading pattern. Blood and urine samples  taken before, immediately, and 24-hour postexercise were analyzed for plasma  malondialdehyde (MDA) and urinary 8-hydroxy-2-deoxyguanosine (8-OHdG) excretion.  Before the supplementation period, a significant increase in the urinary 8-OHdG  excretion and plasma MDA levels was observed after RE. The Cr supplementation  induces a significant increase in athletics performance, and it attenuated the  changes observed in the urinary 8-OHdG excretion and plasma MDA. These results  indicate that Cr supplementation reduced oxidative DNA damage and lipid  peroxidation induced by a single bout of RE."", 'OBJECTIVES: To investigate upper urinary tract stone composition rates in  Australia To investigate changes in stone composition in Australia over the past  30 years PATIENTS AND METHODS: The Institute for Clinical Pathology and Medical Research  (ICPMR) database was used to obtain - stone composition statistics from  2009-2011 Historical comparisons of stone composition rates were obtained from  previous Australian studies; Rofe; 1981, and Baker; 1993 for epidemiological  data from the 1970s and 1980s respectively. Stone composition data was separated  into gender and age-groups RESULTS: From the 791 stones analysed between 2009 and 2011, calcium oxalate  remains the dominant type accounting for 64% of stones in our dataset, which  compares to 68% from both the 1970s and 1980s. Uric acid stones contributed 16%  of contemporary stone compositions, comparable to 16% in the 1970s and 17% in  the 1980s. Struvite stones showed a decreasing trend from 14% in the 1970s, to  12% in the 1980s and 7% in the current data. For struvite stones, while the  female 21-30 age-group was the most prolific for struvite stone formation in the  1980s, the peak group in contemporaneous records is 61-70 year-old men. CONCLUSION: Stone composition in Australia has remained relatively static over  the past 30 years. Modifications in diet and body habitus have not resulted in  significant changes in the proportion of uric acid and calcium oxalate stones  detected. The decreasing trend in the proportion of struvite stones most likely  reflects improved management of urinary tract infections within the Australian  population.', 'Type 1 fimbriae and flagella, two surface organelles critical for colonization  of the urinary tract by uropathogenic Escherichia coli (UPEC), mediate opposing  virulence objectives. Type 1 fimbriae facilitate adhesion to mucosal cells and  promote bacterial persistence in the urinary tract, while flagella propel  bacteria through urine and along mucous layers during ascension to the upper  urinary tract. Using a transposon screen of the E. coli CFT073 fim locked-ON  (L-ON) mutant, a construct that constitutively expresses type 1 fimbriae and  represses motility, we identified six mutants that exhibited a partial  restoration of motility. Among these six mutated genes was mutS, which encodes a  component of the methyl-directed mismatch repair (MMR) system. When complemented  with mutS in trans, motility was again repressed. To determine whether the MMR  system, in general, is involved in this reciprocal control, we characterized the  effects of gene deletions of other MMR components on UPEC motility. Isogenic  deletions of mutS, mutH, and mutL were constructed in both wild-type CFT073 and  fim L-ON backgrounds. All MMR mutants showed an increase in motility in the  wild-type background, and ΔmutH and ΔmutS mutations increased motility in the  fim L-ON background. Cochallenge of the wild-type strain with an MMR-defective  strain showed a subtle but significant competitive advantage in the bladder and  spleen for the MMR mutant using the murine model of ascending urinary tract  infection after 48 h. Our findings demonstrate that the MMR system generally  affects the reciprocal regulation of motility and adherence and thus could  contribute to UPEC pathogenesis during urinary tract infections.']","Cranberry products affect the surface properties, such as fimbriae and lipopolysaccharides, and adhesion of fimbriated and nonfimbriated E. coli."
54,How are cryptic unstable transcripts (CUTs) defined?,"[""Studies of yeast transcription have revealed the widespread distribution of  intergenic RNA polymerase II transcripts. These cryptic unstable transcripts  (CUTs) are rapidly degraded by the nuclear exosome. Yeast RNA binding proteins  Nrd1 and Nab3 direct termination of sn/snoRNAs and recently have also been  implicated in premature transcription termination of the NRD1 gene. In this  paper, we show that Nrd1 and Nab3 are required for transcription termination of  CUTs. In nrd1 and nab3 mutants, we observe 3'-extended transcripts originating  from CUT promoters but failing to terminate through the Nrd1- and Nab3-directed  pathway. Nrd1 and Nab3 colocalize to regions of the genome expressing antisense  CUTs, and these transcripts require yeast nuclear exosome and TRAMP components  for degradation. Dissection of a CUT terminator reveals a minimal element  sufficient for Nrd1- and Nab3-directed termination. These results suggest that  transcription termination of CUTs directed by Nrd1 and Nab3 is a prerequisite  for rapid degradation by the nuclear exosome."", 'It is well established that eukaryotic genomes are pervasively transcribed  producing cryptic unstable transcripts (CUTs). However, the mechanisms  regulating pervasive transcription are not well understood. Here, we report that  the fission yeast CENP-B homolog Abp1 plays an important role in preventing  pervasive transcription. We show that loss of abp1 results in the accumulation  of CUTs, which are targeted for degradation by the exosome pathway. These CUTs  originate from different types of genomic features, but the highest increase  corresponds to Tf2 retrotransposons and rDNA repeats, where they map along the  entire elements. In the absence of abp1, increased RNAPII-Ser5P occupancy is  observed throughout the Tf2 coding region and, unexpectedly, RNAPII-Ser5P is  enriched at rDNA repeats. Loss of abp1 also results in Tf2 derepression and  increased nucleolus size. Altogether these results suggest that Abp1 prevents  pervasive RNAPII transcription of repetitive DNA elements (i.e., Tf2 and rDNA  repeats) from internal cryptic sites.', ""A complete description of the transcriptome of an organism is crucial for a  comprehensive understanding of how it functions and how its transcriptional  networks are controlled, and may provide insights into the organism's evolution.  Despite the status of Saccharomyces cerevisiae as arguably the most well-studied  model eukaryote, we still do not have a full catalog or understanding of all its  genes. In order to interrogate the transcriptome of S. cerevisiae for low  abundance or rapidly turned over transcripts, we deleted elements of the RNA  degradation machinery with the goal of preferentially increasing the relative  abundance of such transcripts. We then used high-resolution tiling microarrays  and ultra high-throughput sequencing (UHTS) to identify, map, and validate  unannotated transcripts that are more abundant in the RNA degradation mutants  relative to wild-type cells. We identified 365 currently unannotated  transcripts, the majority presumably representing low abundance or short-lived  RNAs, of which 185 are previously unknown and unique to this study. It is likely  that many of these are cryptic unstable transcripts (CUTs), which are rapidly  degraded and whose function(s) within the cell are still unclear, while others  may be novel functional transcripts. Of the 185 transcripts we identified as  novel to our study, greater than 80 percent come from regions of the genome that  have lower conservation scores amongst closely related yeast species than 85  percent of the verified ORFs in S. cerevisiae. Such regions of the genome have  typically been less well-studied, and by definition transcripts from these  regions will distinguish S. cerevisiae from these closely related species."", 'Recent studies on yeast transcriptome have revealed the presence of a large set  of RNA polymerase II transcripts mapping to intergenic and antisense regions or  overlapping canonical genes. Most of these ncRNAs (ncRNAs) are subject to  termination by the Nrd1-dependent pathway and rapid degradation by the nuclear  exosome and have been dubbed cryptic unstable transcripts (CUTs). CUTs are often  considered as by-products of transcriptional noise, but in an increasing number  of cases they play a central role in the control of gene expression. Regulatory  mechanisms involving expression of a CUT are diverse and include attenuation,  transcriptional interference, and alternative transcription start site choice.  This review focuses on the impact of cryptic transcription on gene expression,  describes the role of the Nrd1-complex as the main actor in preventing  nonfunctional and potentially harmful transcription, and details a few systems  where expression of a CUT has an essential regulatory function. We also  summarize the most recent studies concerning other types of ncRNAs and their  possible role in regulation.', ""BACKGROUND: Cryptic unstable transcripts (CUTs) are a largely unexplored class  of nuclear exosome degraded, non-coding RNAs in budding yeast. It is highly  debated whether CUT transcription has a functional role in the cell or whether  CUTs represent noise in the yeast transcriptome. We sought to ascertain the  extent of conserved CUT expression across a variety of Saccharomyces yeast  strains to further understand and characterize the nature of CUT expression. RESULTS: We sequenced the WT and rrp6Δ transcriptomes of three S.cerevisiae  strains: S288c, Σ1278b, JAY291 and the S.paradoxus strain N17 and utilized a  hidden Markov model to annotate CUTs in these four strains. Utilizing a four-way  genomic alignment we identified a large population of CUTs with conserved  syntenic expression across all four strains. By identifying configurations of  gene-CUT pairs, where CUT expression originates from the gene 5' or 3'  nucleosome free region, we observed distinct gene expression trends specific to  these configurations which were most prevalent in the presence of conserved CUT  expression. Divergent pairs correlate with higher expression of genes, and  convergent pairs correlate with reduced gene expression. CONCLUSIONS: Our RNA-seq based method has greatly expanded upon previous CUT  annotations in S.cerevisiae underscoring the extensive and pervasive nature of  unstable transcription. Furthermore we provide the first assessment of conserved  CUT expression in yeast and globally demonstrate possible modes of CUT-based  regulation of gene expression."", 'MOTIVATION: RNA-Seq technology is promising to uncover many novel alternative  splicing events, gene fusions and other variations in RNA transcripts. For an  accurate detection and quantification of transcripts, it is important to resolve  the mapping ambiguity for those RNA-Seq reads that can be mapped to multiple  loci: >17% of the reads from mouse RNA-Seq data and 50% of the reads from some  plant RNA-Seq data have multiple mapping loci. In this study, we show how to  resolve the mapping ambiguity in the presence of novel transcriptomic events  such as exon skipping and novel indels towards accurate downstream analysis. We  introduce ORMAN ( O ptimal R esolution of M ultimapping A mbiguity of R N A-Seq  Reads), which aims to compute the minimum number of potential transcript  products for each gene and to assign each multimapping read to one of these  transcripts based on the estimated distribution of the region covering the read.  ORMAN achieves this objective through a combinatorial optimization formulation,  which is solved through well-known approximation algorithms, integer linear  programs and heuristics. RESULTS: On a simulated RNA-Seq dataset including a random subset of transcripts  from the UCSC database, the performance of several state-of-the-art methods for  identifying and quantifying novel transcripts, such as Cufflinks, IsoLasso and  CLIIQ, is significantly improved through the use of ORMAN. Furthermore, in an  experiment using real RNA-Seq reads, we show that ORMAN is able to resolve  multimapping to produce coverage values that are similar to the original  distribution, even in genes with highly non-uniform coverage. AVAILABILITY: ORMAN is available at http://orman.sf.net', 'Messenger RNAs (mRNAs) that contain premature translation termination codons  (PTCs) are targeted for rapid degradation in all eukaryotes tested. The  mechanisms of nonsense-mediated mRNA decay (NMD) have been described in  considerable detail, but the biological roles of NMD in wild-type organisms are  poorly understood. mRNAs of wild-type organisms known to be degraded by NMD  (""natural targets"" of NMD) include by-products of regulated alternative  splicing, out-of-frame mRNAs derived from unproductive gene rearrangements,  cytoplasmic pre-mRNAs, endogenous retroviral and transposon RNAs, and mRNAs  having upstream open reading frames or other unusual sequence features. NMD may  function to eliminate aberrant PTC-containing mRNAs in order to protect cells  from expression of potentially deleterious truncated proteins. Pseudogenes are  nonfunctional genes or gene fragments that accumulate mutations through genetic  drift. Such mutations will often introduce shifts of reading frame and/or PTCs,  and mRNAs of expressed pseudogenes may thus be substrates of NMD. We demonstrate  that mRNAs expressed from C. elegans pseudogenes are degraded by NMD and discuss  possible implications for both mRNA surveillance and protein evolution. We  describe an expressed pseudogene that encodes a small nucleolar RNA (snoRNA)  within an intron and suggest this represents an evolutionary intermediate  between snoRNA-encoding host genes that do or do not encode proteins.', 'BACKGROUND: RNA-seq data is currently underutilized, in part because it is  difficult to predict the functional impact of alternate transcription events.  Recent software improvements in full-length transcript deconvolution prompted us  to develop spliceR, an R package for classification of alternative splicing and  prediction of coding potential. RESULTS: spliceR uses the full-length transcript output from RNA-seq assemblers  to detect single or multiple exon skipping, alternative donor and acceptor  sites, intron retention, alternative first or last exon usage, and mutually  exclusive exon events. For each of these events spliceR also annotates the  genomic coordinates of the differentially spliced elements, facilitating  downstream sequence analysis. For each transcript isoform fraction values are  calculated to identify transcript switching between conditions. Lastly, spliceR  predicts the coding potential, as well as the potential nonsense mediated decay  (NMD) sensitivity of each transcript.

Moreover, correlation between diseases and the shortening (or lengthening) of 3'  UTRs has been reported in the literature. This length is largely determined by  the polyadenylation cleavage site in the mRNA. As alternative polyadenylation  (APA) sites are common in mammalian genes, several tools have been published  recently for detecting APA sites from RNA-Seq data or performing  shortening/lengthening analysis. These tools consider either up to only two APA  sites in a gene or only APA sites that occur in the last exon of a gene,  although a gene may generally have more than two APA sites and an APA site may  sometimes occur before the last exon. Furthermore, the tools are unable to  integrate the analysis of shortening/lengthening events with APA site detection. RESULTS: We propose a new tool, called TAPAS, for detecting novel APA sites from  RNA-Seq data. It can deal with more than two APA sites in a gene as well as APA  sites that occur before the last exon. The tool is based on an existing method  for finding change points in time series data, but some filtration techniques  are also adopted to remove change points that are likely false APA sites. It is  then extended to identify APA sites that are expressed differently between two  biological samples and genes that contain 3' UTRs with shortening/lengthening  events. Our extensive experiments on simulated and real RNA-Seq data demonstrate  that TAPAS outperforms the existing tools for APA site detection or  shortening/lengthening analysis significantly.

PCC is composed of two  subunits, alpha and beta, encoded by the PCCA and PCCB genes, respectively. We  analyzed mutations of the PCCA gene using patients' fibroblasts diagnosed with  alpha subunit deficiency. By RT-PCR, four of 12 cell lines examined appeared to  have a larger transcript present at a level comparable with that of the expected  normal species. Sequencing of the larger transcriptrevealed an 84 bp insertion  at nt 1209 of the codingsequence. Its incorporation in the transcript results in  translation termination due to the presence of two in-frame stop codons. The 84  bp insertion was found to originate from the intron between nt 1209 and 1210.  Consensus splice donor and acceptor sites were found at the 3'- and 5'-ends of  the insertion, respectively. The insertion was also found in the remaining eight  cell lines as well as in normal cells, but at a muchreduced level compared with  the normal lengthsequence. Mutation analysis of the four cell lines showing  seemingly elevated levels of the insertion sequence revealed one nonsense  mutation (R288X), two frameshift deletions (700del5 and 1115del4) and one splice  mutation (1671IVS+5G-->C) as expressed alleles. We conclude that the common  characteristic of the four cell lines is that they contain mRNA destabilizing  mutations that reduce the mRNA level of the normal length sequence.  Consequently, the low levels of cryptic mRNAs become detectable at a level  similar to that of the residual level of the normal length mRNA. We suggest that  screening for an increased proportion of the 84 bp insertion by RT-PCR can be  used as a rapid assay for RNA destabilizing mutations.

55,What is Abbreviated Injury Scale (AIS) used to determine?,"[""BACKGROUND: Injury severity measures are based either on the Abbreviated Injury  Scale (AIS) or the International Classification of diseases (ICD). The latter is  more convenient because routinely collected by clinicians for administrative  reasons. To exploit this advantage, a proprietary program that maps ICD-9-CM  into AIS codes has been used for many years. Recently, a program called ICDPIC  trauma and developed in the USA has become available free of charge for  registered STATA users. We compared the ICDPIC calculated Injury Severity Score  (ISS) with the one from direct, prospective AIS coding by expert trauma  registrars (dAIS). METHODS: The administrative records of the 289 major trauma cases admitted to  the hospital of Udine-Italy from 1 July 2004 to 30 June 2005 and enrolled in the  Italian Trauma Registry were retrieved and ICDPIC-ISS was calculated. The  agreement between ICDPIC-ISS and dAIS-ISS was assessed by Cohen's Kappa and  Bland-Altman charts. We then plotted the differences between the 2 scores  against the ratio between the number of traumatic ICD-9-CM codes and the number  of dAIS codes for each patient (DIARATIO). We also compared the absolute  differences in ISS among 3 groups identified by DIARATIO. The discriminative  power for survival of both scores was finally calculated by ROC curves. RESULTS: The scores matched in 33/272 patients (12.1%, k 0.07) and, when  categorized, in 80/272 (22.4%, k 0.09). The Bland-Altman average difference was  6.36 (limits: minus 22.0 to plus 34.7). ICDPIC-ISS of 75 was particularly  unreliable. The differences increased (p < 0.01) as DIARATIO increased  indicating incomplete administrative coding as a cause of the differences. The  area under the curve of ICDPIC-ISS was lower (0.63 vs. 0.76, p = 0.02). CONCLUSIONS: Despite its great potential convenience, ICPIC-ISS agreed poorly  with its conventionally calculated counterpart. Its discriminative power for  survival was also significantly lower. Incomplete ICD-9-CM coding was a main  cause of these findings. Because this quality of coding is standard in Italy and  probably in other European countries, its effects on the performances of other  trauma scores based on ICD administrative data deserve further research. Mapping  ICD-9-CM code 862.8 to AIS of 6 is an overestimation."", 'Injuries from piercing or cutting instruments or objects are commonly seen in  the pediatric emergency department. In this study, we present the epidemiology  of piercing injuries resulting in hospitalization. Medical records for a  one-year period with E-codes 920.0-920.9 were reviewed for victim-related  demographic data, anatomic injury location, vehicle of injury, treatment, and  hospital charges. The Abbreviated Injury Scale (AIS) was used to ascertain  injury severity. The most common vehicles of injury were glass (n = 24, 34%),  nails (n = 11, 16%), and needles (n = 10, 14%). The median AIS score was  significantly higher for hand injuries compared to the sample median AIS.  Piercing injuries from consumer-related products were associated with the  highest AIS scores (median = 2.5). Although the mean AIS for all injuries was  only 1.5, these injuries resulted in significant costs, with a mean  hospitalization charge of $3884 +/- 3528. Surgical procedures under general  anesthesia were required in 81% of the patients.', 'Given the wide usage and proven value of the Abbreviated Injury Scale (AIS) in  rating severity of trauma, it is essential that certain reliability issues  concerning its application be resolved. This article describes a study designed  to address these reliability issues. Each of 15 raters with varying  qualifications was asked to identify AIS code injuries sustained by 375 trauma  patients admitted to four Baltimore area hospitals. Results showed that as a  group, physicians and nurses tend to be more reliable in their ratings than  either emergency medical technicians (EMTs) or nonclinical technicians, although  a research assistant who is well trained in AIS coding and is a diligent worker  can use the AIS to code severity as reliably as the physicians when sufficient  information is provided in the medical chart. Reliability of AIS scoring was  somewhat higher for blunt (vehicular and nonvehicular) versus penetrating  injuries.', 'INTRODUCTION: Traumatic brain injury (TBI) is a major public health problem,  particularly in children. Prognostication of injury severity at the time of  presentation is difficult. The Abbreviated Injury Scale (AIS) is a commonly used  anatomical-based coding system created to classify and describe injury severity  after initial presentation, once test results are able to better define the  anatomical characteristics of the injury. We hypothesize that the Head AIS can  predict discharge destination in children after TBI. METHODS: The trauma registry database for a Pediatric Level 1 Trauma center was  queried for patients age ≤14\xa0years from 2006 to 2015 with a Head AIS>2. All  diagnoses with head AIS>2 were retrieved. Since one patient can have multiple  diagnoses with an AIS>2, we selected the diagnosis with highest Head AIS  associated with each patient. The demographics, length of stay, and the  discharge disposition of patients were retrieved. Descriptive statistics were  performed and association of Head AIS with the length of stay and discharge  disposition was determined using logistic regression. RESULTS: 393 pediatric patients (age≤14\xa0years) with an Head AIS ≥3, (64.0%  males, mean age\xa0=\xa06.2\xa0S.D. 4.58) presented over 10\xa0years. Head AIS was strongly  associated with mortality; with 0.8%, 1.1% and 42.0% of patients with Head AIS  of 3, 4 and 5, respectively, dying - odds ratio for Head AIS 5 over Head AIS  3\xa0=\xa089 (logistic regression, p-value<0.001). 80.0% of deaths (23 patients) in  this cohort occurred within 24-h of presentation. Head AIS was associated with  an increase likelihood of discharge to rehabilitation with 1.2%, 7.7% and 47.0%  of survivors discharging to rehabilitation for Head AIS of 3, 4 and 5. CONCLUSION: Head AIS can reliably predict discharge disposition to home, rehab  or death. Calculation of Head AIS prior to discharge could lead to accurate  prediction of discharge destination.', 'Trauma, which accounts for a substantial part of the morbidity and mortality in  industrial nations, is a natural area of interest for orthopaedic surgeons.

The aim of this study was to analyze the  association between posttraumatic complications and the injured body region,  injury and trauma severity, length of stay, and mortality in hospitalized trauma  patients. This observational and retrospective study included 147 trauma  patients with posttraumatic complications hospitalized in a university hospital  located in São Paulo, Brazil.

The association between variables was verified applying χ test,  Fisher exact text, likelihood ratio, and Mann-Whitney U test, considering  significance level of 5%. The most frequent in-hospital complications were  infectious, cardiovascular, metabolic, and renal. Patients with head injury AIS  score of 3 or more had higher percentage of neurological complications and those  with lower extremity injury AIS score of less than 3 had higher percentage of  metabolic and renal complications. There was no association between thoracic  injury and cardiovascular complications, nor between types of complications and  trauma severity (ISS). Patients without cardiovascular complication and those  with infections had longer hospital length of stay, and mortality was higher in  those with cardiovascular complications.

METHODS: Data were collected from the Korean In-Depth Accident Study database  based on actual accident investigation. The noncatastrophic criteria were  classified according to U.S. experts from the Centers for Disease Control and  Prevention's recommendations for field triage guidelines of high-risk automobile  crash criteria by vehicle intrusions more than 12 in. on occupant sites  (including the roof) and more than 18 in. on any site. The Abbreviated Injury  Scale (AIS) was used to determine injury patterns for each body region. Severely  injured patients were classified as Maximum Abbreviated Injury Scale (MAIS) 3 or  higher. RESULTS: In this study, the most significant injury regions were the head and  neck, extremities, and thorax. In addition, the incidence of severe injury among  elderly patients was nearly 1.6 times higher than that of non-elderly patients.  According to age group, injured body regions among the elderly were the thorax,  head and neck, and extremities, in that order. For the non-elderly groups, these  were head and neck, extremities, and thorax. Severe injury rates were slightly  different for the elderly group (head and neck, abdomen) and non-elderly group  (thorax, head and neck). CONCLUSIONS: In both age groups, the rate of severe injury is proportional to an  increase in crush extent zone.

However, the OARs have not been  evaluated as an acute clinical evaluation tool. OBJECTIVE: To evaluate the measures of diagnostic accuracy of the OARs in the  acute setting. METHODS: The OARs were applied to all appropriate ankle injuries at 2 colleges  (athletics and club sports) and 21 high schools. The outcomes of OARs,  diagnosis, and decision for referral were collected by the athletic trainers  (ATs) at each of the locations. Contingency tables were created for evaluations  completed within 1 h for which radiographs were obtained. From these data the  sensitivity, specificity, positive and negative likelihood ratios, and positive  and negative predictive values were calculated. RESULTS: The OARs met the criteria for radiographs in 100 of the 124 cases, of  which 38 were actually referred for imaging. Based on radiographic findings in  an acute setting, the OARs (n = 38) had a high sensitivity (.88) and are good  predictors to rule out the presence of a fracture. Low specificity (0.00)  results led to a high number of false positives and low positive predictive  values (.18). CONCLUSION: When applied during the first hour after injury the OARs  significantly overestimate the need for radiographs. However, a negative finding  rules out the need to obtain radiographs. It appears the AT's decision making  based on the totality of the examination findings is the best filter in  determining referral for radiographs.""]","The Abbreviated Injury Scale (AIS) is an objective anatomically-based injury severity scoring system that classifies each injury by body region on a 6 point scale.

56,Tumor-treating fields are effective for treatment of which cancers?,"['INTRODUCTION: Local control is fundamental, both for the curative as well as the  palliative treatment of cancer. Tumor treating fields (TTFields) are low  intensity (1 ? 2 V/cm), intermediate frequency (100 ? 200 kHz) alternating  electric fields administered using insulated electrodes placed on the skin  surrounding the region of a malignant tumor. TTFields were shown to destroy  cells within the process of mitosis via apoptosis, thereby inhibiting tumor  growth. TTFields have no effect on non-dividing cells. AREAS COVERED: This article reviews in vitro and in vivo preclinical studies,  demonstrating the activity of TTFields both as a monotherapy as well as in  combination with several cytotoxic agents. Furthermore, it summarizes the  clinical experience with TTFields, mainly in two indications: one in recurrent  glioblastoma multiforme: in a large prospective randomized Phase III trial  TTFields was compared with best standard care (including chemotherapy): TTFields  significantly improved median overall survival (OS) compared with standard  therapy (7.8 vs 6.1 months) for the patients treated per protocol. Importantly,  quality of life was also better in the TTFields group. The second indication was  a Phase II study in second-line non-small cell lung cancer, where TTFields was  administered concomitantly with pemetrexed. This combination resulted in an  excellent median OS of 13.8 months. Interestingly, the progression-free survival  (PFS) within the area of the TTFields was 28, however, outside the TTFields the  PFS was only 22 weeks. EXPERT OPINION: The proof of concept of TTFields has been well demonstrated in  the preclinical setting, and the clinical data seem promising in various tumor  types. The side effects of TTFields were minimal and in general consisted of  skin reaction to the electrodes. There are a number of ways in which TTFields  could be further evaluated, for example, in combination with chemotherapy, as a  maintenance treatment, or as a salvage therapy if radiotherapy or surgery is not  possible. While more clinical data are clearly needed, TTFields is an emerging  and promising novel treatment concept.', 'Tumor treating fields (TTFields) are low intensity, intermediate frequency,  alternating electric fields used to treat cancerous tumors. This novel treatment  modality effectively inhibits the growth of solid tumors in vivo and has shown  promise in pilot clinical trials in patients with advanced stage solid tumors.  TTFields were tested for their potential to inhibit metastatic spread of solid  tumors to the lungs in two animal models: (1) Mice injected with malignant  melanoma cells (B16F10) into the tail vein, (2) New Zealand White rabbits  implanted with VX-2 tumors within the kidney capsule. Mice and rabbits were  treated using two-directional TTFields at 100-200 kHz. Animals were either  monitored for survival, or sacrificed for pathological and histological analysis  of the lungs. The total number of lung surface metastases and the absolute  weight of the lungs were both significantly lower in TTFields treated mice then  in sham control mice. TTFields treated rabbits survived longer than sham control  animals. This extension in survival was found to be due to an inhibition of  metastatic spread, seeding or growth in the lungs of TTFields treated rabbits  compared to controls. Histologically, extensive peri- and intra-tumoral immune  cell infiltration was seen in TTFields treated rabbits only. These results raise  the possibility that in addition to their proven inhibitory effect on the growth  of solid tumors, TTFields may also have clinical benefit in the prevention of  metastatic spread from primary tumors.', ""The NovoTTF™-100A system is a portable device that delivers intermediate  frequency alternating electric fields (TTFields, tumor treating fields) through  transducer arrays arranged on the scalp. An ongoing trial is assessing its  efficacy for newly diagnosed glioblastoma multiforme (GBM) and it has been  FDA-approved for recurrent GBM.The fields are believed to interfere with  formation of the mitotic spindle as well as to affect polar molecules at  telophase, thus preventing cell division. The position of the four arrays is  unique to each patient and optimized based on the patient's imaging. We present  three patients with GBM in whom the fields were adjusted at recurrence and the  effects of each adjustment. We believe there may be a higher risk of treatment  failure on the edges of the field where the field strength may be lower. The  first patient underwent subtotal resection, radiotherapy with temozolomide  (TMZ), and then began NovoTTF Therapy with metronomic TMZ. She had good control  for nine months; however, new bifrontal lesions developed, and her fields were  adjusted with a subsequent radiographic response. Over the next five months, her  tumor burden increased and death was preceded by a right insular recurrence. A  second patient underwent two resections followed by radiotherapy/TMZ and NovoTTF  Therapy/TMZ. Six months later, two new distal lesions were noted, and he  underwent further resection with adjustment of his fields. He remained stable  over the subsequent year on NovoTTF Therapy and bevacizumab. A third patient on  NovoTTF Therapy/TMZ remained stable for two years but developed a small, slow  growing enhancing lesion, which was resected, and his fields were adjusted  accordingly. Interestingly, the pathology showed giant cell GBM with multiple  syncitial-type cells. Based on these observations, we believe that field  strength may play a role in 'out of field' recurrences and that either the  presence of a certain field strength may select for cells that are of a  different size or that tumor cells may change size to avoid the effects of the  TTFields."", 'OBJECTIVES: Tumor Treating Fields (TTFields) are a non-invasive cancer treatment  modality approved for the treatment of patients with recurrent glioblastoma. The  present study determined the efficacy and mechanism of action of TTFields in  preclinical models of pancreatic cancer. METHODS: The effect of TTFields in vitro was assessed using cell counts,  clonogenic assays, cell cycle analysis and analysis of mitotic figures. The  effect in vivo effect was studied in the PC1-0 hamster pancreatic cancer model. RESULTS: Application of TTFields in vitro showed a significant decrease in cell  count, an increase in cell volume and reduced clonogenicity. Further analysis  demonstrated significant increase in the number of abnormal mitotic figures, as  well as a decrease in G2-M cell population. In hamsters with orthotopic  pancreatic tumors, TTFields significantly reduced tumor volume accompanied by an  increase in the frequency of abnormal mitotic events. TTFields efficacy was  enhanced both in vitro and in vivo when combined with chemotherapy. CONCLUSIONS: These results provide the first evidence that TTFields serve as an  effective antimitotic treatment in preclinical pancreatic cancer models and have  a long term negative effect on cancer cell survival. These results make TTFields  an attractive candidate for testing in the treatment of patients with pancreatic  cancer.', 'Non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) is one of the leading causes of  cancer-related deaths worldwide. Common treatment modalities for NSCLC include  surgery, radiotherapy, chemotherapy, and, in recent years, the clinical  management paradigm has evolved with the advent of targeted therapies. Despite  such advances, the impact of systemic therapies for advanced disease remains  modest, and as such, the prognosis for patients with NSCLC remains poor.  Standard modalities are not without their respective toxicities and there is a  clear need to improve both efficacy and safety for current management  approaches. Tumor-treating fields (TTFields) are low-intensity,  intermediate-frequency alternating electric fields that disrupt proper spindle  microtubule arrangement, thereby leading to mitotic arrest and ultimately to  cell death. We evaluated the effects of combining TTFields with standard  chemotherapeutic agents on several NSCLC cell lines, both in vitro and in vivo.  Frequency titration curves demonstrated that the inhibitory effects of TTFields  were maximal at 150 kHz for all NSCLC cell lines tested, and that the addition  of TTFields to chemotherapy resulted in enhanced treatment efficacy across all  cell lines. We investigated the response of Lewis lung carcinoma and KLN205  squamous cell carcinoma in mice treated with TTFields in combination with  pemetrexed, cisplatin, or paclitaxel and compared these to the efficacy observed  in mice exposed only to the single agents. Combining TTFields with these  therapeutic agents enhanced treatment efficacy in comparison with the respective  single agents and control groups in all animal models. Together, these findings  suggest that combining TTFields therapy with chemotherapy may provide an  additive efficacy benefit in the management of NSCLC.', 'The tumor microenvironment is a complex assortment of cells that includes a  variety of leukocytes. The overall effect of the microenvironment is to support  the growth of tumors and suppress immune responses. Immunotherapy is a highly  promising form of cancer treatment, but its efficacy can be severely compromised  by an immunosuppressive tumor microenvironment. Chemotherapy and radiation  treatment can mediate tumor reduction through cytotoxic effects, but it is  becoming increasingly clear that these forms of treatment can be used to modify  the tumor microenvironment to liberate tumor antigens and decrease  immunosuppression. Chemotherapy and radiotherapy can be used to modulate the  tumor microenvironment to enhance immunotherapy.', 'PURPOSE: In this study factors are analyzed that may potentially influence the  site of failure in pediatric medulloblastoma. Patient-related, disease-related,  and treatment-related variables are analyzed with a special focus on  radiotherapy time-dose and technical factors. METHODS AND MATERIALS: Eighty-six children and adolescents with a diagnosis of  medulloblastoma were treated in Switzerland during the period 1972-1991.  Postoperative megavoltage radiotherapy was delivered to all patients. Simulation  and portal films of the whole-brain irradiation (WBI) fields were  retrospectively reviewed in 77 patients. The distance from the field margin to  the cribiform plate and to the floor of the temporal fossa was carefully  assessed and correlated with supratentorial failure-free survival. In 19  children the spine was treated with high-energy electron beams, the remainder  with megavoltage photons. Simulation and port films of the posterior fossa  fields were also reviewed in 72 patients. The field size and the field limits  were evaluated and correlated with posterior fossa failure-free survival. RESULTS: In 36 patients (47%) the WBI margins were judged to miss the inferior  portion of the frontal and temporal lobes. Twelve patients failed in the  supratentorial region and 9 of these patients belonged to the group of 36  children in whom the inferior portion of the brain had been underdosed. On  multivariate analysis only field correctness was retained as being significantly  correlated with supratentorial failure-free survival (p = 0.049). Neither the  total dose to the spinal theca nor the treatment technique (electron vs. photon  beams) were significantly correlated with outcome. Posterior fossa failure-free  survival was not influenced by total dose, overall treatment time, field size,  or field margin correctness. Overall survival was not influenced by any of the  radiotherapy-related technical factors. CONCLUSION: A correlation between WBI field correctness and supratentorial  failure-free survival was observed. Treatment protocols should be considered  that limit supratentorial irradiation mainly to subsites at highest risk of  relapse. Optimized conformal therapy or proton beam therapy may help to reach  this goal. Treating the spine with electron beams was not deletereous. A  significant correlation between local control and other technical factors was  not observed, including those relating to posterior fossa treatment. The use of  small conformal tumor bed boost fields may be prefered to the larger posterior  fossa fields usually considered as the standard treatment approach.', ""Photodynamic therapy is being investigated as an adjuvant treatment for  intracranial neoplasms. The efficacy of this therapy is based on the uptake of  photosensitizer by neoplastic tissue, its clearance from surrounding brain  tissue, and the timing and placement of photoactivating sources. Photofrin-II is  the photosensitizer most actively being investigated. We labeled Photofrin-II  with Indium-111 and studied the uptake and distribution of this agent in 20  patients with intracranial neoplasms, using single photon emission computed  tomography (SPECT) with volume rendering in three dimensions. Of these patients,  16 had malignant glial tumors, 2 had metastatic deposits, 1 had a chordoma, and  1 had a meningioma. Anatomical-spatial data correlated well between the SPECT  images and contrast-enhanced computed tomography or magnetic resonance images.  Regions of focal uptake on SPECT images correlated with the surgical  histopathological findings of the neoplasm. The kinetics of photosensitizer  uptake varied according to the tumor's histological findings, the patient's use  of steroids, and among patients with similar types of tumor histology. Peak  ratios of target-to-nontarget tissue varied from 24 to 72 hours after injection.  The study data show that, to be most effective, photodynamic therapy may need to  be tailored for each patient by correlating SPECT images with anatomical data  produced by computed tomography or magnetic resonance images. Photoactivating  sources then can be placed, using computer-assisted stereotactics, to activate a  prescribed volume of photosensitized tumor at the optimal time for treatment."", 'OBJECTIVE: To assess effectiveness of 5-aminolevulinic acid (5-ALA, Gliolan(®))  in patients treated for malignant glioma under typical daily practice conditions  in Spain, using complete resection rate (CR) and progression free survival at 6  months (PFS6). MATERIAL AND METHODS: Retrospective review of data from 18 neurosurgery  departments that were categorised as either using or not using 5-ALA. The study  included adult patients with suspected malignant gliomas for whom the intended  treatment plan included complete resection followed by radiotherapy and  chemotherapy with temozolomide. Postoperative MRI and clinical data representing  at least 6 months were required for inclusion. Rates of CR and PFS6 were  compared between patients with 5-ALA treatment and those without. RESULTS: The study included 251 evaluable cases. CR and PFS6 rates were  significantly higher in the group of patients treated surgically with 5-ALA: CR,  67% versus 45%, p=.000; PFS6 for patients with grade IV tumours, 69% versus 48%;  p=.002. The differences retained their significance and magnitude after  adjusting for all covariates including age, functional status, and whether  gliomas were located in eloquent areas. CONCLUSIONS: In this retrospective series, use of 5-ALA during habitual surgical  procedures in Spain was associated with a higher complete resection rate for  malignant glioma and increased PFS6 for grade iv glioma.', 'The results of various in vitro analyses indicate there is an active immune  response against antigens associated with human malignancies. This immune  response apparently can be augmented by nonspecific immunologic stimulates such  as BCG. These agents are effective for destroying tumor when injected locally  into intracutaneous disease but are not as effective for subcutaneous disease.  Preliminary clinical trials indicated that immune stimulants are effective when  administered systemically. The effect is only minimal for diseminated disease,  but the therapeutic benefit is clearly augmented for patients with a minimal  residual tumor burden, such as those patients with metastases to regional lymph  nodes. Thus immunotherapy is a systemically active mode of therapy. Its toxicity  is minimal, and it appears to be effective in a wide spectrum of the disease.  However, immunotherapy is not effective for a large residual tumor burden;  consequently it must be used in combination with other modes of treatment such  as irradiation therapy or chemotherapy. Early experiences with BCG immunotherapy  for malignant melanoma and C. parvum for oat cell carcinoma are encouraging. It  is remarkable that a nonspecific immunologic stimulant does, in fact, have this  effect. Immunotherapy experiments in animals suggest that in order to achieve  maximal benefit. BCG must have close contact with tumor cells or must be  combined with a tumor-associated antigen. If these principles are true for man,  it would seem that improvements for nonspecific immunotherapy in human neoplasms  would be further augmented if a tumor-related antigen could be extracted from  human tumours and combined with a nonspecific immunologic stimulant.']","Clinical trials have shown that Tumor-treating fields are effective for treatment of non-small cell lung cancer and glioblastoma. Ongoing and future trials will evaluate TTFields in solid tumor brain metastases, and ovarian, pancreatic cancers and multidrug resistance cancer cells."
57,Which properties of the mRNA does N6-methyladenosine (m6A) affect?,"[""N6-Methyladenosine (m6A) residues, which are found internally in viral and  cellular mRNA populations at the sequences Apm6ApC and Gpm6ApC, have been  proposed to play a role in mRNA processing and transport. We have developed a  sensitive approach to analyze the level and location of m6A in specific purified  cellular mRNAs in an attempt to correlate m6A location with function.  Polyadenylylated mRNA is hybridized to cDNA clones representing the full size  mRNA under study or fragments of it, and the protected RNA is digested and  labeled with polynucleotide kinase in vitro. After enrichment for m6A with  anti-m6A antibody, the [32P]-pm6A is separated on TLC plates, and compared with  the total amount of radiolabeled nucleotides. Using this combination of in vitro  RNA labeling and antibody selection, we were able to detect m6A in purified  stable mRNAs that cannot be readily labeled in cells with greater sensitivity  than was possible by previous techniques. We applied this technique to bovine  prolactin mRNA and showed that this mRNA contains m6A. Moreover, all of the m6A  residues in this message are found within the 3' two-thirds of the molecule and  are highly concentrated (61%) within a sequence of 108 nucleotides at the 3'  noncoding region of the message. The nonrandom distribution of m6A in a specific  cellular mRNA, as demonstrated for bovine prolactin, will have to be taken into  account when designing a model for m6A function."", 'Author information: (1)Broad Institute of MIT and Harvard, Cambridge, MA 02142, USA.

After treatment with 2 and 5 mg/ml of cycloleucine, internal m6As  were reduced by 10- and 100-fold, respectively. The inhibition of BSC-1 mRNA  methylations paralleled that observed for late SV40 mRNAs. In cells exposed to 2  mg/ml cycloleucine production of late SV40 mRNA was inhibited by 80% whereas the  amount of SV40 nuclear RNA was only slightly reduced. Size fractionation of SV40  nuclear RNA from cycloleucine-treated cells revealed a loss of SV40 19 S RNA  with a corresponding increase of fragmented RNA sedimenting between 11 to 5 S,  so that the total amount of SV40 RNA in the nucleus was almost unchanged.  Analysis of viral transcription complexes from cells treated with cycloleucine  indicated that SV40 transcription was not affected by cycloleucine.  SV40-transformed cells, in contrast to BSC-1 cells, were able to process and  transport undermethylated RNA. When transformed cells were treated with 2 mg/ml  cycloleucine no changes in quantities or size of cytoplasmic and nuclear RNA  were detected. The data argues for a role of internal m6A moieties in modulating  the processing-linked transport of mRNA from the nucleus to the cytoplasm of  nontransformed cells. Transformed cells may escape these controls due to  structural alterations in their perinuclear regions."", 'It has been repeatedly shown that chronic stress changes dendrites, spines and  modulates expression of synaptic molecules. These effects all may impair  information transfer between neurons. The present study shows that chronic  stress also regulates expression of M6a, a glycoprotein which is localised in  axonal membranes. We have previously demonstrated that M6a is a component of  glutamatergic axons. The present data reveal that it is the splice variant  M6a-Ib, not M6a-Ia, which is strongly expressed in the brain. Chronic stress in  male rats (3 weeks daily restraint) has regional effects: quantitative in situ  hybridization demonstrated that M6a-Ib mRNA in dentate gyrus granule neurons and  in CA3 pyramidal neurons is downregulated, whereas M6a-Ib mRNA in the medial  prefrontal cortex is upregulated by chronic stress. This is the first study  showing that expression of an axonal membrane molecule is differentially  affected by stress in a region-dependent manner. Therefore, one may speculate  that diminished expression of the glycoprotein in the hippocampus leads to  altered output in the corresponding cortical projection areas. Enhanced M6a-Ib  expression in the medial prefrontal cortex (in areas prelimbic and infralimbic  cortex) might be interpreted as a compensatory mechanism in response to changes  in axonal projections from the hippocampus. Our findings provide evidence that  in addition to alterations in dendrites and spines chronic stress also changes  the integrity of axons and may thus impair information transfer even between  distant brain regions.', 'The methylation of internal adenosine residues in eukaryotic mRNA, forming  N6-methyladenosine (m6A), is catalyzed by a complex multicomponent enzyme.  Previous studies suggested that m6A affects the efficiency of mRNA processing or  transport, although the mechanism by which this occurs is not known. As a step  toward better understanding the mechanism and function of this ubiquitous  posttranscriptional modification, we have shown that HeLa mRNA  (N6-adenosine)-methyltransferase requires at least two separate protein factors,  MT-A and MT-B, and MT-A contains the AdoMet binding site on a 70-kDa subunit  (MT-A70). MT-A70 was purified by conventional chromatography and  electrophoresis, and was microsequenced. The peptide sequence was used to design  a degenerate oligodeoxynucleotide that in turn was used to isolate the cDNA  clone coding for MT-A70 from a HeLa cDNA library. Recombinant MT-A70 was  expressed as a fusion protein in bacteria and was used to generate anti-MT-A70  antisera in rabbits. These antisera recognize MT-A70 in HeLa nuclear extracts by  western blot and are capable of depleting (N6-adenosine)-methyltransferase  activity from HeLa nuclear extract, confirming that MT-A70 is a critical subunit  of (N6-adenosine)-methyltransferase. Northern blot analysis reveals that MT-A70  mRNA is present in a wide variety of human tissues and may undergo alternative  splicing. MT-A70 cDNA probe hybridizes to a 2.0-kilobase (kb) polyadenylated RNA  isolated from HeLa cells, whereas it hybridizes to two predominant RNA species  (approximately 2.0 kb and 3.0 kb) using mRNA isolated from six different human  tissues. Analysis of the cDNA sequence indicates that it codes for a 580-amino  acid protein with a predicted MW = 65 kDa. The predicted protein contains  sequences similar to consensus methylation motifs I and II identified in  prokaryotic DNA (N6-adenosine)-methyltransferases, suggesting the functional  conservation of peptide motifs. MT-A70 also contains a long region of homology  to the yeast protein SPO8, which is involved in induction of sporulation by an  unknown mechanism.', 'N6-methyladenosine (m6A) modification plays a critical role in mammalian  development. However, the role of m6A in the skeletal muscle development remains  largely unknown. Here, we report a global m6A modification pattern of goat  skeletal muscle at two key development stages and identified that the m6A  modification regulated the expression of the growth arrest and DNA  damage-inducible 45B (GADD45B) gene, which is\xa0involved in myogenic  differentiation. We showed that GADD45B expression increased during myoblast  differentiation, whereas the downregulation of GADD45B inhibits myogenic  differentiation and mitochondrial biogenesis. Moreover, the expression of  GADD45B regulates the expression of\xa0myogenic regulatory factors and peroxisome  proliferator-activated receptor gamma coactivator 1 alpha by activating the p38  mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) pathway. Conversely, the inactivation of  p38 MAPK abolished the GADD45B-mediated myogenic differentiation. Furthermore,  we found that the knockdown of fat mass and obesity-associated protein (FTO)  increases GADD45B m6A modification and decreases the stability of GADD45B mRNA,  which impairs myogenic differentiation. Our results indicate that the  FTO-mediated m6A modification in GADD45B mRNA drives skeletal muscle  differentiation by activating the p38 MAPK pathway, which provides a molecular  mechanism for the regulation of myogenesis via RNA methylation.', ""miRNAs and DNA methylation are both critical regulators of gene expression.  Aberration in miRNA expression or DNA methylation is a causal factor for  numerous pathological conditions. DNA methylation can inhibit the transcription  of miRNAs, just like coding genes, by methylating the CpG islands in the  promoter regions of miRNAs. Conversely, certain miRNAs can directly target DNA  methyltransferases and bring about their inhibition, thereby affecting the whole  genome methylation pattern. Recently, methylation patterns have also been  revealed in mRNA. Surprisingly, the two most commonly studied methylation states  in mRNA (m6A and m5C) are found to be enriched in 3'-UTRs (untranslated  regions), the target site for the majority of miRNAs. Whereas m5C is reported to  stabilise mRNA, m6A has a destabilising effect on mRNA. However, the effect of  mRNA methylation on its interaction with miRNAs is largely unexplored. The  review highlights the complex interplay between microRNA and methylation at DNA  and mRNA level."", 'Methyltranscriptome is an exciting new area that studies the mechanisms and  functions of methylation in transcripts.

It includes  a database that records publicaly available data sets from methylated RNA  immunoprecipitation sequencing (MeRIP-Seq), a recently developed technology for  interrogating m(6)A methyltranscriptome.

The most canonical AAUAAA hexamer and its 11 single-nucleotide variants  that are most frequent in human genes were used to search for polyadenylation  signals in the terminal sequences. Out of 18,277 poly(A) sites that were  identified from 26,414 human genes, 82.5% of the sites were found to contain at  least one of these 12 hexamers as a polyadenylation signal within 40 nucleotides  upstream of the poly(A) site. The rest (17.5%) did not contain any of these  hexamers, which suggests the existence of yet unknown signals. A total of 20,347  terminal sequences in close proximity to 12 polyadenylation signals were  collected using modified EST clustering technique to establish a large-scale  database of polyadenylation signals. To characterize the 12 hexamers, the  locations of polyadenylation signals that were identified as ""authentic"" and the  uracil contents of the downstream region of the signal were examined. Based on  this analysis, the 11 variants of the canonical AAUAAA were identified as  possibly forming ""functional"" signals as AAUAAA. Moreover, the observed  frequency of 41.9% for AAUAAA was significantly lower than those of other  reports, suggesting that the non-canonical variants are more important in the  polyadenylation process than frequently recognized. Since the poly(A) sites  processed by those non-canonical variants have not been generally annotated in  major gene databases, it is important to determine whether the variant hexamers  could work as polyadenylation signals that may be responsible for generating  heterogeneity of mRNAs by alternative polyadenylation.', 'Polymorphism of the FTO gene encoding an N(6)-methyladenosine (m(6)A) RNA  demethylase was robustly associated with human obesity; however, the mechanism  by which FTO affects metabolism, considering its emerging role in RNA  modification, is still poorly understood.

58,Is arimoclomol a co-inducer of the heat shock response?,"['Amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) is a progressive neurodegenerative disorder  characterized by motoneuron degeneration, resulting in muscle paralysis and  death, typically within 1-5 years of diagnosis. Although the pathogenesis of ALS  remains unclear, there is evidence for the involvement of proteasome dysfunction  and heat shock proteins in the disease. We have previously shown that treatment  with a co-inducer of the heat shock response called arimoclomol is effective in  the SOD(G93A) mouse model of ALS, delaying disease progression and extending the  lifespan of SOD(G93A) mice (Kieran et al. 2004). However, this previous study  only examined the effects arimoclomol when treatment was initiated in pre- or  early symptomatic stages of the disease. Clearly, to be of benefit to the  majority of ALS patients, any therapy must be effective after symptom onset. In  order to establish whether post-symptomatic treatment with arimoclomol is  effective, in this study we carried out a systematic assessment of different  treatment regimes in SOD(G93A) mice. Treatment with arimoclomol from early (75  days) or late (90 days) symptomatic stages significantly improved muscle  function. Treatment from 75 days also significantly increased the lifespan of  SOD(G93A) mice, although treatment from 90 days has no significant effect on  lifespan. The mechanism of action of arimoclomol involves potentiation of the  heat shock response, and treatment with arimoclomol increased Hsp70 expression.  Interestingly, this up-regulation in Hsp70 was accompanied by a decrease in the  number of ubiquitin-positive aggregates in the spinal cord of treated SOD(G93A)  mice, suggesting that arimoclomol directly effects protein aggregation and  degradation.', 'Retinitis pigmentosa (RP) is a group of inherited diseases that cause blindness  due to the progressive death of rod and cone photoreceptors in the retina. There  are currently no effective treatments for RP. Inherited mutations in rhodopsin,  the light-sensing protein of rod photoreceptor cells, are the most common cause  of autosomal-dominant RP. The majority of mutations in rhodopsin, including the  common P23H substitution, lead to protein misfolding, which is a feature in many  neurodegenerative disorders. Previous studies have shown that upregulating  molecular chaperone expression can delay disease progression in models of  neurodegeneration. Here, we have explored the potential of the heat-shock  protein co-inducer arimoclomol to ameliorate rhodopsin RP. In a cell model of  P23H rod opsin RP, arimoclomol reduced P23H rod opsin aggregation and improved  viability of mutant rhodopsin-expressing cells. In P23H rhodopsin transgenic rat  models, pharmacological potentiation of the stress response with arimoclomol  improved electroretinogram responses and prolonged photoreceptor survival, as  assessed by measuring outer nuclear layer thickness in the retina. Furthermore,  treated animal retinae showed improved photoreceptor outer segment structure and  reduced rhodopsin aggregation compared with vehicle-treated controls. The  heat-shock response (HSR) was activated in P23H retinae, and this was enhanced  with arimoclomol treatment. Furthermore, the unfolded protein response (UPR),  which is induced in P23H transgenic rats, was also enhanced in the retinae of  arimoclomol-treated animals, suggesting that arimoclomol can potentiate the UPR  as well as the HSR. These data suggest that pharmacological enhancement of  cellular stress responses may be a potential treatment for rhodopsin RP and that  arimoclomol could benefit diseases where ER stress is a factor.', 'Arimoclomol is an investigational drug for amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS)  that amplifies heat shock protein gene expression during cell stress. The  objectives of the present study were to assess the safety, tolerability, and  pharmacokinetics of arimoclomol in ALS. Eighty-four participants with ALS  received arimoclomol at one of three oral doses (25, 50, or 100 mg three times  daily) or placebo. The primary outcome measure was safety and tolerability. A  subset of 44 participants provided serum and cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) samples  for pharmacokinetic analysis. Participants who completed 12 weeks of treatment  could enroll in a 6-month open-label study. Arimoclomol at doses up to 300  mg/day was well tolerated and safe. Arimoclomol resulted in dose-linear  pharmacologic exposures and the half-life did not change with continued  treatment. Arimoclomol CSF levels increased with dose. Arimoclomol was shown to  be safe, and it crosses the blood-brain barrier. Serum pharmacokinetic profiles  support dosing of three times per day. An efficacy study in ALS is planned.', 'Arimoclomol, an amplifier of heat shock protein expression involved in cellular  stress response, has emerged as a potential therapeutic candidate in amyotrophic  lateral sclerosis (ALS) in recent years. Treatment with arimoclomol was reported  to improve survival and muscle function in a mouse model of motor neuron  disease. Several single- and multiple-dose safety studies have been completed in  healthy control subjects. A 3-month Phase IIa study in people with ALS  demonstrated safety at dosages up to 300 mg/day and another study is currently  recruiting participants with familial ALS caused by mutations in the superoxide  dismutase gene. We review the rationale for testing arimoclomol in sporadic and  familial ALS in the context of available safety and pharmacokinetic data.  Published and unpublished literature relative to the drug in the past two  decades is discussed. The current review attempts to bring together our existing  understanding of the actions of arimoclomol with the disease profile of ALS. The  pharmacological profile of arimoclomol and the available preclinical data make  it a promising therapeutic possibility in ALS.', 'Manipulation of the cellular stress response offers strategies to protect brain  cells from damage induced by ischemia and neurodegenerative diseases.  Overexpression of Hsp70 reduced ischemic injury in the mammalian brain.  Investigation of the domains within Hsp70 that confers ischemic neuroprotection  revealed the importance of the carboxyl-terminal domain. Arimoclomol, a  coinducer of heat shock proteins, delayed progression of amyotrophic lateral  sclerosis (ALS) in a mouse model in which motor neurons in the spinal cord and  motor cortex degenerate. Celastrol, a promising candidate as an agent to counter  neurodegenerative diseases, induced expression of a set of Hsps in  differentiated neurons grown in tissue culture. Heat shock ""preconditioning""  protected the nervous system at the functional level of the synapse and  selective overexpression of Hsp70 enhanced the level of synaptic protection.  Following hyperthermia, constitutively expressed Hsc70 increased in synapse-rich  areas of the brain where it associates with Hsp40 to form a complex that can  refold denatured proteins. Stress tolerance in neurons is not solely dependent  on their own Hsps but can be supplemented by Hsps from adjacent glial cells.  Hence, application of exogenous Hsps at neural injury sites is an effective  strategy to maintain neuronal viability.', '1. The effects of SR 33589 and amiodarone on the cardiac beta-adrenoceptor were  studied in vitro and after chronic treatment by means of  [125I]-(-)-iodocyanopindolol ([125I]-(-)-CYP) binding and measurement of  adenylate cyclase activity. 2. Binding of [125I]-(-)-CYP was inhibited in a  dose-dependent manner by SR 33589 (IC50=1.8 +/- 0.4 microM, nH=0.93 +/- 0.06)  and amiodarone (IC50=8.7 +/- 2.0 microM, nH=9.2 +/- 0.03). Saturation binding  experiments indicated a non-competitive interaction such that SR 33589 (1 and 3  microM) and amiodarone (5 and 10 microM) reduced the Bmax of [125I]-(-)-CYP  binding without any effect on the KD. Kinetic studies showed that the rate of  association of [125I]-(-)-CYP was unchanged while the rate of dissociation was  increased both in the presence of SR 33589 (10 microM) and amiodarone (30  microM).3. Under the same conditions, the receptor stimulated adenylate cyclase  activity was inhibited in a dose-dependent, but non-competitive manner, by SR  33589 (isoprenaline-, glucagon- and secretin-stimulated enzyme inhibited 50% at  6.8 +/- 0.6 microM, 31 +/- 10 microM and 12 +/- 3 microM, respectively) while  the basal, GTP- and GPP(NH)p-stimulated enzyme was inhibited by 5-10% and the  NaF and forskolin-stimulated enzyme by 50% at 500 microM. Amiodarone exhibited a  similar pattern of inhibition. 4. After chronic oral treatment (50, 100, 150 mg  kg(-1) per day, 14 days), both SR 33589 and amiodarone produced a dose-dependent  decrease in Bmax without any effect on KD as determined from [125I]-(-)-CYP  saturation experiments and a decrease of the isoprenaline- and  glucagon-stimulated adenylate cyclase activity without any effect on basal  enzyme activity or activity when stimulated by agents acting directly on  regulatory catalytic units. 5. Unlike amiodarone, SR 33589 does not contain  iodine substituents. Plasma levels of T3, T4, and rT3 were changed after SR  33589 treatment except a decrease in T4 level at the highest dose whilst the T4  T3 ratio and the level of rT3 were dose-dependently increased by amiodarone  treatment. 6. In vitro, SR 33589 and amiodarone were characterized as  non-competitive beta-adrenoceptor antagonists. Chronic treatment led to a  down-regulation of the beta-adrenoceptor; the down-regulation cannot be  attributed to an indirect effect mediated by the thyroid hormones. To reconcile  these opposing observations, we propose that SR 33589 and amiodarone interact  with the beta-adrenoceptor at a site close to the intracellular loops which are  involved in the coupling with Gs and contain the phosphorylable sites.', 'We undertook a longitudinal study of the histological and biochemical changes at  the neuromuscular junction (NMJ) in muscles of SOD1-G93A mice. We also assessed  these functions in mice treated with a known heat shock protein inducer,  arimoclomol. Tissue samples of treated and untreated mSOD mice were analysed for  AChE and ChAT enzyme activities as markers of neuromuscular function. Sections  of hindlimb muscles (TA, EDL and soleus) were also stained for succinate  dehydrogenase and silver cholinesterase activities as well as for  immunohistochemistry. Hsp70 levels were also measured from muscle samples using  ELISA. Results showed that denervation and nerve sprouting were present at  symptom onset in fast muscles, although slow muscles remained fully innervated.  Cholinergic enzyme activities were reduced prior to denervation and declined  further with disease progression. Reduction of endplate size, a slow to fast  shift in muscle phenotype was also observed. Treatment with arimoclomol delayed  the appearance of these changes, increased innervation, cholinergic enzyme  activities and endplate size and reversed muscle fibre transformation. These  beneficial effects of arimoclomol in muscles were accompanied by an increase in  Hsp70 expression. In conclusion, our results indicate that pharmacological  targeting of muscles at early stages of disease may be a successful strategy to  ameliorate disease progression in ALS.', 'The field of non-coding RNA (ncRNA) has expanded over the last decade following  the discoveries of several new classes of regulatory ncRNA. A growing amount of  evidence now indicates that ncRNAs are involved even in the most fundamental of  cellular processes. The heat shock response is no exception as ncRNAs are being  identified as integral components of this process. Although this area of  research is only in its infancy, this article focuses on several classes of  regulatory ncRNA (i.e., miRNA, lncRNA, and circRNA), while summarizing their  activities in mammalian heat shock. We also present an updated model integrating  the traditional heat shock response with the activities of regulatory ncRNA. Our  model expands on the mechanisms for efficient execution of the stress response,  while offering a more comprehensive summary of the major regulators and  responders in heat shock signaling. It is our hope that much of what is  discussed herein may help researchers in integrating the fields of heat shock  and ncRNA in mammals.', 'Sinodielide A (SA) is a naturally occurring guaianolide, which is isolated from  the root of Sinodielsia yunnanensis. This root, commonly found in Yunnan  province, is used in traditional Chinese medicine as an antipyretic, analgesic  and diaphoretic agent. A number of studies have reported that agents isolated  from a species of Umbelliferae (Apiaceae) have antitumor activities. We  previously reported, using combined treatments with this medicinal herb and  hyperthermia at various temperatures, an enhanced cytotoxicity in the human  prostate cancer androgen‑independent cell lines, PC3 and DU145, and analyzed the  related mechanisms. In the present study, we investigated the effects of  treatment with SA prior to hyperthermia on the thermosensitivity of DU145 cells,  and the mechanisms related to the induction of apoptosis and G(2)/M cell cycle  arrest via the activation of extracellular-regulated kinase (ERK)1/2, c-Jun  N-terminal kinase (JNK) mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) signaling  pathways, as well as the phosphoinositide 3-kinase (PI3K)/Akt signaling  pathways. Cells were exposed to hyperthermia alone (40-44˚C) or hyperthermia in  combination with SA. Lethal damage to cells treated with mild hyperthermia (40  or 42˚C) for up to 6 h was slight; however, hyperthermia in combination with SA  synergistically enhanced thermosensivity. Lethal damage to cells treated with  acute hyperthermia (43 or 44˚C) was more severe, but these effects were also  enhanced and were more significant by the combined treatment with SA. The  kinetics of apoptosis induction and cell cycle distribution were analyzed by  flow cytometry. In addition, the levels of ERK1/2, JNK and Akt were determined  by western blot analysis. The incidence of apoptotic cells after treatment with  SA (20.0 µM) at 37˚C for 4 h, hyperthermia (44˚C) alone for 30 min, and the  combination in sequence were examined. The sub-G1 division (%) in the diagram  obtained by flow cytometry was applied to that assay. The percentage of  apoptotic cells (10.53±5.02%) was higher at 48 h as compared to 0, 12 and 24 h  after treatment. The distribution of DU145 cells in the G2/M cell cycle phase  was markedly increased after 24 h of heating at 44˚C and after the combined  treatment with heating and SA. The phosphorylation of ERK1/2 was reduced  following treatment with heating and SA, while the levels of phosphorylated JNK  (p-JNK) were markedly increased immediately after heating at 44˚C and when  heating was combined with SA. By contrast, the levels of phosphorylated Akt  (p-Akt) were immediately increased only after heating at 44˚C. Thus, we  concluded that SA exerts its thermosensitizing effects on DU145 cells by  inhibiting the activation of the MAPK/ERK1/2 and PI3K/Akt signaling pathways.', 'Lysosomal storage diseases (LSDs) often manifest with severe systemic and  central nervous system (CNS) symptoms. The existing treatment options are  limited and have no or only modest efficacy against neurological manifestations  of disease. We demonstrate that recombinant human heat shock protein 70 (HSP70)  improves the binding of several sphingolipid-degrading enzymes to their  essential cofactor bis(monoacyl)glycerophosphate in vitro. HSP70 treatment  reversed lysosomal pathology in primary fibroblasts from 14 patients with eight  different LSDs. HSP70 penetrated effectively into murine tissues including the  CNS and inhibited glycosphingolipid accumulation in murine models of Fabry  disease (Gla(-/-)), Sandhoff disease (Hexb(-/-)), and Niemann-Pick disease type  C (Npc1(-/-)) and attenuated a wide spectrum of disease-associated neurological  symptoms in Hexb(-/-) and Npc1(-/-) mice. Oral administration of arimoclomol, a  small-molecule coinducer of HSPs that is currently in clinical trials for  Niemann-Pick disease type C (NPC), recapitulated the effects of recombinant  human HSP70, suggesting that heat shock protein-based therapies merit clinical  evaluation for treating LSDs.']","Yes, arimoclomol is a hydroxylamine derivative, a group of compounds which have unique properties as co-inducers of heat shock protein expression, but only under conditions of cellular stress."
59,What is 2d 4d ratio in athletes.,"['BACKGROUND: To determine the 2D:4D ratio in elite Indian male kabaddi players  and compare them with non-athletes. OBJECTIVES: Our study was undertaken to find out a possible relation between  digit ratio and sporting ability of male kabaddi players. This study also gives  an insight into the possible ethnic differences between Indian sports personnel  and other populations. PATIENTS AND METHODS: Both right and left hands of 33 male kabaddi players  attending training camp at the Bangalore regional centre of Sports Authority of  India were scanned. Lengths of second and fourth digits were measured and their  ratio calculated. Age, weight, height and body mass index matched subjects (25  males) who did not participate in any sports formed the control group. RESULTS: A highly significant difference was found in 2D:4D ratios of both the  hands with Kabaddi players having a lower ratio compared to their controls.  There was no statistically significant difference in 2D:4D (Δ r-l) between  Kabaddi players and controls. CONCLUSIONS: Kabaddi is an intermediate sport not requiring a high level of  endurance but at the same time requires masculine traits because of combating  nature of the game. 2D:4D ratios can be used as reliable additional criteria  when screening for prospective players to be inducted into the team.', 'Research particularly focusing on male athletes and popular sports (running and  soccer) suggests associations of lower (masculinized) second-to-fourth digit  ratio (2D:4D), a putative marker of prenatal androgen action, with better sports  performance. Studies focusing on women, non-mainstream sports, or controlling  for covariates relevant for sporting success are still sparse. This study  examined associations between 2D:4D and performance of both male and female  athletes active in fencing (a non-mainstream sport dominated by male  participants), while controlling for covariates. National fencing rankings and  2D:4D of 58 male and 41 female Austrian tournament fencers (mean age 24 years)  were correlated. Among female, but not male, fencers, lower 2D:4D was related to  better national fencing rankings. 2D:4D still accounted for incremental variance  (12%) in fencing success, when the effects of salient performance factors (age,  body mass index, years of fencing, training intensity, and the personality  variables achievement, control, harm avoidance, and social potency) were  controlled for (totaling 35% attributable variance). Athletes active in the most  aggressive form (the sabre) had lower 2D:4D than those active in the other forms  (épée and foil fencing). Sporting success in adult life might be partly  prenatally programmed via long-lasting extragenital effects of testosterone.', ""BACKGROUND: Ratio of second and fourth digit (2D:4D) is known to be germane in  analyzing utero concentrations of testosterone and estrogen in human and other  vertebrates. 2D:4D had been linked to several traits like athletes' abilities,  reproductive success, risk of cancer and cardiovascular disease (CVD). Metabolic  syndrome (MetS) is a clustering of several cardiovascular risk factors. Waist  circumference (WC), neck circumference (NC), body mass index (BMI) and  waist-to-height ratio (WHtR) are important in measuring MetS. This study  investigated sexual dimorphism in 2D:4D and its relationship with MetS indices  and CVD factors among adult residing in Ilorin, North central Nigeria. MATERIALS AND METHODS: This is a cross-sectional, stratified multi-staged  sampling study. Participants residing in different neighborhoods were visited at  home where finger lengths and anthropometric traits were measured. Participants  include 801 healthy adults aged 18-44 years (56% male) who had been living in  the area for more than 3 years. RESULTS: Males showed significantly lower 2D:4D than females (unpaired t-test; t  [699] = 11.49, P = 0.001). A significant positive correlation was observed in  MetS markers and 2D:4D. WHtR showed the highest correlation with 2D:4D in male  (r = 0.461, P ≤ 0.001) and female (r = 0.408, P ≤ 0.001) when compared with BMI,  NC and WC. All positive correlations recorded in this study were high in male  and right hand. CONCLUSION: Our results showed that 2D:4D is sexual dimorphic and right hand  2D:4D as a predictor of MetS is better. We concluded that 2D:4D is a proxy for  MetS and CVD risk factors in Ilorin."", ""The relative length of the second and fourth digits (2D:4D) is a putative marker  for prenatal testosterone. Low 2D:4D has been reported to correlate with high  performance in sport in general. Here, for the first time, we examine the  relationship between 2D:4D and performance in elite rugby players. The 44  players (28 forwards, 16 backs) were drawn from the Ospreys Rugby Union Club and  44 age-matched controls. The measures of performance comprised age-adjusted  number of international performances (caps) for Wales, a comparison of coaches'  first-choice League team with others, and the number of tries scored by backs in  club matches. Compared with controls, players were larger and had lower 2D:4D  for the right and left hand. With regard to number of caps, players with low  2D:4D in their right hand and low right 2D:4D compared with their left  (right\xa0-\xa0left 2D:4D difference) had high numbers of caps. First-choice players  did not differ significantly from second-choice players in their 2D:4D but they  did have a lower right\xa0-\xa0left 2D:4D difference than second-choice players. Low  right 2D:4D and low right\xa0-\xa0left 2D:4D difference were significantly linked with  large numbers of tries. We conclude that low right 2D:4D and low right\xa0-\xa0left  2D:4D difference are predictors of high rugby performance."", ""The relative length of the second and fourth digits (2D:4D) is thought to be  negatively related to prenatal testosterone and positively related to prenatal  estrogen. Low 2D:4D has been linked to various measures of performance in a  range of sports (e.g., soccer, rugby). In this study, we consider the  relationship between 2D:4D and performance among male surfers. Our sample  comprised 46 competitors in the Men's 5-star Professional World Qualifying  Series surfing competition in Newquay, United Kingdom, in 2009. Three  experienced surfing coaches rated the participants for overall surfing ability.  The coach's ratings were significantly correlated with one another and an  overall measure of surfing performance was obtained by calculating the mean of  the 3 ratings. In addition, the final placing of the Newquay competition was  used as an additional performance measure. Mean 2D:4D (SD) was as follows: right  0.994 (0.023) and left 0.976 (0.028). We found that right 2D:4D (but not left  2D:4D or right-left 2D:4D) was significantly negatively correlated with coaches'  ratings (r(s) = 0.58) and the competition result (r(s) = 0.30). It appears that  in line with other sports that low right 2D:4D (high prenatal testosterone and  low prenatal estrogen) correlates to high surfing ability in men."", 'OBJECTIVES: Digit ratio, especially second-to-fourth digit ratio (2D:4D) is  established in utero and is positively correlated with oestrogen in men and  women. It is a putative biomarker for prenatal hormone exposure and may  represent an individual predisposition to certain diseases (e.g., breast  cancer). The aim of the present study is to investigate whether there is a link  between digit ratio (2D:4D) and breast cancer in Chinese populations. METHODS: The controls we chose were healthy subjects-age and -sex matched to the  patients diagnosed with breast cancer. Photocopies of the two hands of 218 women  (controls: 109; patients: 109) were collected. Left hand, right hand, mean hand,  and right minus left 2D:4D (Dr-l ) were analyzed. RESULTS: The patients with breast cancer presented significantly higher 2D:4D  than controls (left: P < 0.01; right: P < 0.05; mean: P < 0.05). The mean values  of 2D:4D on the left hand were significantly higher than those on the right hand  in the two groups, respectively (controls: P < 0.05; patients: P ≤ 0.01). In  patients, there was a significantly negative correlation between 2D:4D (left  hand: P < 0.01; right hand, mean: P < 0.05) and the presented age with breast  cancer, but no association between Dr-l and age of presented disease. CONCLUSIONS: Digit ratio (2D:4D) may correlate with the increased risk of breast  cancer.', 'Reliable data are scanty on the incidence of chronic diseases and life  expectancy (LE) of highly trained athletes. We therefore studied Finnish male  world class athletes to estimate the LE of athletes. Finnish team members in the  Olympic games, World or European championships or intercountry competitions  during 1920-1965 in track and field athletics, cross-country skiing, soccer, ice  hockey, basketball, boxing, wrestling, weight lifting, and shooting were  included (N = 2613 men). The reference cohort, 1712 men, was selected from the  Finnish Defence Forces conscription register matched on age and area of  residence. All referents were classified completely healthy at the time of  induction to military service. The stratified Kaplan-Meier product limit method  and the Cox proportional hazards model were used to estimate the life  expectancies and the mortality odds ratios (OR) and their confidence limits. The  mean LE adjusted for occupational group, marital status, and the age at entry to  the cohort (and its 95% confidence limits) was in endurance sports (long  distance running and cross-country skiing) 75.6 (73.6, 77.5) yr; in team games  (soccer, ice hockey, basketball, as well as jumpers and short-distance runners  from track and field (73.9 (72.7, 75.1) yr; in power sports (boxing, wrestling,  weight lifting, and throwers from field athletics) 71.5 (70.4, 72.2) yr; and in  the reference group 69.9 (69.0, 70.9) yr. The increased mean life expectancies  were mainly explained by decreased cardiovascular mortality (endurance sports  mortality odds ratio OR = 0.49 (95% CL 0.26, 0.93), team sports OR = 0.61 (0.41,  0.92) compared with referents). For maximum life span no differences between the  groups were observed.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)', ""OBJECTIVES: Athlete's heart represents a structural and functional adaptation to  regular endurance exercise. BACKGROUND: While left ventricular (LV) hypertrophy of the athlete's heart has  been examined in many studies, the extent of right ventricular (RV) hypertrophy  is still uncertain because of its complex shape and trabecular structure. To  examine RV hypertrophy, we used magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) and  hypothesized that athlete's heart is characterized by similar LV and RV  hypertrophy. METHODS: The LV and RV mass, volume, and function in 21 male endurance athletes  (A) (27 +/- 4 years; 70 +/- 8 kg; 178 +/- 7 cm; maximal oxygen uptake  [VO(2)max]: 68 +/- 5 ml/min per kg) and 21 pair-matched untrained control  subjects (C) (26 +/- 3 years; 71 +/- 9 kg; 178 +/- 6 cm; VO(2)max: 42 +/- 6  ml/min per kg) were analyzed by MRI (Magnetom Vision 1.5T, Siemens, Erlangen,  Germany). RESULTS: Left ventricular masses: (A: 200 +/- 20 g; C: 148 +/- 17 g) and RV  masses (A: 77 +/- 10 g; C: 56 +/- 8 g) differed significantly between the groups  (p < 0.001). The LV and RV end-diastolic volumes (EDV) (LV-EDV 167 +/- 28 ml  [A]; 125 +/- 16 ml [C]; RV-EDV 160 +/- 26 ml [A]; 128 +/- 10 ml [C]), and stroke  volumes (SV) (LV-SV: 99 +/- 18 ml [A], 74 +/- 11 ml [C]; RV-SV: 102 +/- 18 ml  [A], 79 +/- 8 ml [C]) were significantly different between the athletes and  control subjects (p < 0.001), whereas ejection fractions (EF) (LV-EF: 59 +/- 3%  [A]; 59 +/- 6% [C]; RV-EF: 63 +/- 3% [A], 62 +/- 3% [C]) and LV-to-RV ratios  were similar for both groups (LV-to-RV mass: 2.6 +/- 0.2 [A], 2.6 +/- 0.3 [C];  LV-to-RV EDV: 1.05 +/- 0.14 [A], 0.99 +/- 0.14 [C]; LV-to-RV SV: 0.98 +/- 0.17  [A], 0.95 +/- 0.17 [C]; LV-to-RV EF: 0.93 +/- 0.07 [A], 0.96 +/- 0.10 [C]). CONCLUSIONS: Regular and extensive endurance training results in similar changes  in LV and RV mass, volume, and function in endurance athletes. This leads to the  conclusion that the athlete's heart is a balanced enlarged heart."", '""Athlete\'s heart"" is characterized by an increase in ventricular chamber sizes  and myocardial mass (MM), and is mainly observed in endurance athletes. At  present, it remains unclear whether cardiac adaptations in long-distance runners  differ from those in triathletes. Twenty male triathletes (mean age 38.7 ± 6.2  years) and 20 male marathon runners (mean age 44.1 ± 7.9) underwent cardiac  magnetic resonance imaging to calculate left and right ventricular end-diastolic  volume (EDV), end-systolic volume (ESV), stroke volume (SV), ejection fraction  (EF), and MM. Late-enhancement (LE) imaging was used to exclude structural  alterations or myocardial scarring. EDV, ESV, SV, and EF for the left and right  ventricles, as well as MM, did not differ between long-distance runners and  triathletes, although the weekly training volume was significantly higher in  triathletes (17.05 vs 9.95 h/week, P < 0.0001). There was a significant  correlation between weekly training volume and right and left EDV, right and  left ESV as well as MM within the study group. Myocardial LE was absent in all  athletes. Highly trained male long-distance runners and triathletes have  comparable cardiac parameters. However, the extent of physical training seems to  be associated with the degree of cardiac adaptation in endurance athletes. The  absence of LE supports the idea that athlete\'s heart is a nonpathological  adaptation of the cardiovascular system.', 'Congenital adrenal hyperplasia (CAH) due to 21-hydroxylase deficiency results in  excessive androgen exposure in the gestational period and various degrees of  masculinization of the external genitalia in female foetuses. Intrauterine  gonadal steroids are not only essential for the development of the genital  organs but also affect some other extragenital organ development. The second to  fourth digit (2D/4D) ratio shows a sexually dimorphic pattern with longer fourth  digit from second digit in men compared to women. A low 2D/4D ratio is  associated with high sperm count, testosterone levels and reproductive success  in men. A high 2D/4D ratio is associated with high oestrogen levels in women.  Second and fourth digit ratio has also found to be correlated with sexual  orientation, left hand preference autism and some adult onset diseases such as  breast cancer and myocardial infarction. We found lower 2D/4D ratio in female  patients with 21-hydroxylase deficiency compared to healthy girls (p=0.000) and  equal 2D/4D ratio for female patients when compared to male controls. Male  patients with 21-hydroxylase deficiency had significantly lower 2D/4D ratio than  female and male controls in the right hand. Healthy boys had lower 2D/4D ratio  than healthy girls. It is concluded that 2D/4D ratio established by intrauterine  androgen levels influences the sexually dimorphic digit pattern.']","Lower 2D:4D ratio was reported to be lower in handball players,  kabaddi players, varsity athletes, football players, soccer players and rugby players. Low 2D:4D ratio correlates with better performance and with enhanced sporting prowess, particularly with regard to activities requiring endurance and dependent upon slow-twitch muscles."
60,Which is the substrate of the haspin kinase during mitosis?,"['Haspin/Gsg2 is a kinase that phosphorylates histone H3 at Thr-3 (H3T3ph) during  mitosis. Its depletion by RNA interference results in failure of chromosome  alignment and a block in mitosis. Haspin, therefore, is a novel target for  development of antimitotic agents. We report the development of a  high-throughput time-resolved fluorescence resonance energy transfer (TR-FRET)  kinase assay for haspin. Histone H3 peptide was used as a substrate, and a  europium-labeled H3T3ph phosphospecific monoclonal antibody was used to detect  phosphorylation. A library of 137632 small molecules was screened at K(m)  concentrations of ATP and peptide to allow identification of diverse inhibitor  types. Reconfirmation of hits and IC( 50) determinations were carried out with  the TR-FRET assay and by a radiometric assay using recombinant histone H3 as the  substrate. A preliminary assessment of specificity was made by testing  inhibition of 2 unrelated kinases. EC( 50) values in cells were determined using  a cell-based ELISA of H3T3ph. Five compounds were selected as leads based on  potency and chemical structure considerations. These leads form the basis for  the development of specific inhibitors of haspin that will have clear utility in  basic research and possible use as starting points for development of  antimitotic anticancer therapeutics.', 'Successful partitioning of chromosomes in mitosis relies on the bipolar  attachment of sister chromatids at metaphase. For this biorientation, the  chromosomal passenger complex (CPC), composed of catalytic kinase Aurora B and  regulatory components (INCENP, Survivin, and Borealin), must be localized at the  center of paired kinetochores, the site called the inner centromere. It is  largely unknown what defines the inner centromere and how the CPC is targeted to  this site. Recent studies point out that the shugoshin protein (SGO), originally  identified as a cohesin protector, also acts as a conserved centromeric adapter  of the CPC. Phosphorylation of the CPC by Cdk1 promotes direct binding with  shugoshin, thus explaining how the CPC is targeted to the centromere in a timely  manner at prometaphase during the cell cycle. Moreover, the phosphorylation of  histone H3 threonine 3 (H3-pT3) mediated by Haspin cooperates with Bub1-mediated  H2A-S121 phosphorylation in targeting the CPC to the inner centromere. H3-pT3  promotes nucleosome binding of Survivin, whereas H2A-pS121 facilitates the  binding of shugoshin. Haspin colocalizes with cohesin by associating with Pds5,  a cohesin-binding protein, and Bub1 localizes at kinetochores. Thus, the inner  centromere is defined by the spatial intersection of two histone marks mediated  by cohesin- and kinetochore-associated kinases.', 'Aurora B is a component of the chromosomal passenger complex (CPC) required for  correct spindle-kinetochore attachments during chromosome segregation and for  cytokinesis. The chromatin factors that recruit the CPC to centromeres are  unknown, however. Here we show that phosphorylation of histone H3 threonine 3  (H3T3ph) by Haspin is necessary for CPC accumulation at centromeres and that the  CPC subunit Survivin binds directly to H3T3ph. A nonbinding Survivin-D70A/D71A  mutant does not support centromeric CPC concentration, and both Haspin depletion  and Survivin-D70A/D71A mutation diminish centromere localization of the kinesin  MCAK and the mitotic checkpoint response to taxol. Survivin-D70A/D71A mutation  and microinjection of H3T3ph-specific antibody both compromise centromeric  Aurora B functions but do not prevent cytokinesis. Therefore, H3T3ph generated  by Haspin positions the CPC at centromeres to regulate selected targets of  Aurora B during mitosis.', 'The mitosis-specific phosphorylation of histone H3 at Thr3 (H3T3ph) plays an  important role in chromosome segregation by recruiting Aurora B. H3T3  phosphorylation is catalyzed by Haspin, an atypical protein kinase whose kinase  domain is intrinsically active without phosphorylation at the activation loop.  Here, we report the molecular basis for Haspin inhibition during interphase and  its reactivation in M phase. We identify a conserved basic segment that  autoinhibits Haspin during interphase. This autoinhibition is neutralized when  Cdk1 phosphorylates the N terminus of Haspin in order to recruit Polo-like  kinase (Plk1/Plx1), which, in turn, further phosphorylates multiple sites at the  Haspin N terminus. Although Plx1, and not Aurora B, is critical for H3T3  phosphorylation in Xenopus egg extracts, Plk1 and Aurora B both promote this  modification in human cells. Thus, M phase-specific H3T3 phosphorylation is  governed by the combinatorial action of mitotic kinases that neutralizes Haspin  autoinhibition through a mechanism dependent on multisite phosphorylation.', 'A hallmark of mitosis is the appearance of high levels of histone  phosphorylation, yet the roles of these modifications remain largely unknown.  Here, we demonstrate that histone H3 phosphorylated at threonine 3 is directly  recognized by an evolutionarily conserved binding pocket in the BIR domain of  Survivin, which is a member of the chromosomal passenger complex (CPC). This  binding mediates recruitment of the CPC to chromosomes and the resulting  activation of its kinase subunit Aurora B. Consistently, modulation of the  kinase activity of Haspin, which phosphorylates H3T3, leads to defects in the  Aurora B-dependent processes of spindle assembly and inhibition of nuclear  reformation. These findings establish a direct cellular role for mitotic histone  H3T3 phosphorylation, which is read and translated by the CPC to ensure accurate  cell division.', 'The approval of histone deacetylase inhibitors for treatment of lymphoma  subtypes has positioned histone modifications as potential targets for the  development of new classes of anticancer drugs. Histones also undergo  phosphorylation events, and Haspin is a protein kinase the only known target of  which is phosphorylation of histone H3 at Thr3 residue (H3T3ph), which is  necessary for mitosis progression. Mitotic kinases can be blocked by small drugs  and several clinical trials are underway with these agents. As occurs with  Aurora kinase inhibitors, Haspin might be an optimal candidate for the  pharmacological development of these compounds. A high-throughput screening for  Haspin inhibitors identified the CHR-6494 compound as being one promising such  agent. We demonstrate that CHR-6494 reduces H3T3ph levels in a dose-dependent  manner and causes a mitotic catastrophe characterized by metaphase misalignment,  spindle abnormalities and centrosome amplification. From the cellular  standpoint, the identified small-molecule Haspin inhibitor causes arrest in G2/M  and subsequently apoptosis. Importantly, ex vivo assays also demonstrate its  anti-angiogenetic features; in vivo, it shows antitumor potential in xenografted  nude mice without any observed toxicity. Thus, CHR-6494 is a first-in-class  Haspin inhibitor with a wide spectrum of anticancer effects that merits further  preclinical research as a new member of the family of mitotic kinase inhibitors.', 'Aurora B is a component of the chromosomal passenger complex (CPC) required for  correct spindle-kinetochore attachments during chromosome segregation and for  cytokinesis.

Survivin-D70A/D71A mutation  and microinjection of H3T3ph-specific antibody both compromise centromeric  Aurora B functions but do not prevent cytokinesis. Therefore, H3T3ph generated  by Haspin positions the CPC at centromeres to regulate selected targets of  Aurora B during mitosis.', 'Haspin is a serine/threonine kinase that phosphorylates Thr-3 of histone H3 in  mitosis that has emerged as a possible cancer therapeutic target. High  throughput screening of approximately 140,000 compounds identified the  beta-carbolines harmine and harmol as moderately potent haspin kinase  inhibitors. Based on information obtained from a structure-activity relationship  study previously conducted for an acridine series of haspin inhibitors in  conjunction with in silico docking using a recently disclosed crystal structure  of the kinase, harmine analogs were designed that resulted in significantly  increased haspin kinase inhibitory potency. The harmine derivatives also  demonstrated less activity towards DYRK2 compared to the acridine series. In  vitro mouse liver microsome stability and kinase profiling of a representative  member of the harmine series (42, LDN-211898) are also presented.', 'New evidence from three separate laboratories, published recently in Science,  has shown that centromere positioning of the CPC (chromosomal passenger complex)  during early mitosis is achieved through direct interaction between the CPP  (chromosomal passenger protein) survivin and histone H3. In essence, an acidic  pocket in the BIR (baculovirus inhibitor of apoptosis repeat) domain of survivin  binds to the NH2 tail of histone H3 specifically when it is phosphorylated at  threonine 3, a mark that is placed by the mitotic kinase, haspin. These data are  significant, as they describe a fundamental mechanism, conserved throughout  eukaryotes, which is essential for chromosome biorientation and the maintenance  of genome stability during mitosis.', 'Aurora B is the catalytic subunit of the chromosomal passenger complex (CPC),  which coordinates mitotic processes through phosphorylation of key regulatory  proteins. In prometaphase, the CPC is enriched at the centromeres to regulate  the spindle checkpoint and kinetochore-microtubule interactions. Centromeric CPC  binds to histone H3 that is phosphorylated at T3 (H3T3ph) by Aurora B-stimulated  Haspin. PP1/Repo-Man acts antagonistically to Haspin and dephosphorylates H3T3ph  at the chromosome arms but is somehow prevented from causing a net  dephosphorylation of centromeric H3T3ph during prometaphase. Here, we show that  Aurora B phosphorylates Repo-Man at S893, preventing its recruitment by  histones. We also identify PP2A as a mitotic interactor of Repo-Man that  dephosphorylates S893 and thereby promotes the targeting of Repo-Man to  chromosomes and the dephosphorylation of H3T3ph by PP1. Thus,  Repo-Man-associated PP1 and PP2A collaborate to oppose the chromosomal targeting  of Aurora B. We propose that the reciprocal feedback regulation of Haspin and  Repo-Man by Aurora B generates a robust bistable response that culminates in the  centromeric targeting of the CPC during prometaphase.']",Haspin phosphorylates histone H3 at Thr3 (H3T3ph) during mitosis
61,What is the importance of Janus Kinases in dermatology?,"[""BACKGROUND: Psoriasis is a chronic, inflammatory skin disease with a significant  impact on health-related quality of life (HRQoL). Tofacitinib (CP-690,550) is a  novel, oral Janus kinase inhibitor that is being investigated as a targeted  immunomodulator. OBJECTIVE: This Phase 2b study assessed three tofacitinib dosage regimens vs.  placebo to characterize the efficacy and safety of tofacitinib in patients with  moderate-to-severe chronic plaque psoriasis. We report the patient-reported  outcome (PRO) data. METHODS: A total of 197 patients were randomized to tofacitinib 2, 5, 15\xa0mg  twice daily or placebo for 12\xa0weeks. Six PRO questionnaires were completed  during the study: Dermatology Life Quality Index, Itch Severity Score (ISS),  Short Form-36 questionnaire, version 2 (SF-36), Pain/Discomfort Assessment  (PDA), Patient Satisfaction with Study Medication (PSSM) item and Patient Global  Assessment of psoriasis. RESULTS: Treatment with tofacitinib resulted in significant, dose-dependent  improvements in several PROs vs. placebo from week 2 onwards. At week 12, least  squares mean changes from baseline for Dermatology life quality index, ISS and  SF-36 mental component scores were significantly greater for all active drug  arms vs. placebo (P\xa0<\xa00.05), and significantly greater for tofacitinib 5 and 15  mg for SF-36 physical component scores vs. placebo (P\xa0<\xa00.05). At week 12, all  dose groups had significantly greater numbers of patients reporting 'Clear' or  'Almost clear' on the PtGA vs. placebo. CONCLUSION: In patients with moderate-to-severe chronic plaque psoriasis,  short-term (12-week) treatment with oral twice-daily tofacitinib improves HRQoL  outcomes and patient assessment of disease severity and symptoms, with an early  onset noted."", 'BACKGROUND: New therapeutic options are needed for patients with psoriasis.  Tofacitinib, an oral Janus kinase inhibitor, is being investigated as a  treatment for moderate-to-severe chronic plaque psoriasis. In this study, we  aimed to compare two tofacitinib doses with high-dose etanercept or placebo in  this patient population. METHODS: In this phase 3, randomised, multicentre, double-dummy,  placebo-controlled, 12-week, non-inferiority trial, adult patients with chronic  stable plaque psoriasis (for ≥12 months) who were candidates for systemic or  phototherapy and had a Psoriasis Area and Severity Index (PASI) score of 12 or  higher and a Physician\'s Global Assessment (PGA) of moderate or severe, and had  failed to respond to, had a contraindication to, or were intolerant to at least  one conventional systemic therapy, were enrolled from 122 investigational  dermatology centres worldwide. Eligible patients were randomly assigned in a  3:3:3:1 ratio to receive tofacitinib 5 mg or 10 mg twice daily at about 12 h  intervals, etanercept 50 mg subcutaneously twice weekly at about 3-4 day  intervals, or placebo. Randomisation was done by a computer-generated  randomisation schedule, and all patients and study personnel were masked to  treatment assignment. The co-primary endpoints were the proportion of patients  at week 12 with at least a 75% reduction in the PASI score from baseline (PASI75  response) and the proportion of patients achieving a PGA score of ""clear"" or  ""almost clear"" (PGA response), analysed in the full analysis set (all patients  who were randomised and received at least one dose of study drug). This study is  registered with ClinicalTrials.gov, number NCT01241591. FINDINGS: Between Nov 29, 2010, and Sept 13, 2012, we enrolled 1106 eligible  adult patients with chronic plaque psoriasis and randomly assigned them to the  four treatment groups (330 to tofacitinib 5 mg twice daily, 332 to tofacitinib  10 mg twice daily, 336 to etanercept 50 mg twice weekly, and 108 to placebo). Of  these patients, 1101 actually received their assigned study medication (329 in  the tofactinib 5 mg group, 330 in the tofacitinib 10 mg group, 335 in the  etanercept group, and 107 in the placebo group). At week 12, PASI75 responses  were recorded in 130 (39·5%) of 329 patients in the tofacitinib 5 mg group, 210  (63·6%) of 330 in the tofacitinib 10 mg group, 197 (58·8%) of 335 in the  etanercept group, and six (5·6%) of 107 in the placebo group. A PGA response was  achieved by 155 (47·1%) of 329 patients in the tofacitinib 5 mg group, 225  (68·2%) of 330 in the tofacitinib 10 mg group, 222 (66·3%) of 335 in the  etanercept group, and 16 (15·0%) of 107 in the placebo group. The rate of  adverse events was similar across the four groups, with serious adverse events  occurring in seven (2%) of 329 patients in the tofacitinib 5 mg group, five (2%)  of 330 in the tofacitinib 10 mg group, seven (2%) of 335 in the etanercept  group, and two (2%) of 107 in the placebo group. Three (1%) of 329 patients in  the tofacitinib 5 mg group, ten (3%) of 330 in the tofacitinib 10 mg group, 11  (3%) of 335 in the etanercept group, and four (4%) of 107 patients in the  placebo group discontinued their assigned treatment because of adverse events. INTERPRETATION: In patients with moderate-to-severe plaque psoriasis, the 10 mg  twice daily dose of tofacitinib was non-inferior to etanercept 50 mg twice  weekly and was superior to placebo, but the 5 mg twice daily dose did not show  non-inferiority to etanercept 50 mg twice weekly. The adverse event rates over  12 weeks were similar for tofacitinib and etanercept. This study indicates that  in the future tofacitinib could provide a convenient and well-tolerated  therapeutic option for patients with moderate-to-severe plaque psoriasis. FUNDING: Pfizer Inc.', 'BACKGROUND: Plaque psoriasis is a chronic and often debilitating skin disorder  and proinflammatory cytokines are known to play a key role in the disease  process. OBJECTIVES: To evaluate the safety and efficacy of baricitinib, an oral Janus  kinase (JAK) 1/JAK2 inhibitor, in patients with moderate-to-severe psoriasis in  a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, dose-ranging phase 2b study. METHODS: Patients were randomized (n = 271) to receive placebo or oral  baricitinib at 2, 4, 8 or 10 mg once daily for 12 weeks (Part A). Dose  adjustment for 12 additional weeks was based on percentage improvement in the  Psoriasis Area and Severity Index (PASI) score. The primary end point was  Psoriasis Area and Severity Index (PASI) 75% (PASI-75) at 12 weeks for North  American patients (n = 238); secondary end points were safety and efficacy  measures in the entire population. RESULTS: At week 12, more North American patients in the 8-mg (43%) and 10-mg  (54%) baricitinib groups than in placebo group (17%; P < 0·05) achieved PASI-75.  All baricitinib-treated groups had greater mean changes from baseline in their  PASI scores (P < 0·05) at 12 weeks and (except 2 mg) had higher rates of PASI-50  than the placebo group; statistically significant PASI-90 responses were  achieved in the 8-mg and 10-mg groups at 8 and 12 weeks. More than 81% of  PASI-75 responders maintained their scores through 24 weeks. During Part A,  study discontinuations due to adverse events (AEs) were 0%, 0%, 2·8%, 6·3% and  5·8% and treatment-emergent AE rates were 44%, 50%, 47%, 58% and 64% for placebo  and 2-, 4-, 8- and 10-mg baricitinib groups, respectively. No opportunistic  infections were observed in any treatment group. Dose-dependent changes in  laboratory values were observed. CONCLUSIONS: Patients with moderate-to-severe psoriasis treated with baricitinib  for 12 weeks achieved significant improvements in PASI-75.', 'Alopecia areata (AA) is a common autoimmune disease resulting from damage of the  hair follicle by T cells. The immune pathways required for autoreactive T cell  activation in AA are not defined limiting clinical development of rational  targeted therapies. Genome-wide association studies (GWAS) implicated ligands  for the NKG2D receptor (product of the KLRK1 gene) in disease pathogenesis.  Here, we show that cytotoxic CD8(+)NKG2D(+) T cells are both necessary and  sufficient for the induction of AA in mouse models of disease. Global  transcriptional profiling of mouse and human AA skin revealed gene expression  signatures indicative of cytotoxic T cell infiltration, an interferon-γ (IFN-γ)  response and upregulation of several γ-chain (γc) cytokines known to promote the  activation and survival of IFN-γ-producing CD8(+)NKG2D(+) effector T cells.  Therapeutically, antibody-mediated blockade of IFN-γ, interleukin-2 (IL-2) or  interleukin-15 receptor β (IL-15Rβ) prevented disease development, reducing the  accumulation of CD8(+)NKG2D(+) T cells in the skin and the dermal IFN response  in a mouse model of AA. Systemically administered pharmacological inhibitors of  Janus kinase (JAK) family protein tyrosine kinases, downstream effectors of the  IFN-γ and γc cytokine receptors, eliminated the IFN signature and prevented the  development of AA, while topical administration promoted hair regrowth and  reversed established disease. Notably, three patients treated with oral  ruxolitinib, an inhibitor of JAK1 and JAK2, achieved near-complete hair regrowth  within 5 months of treatment, suggesting the potential clinical utility of JAK  inhibition in human AA.', 'BACKGROUND: Length and intensity of signal transduction via cytokine receptors  is precisely regulated. Degradation of certain cytokine receptors is mediated by  the ubiquitin ligase SCF(βTrCP). In several instances, Janus kinase (Jak) family  members can stabilise their cognate cytokine receptors at the cell surface. PRINCIPAL FINDINGS: In this study we show in Hek293 cells that Jak2 binding to  the growth hormone receptor prevents endocytosis in a non-catalytic manner.  Following receptor activation, the detachment of phosphorylated Jak2 induces  down-regulation of the growth hormone receptor by SCF(βTrCP). Using γ2A human  fibroblast cells we show that both growth hormone-induced and constitutive  growth hormone receptor endocytosis depend on the same factors, strongly  suggesting that the modes of endocytosis are identical. Different Jak2 RNA  levels in HepG2, IM9 and Hek293 cells indicate the importance of cellular  concentration on growth hormone receptor function. Both Jak2 and βTrCP bind to  neighbouring linear motifs in the growth hormone receptor tail without the  requirement of modifications, indicating that growth hormone sensitivity is  regulated by the cellular level of non-committed Jak2. CONCLUSIONS/SIGNIFICANCE: As signal transduction of many cytokine receptors  depends on Jak2, the study suggests an integrative role of Jak2 in cytokine  responses based on its enzyme activity as well as its stabilising properties  towards the receptors.', 'BACKGROUND: The Janus kinase (JAK) family of tyrosine kinases includes JAK1,  JAK2, JAK3 and TYK2, and is required for signaling through Type I and Type II  cytokine receptors. CP-690,550 is a potent and selective JAK inhibitor currently  in clinical trials for rheumatoid arthritis (RA) and other autoimmune disease  indications. In RA trials, dose-dependent decreases in neutrophil counts (PBNC)  were observed with CP-690,550 treatment. These studies were undertaken to better  understand the relationship between JAK selectivity and PBNC decreases observed  with CP-690,550 treatment. METHODS: Potency and selectivity of CP-690,550 for mouse, rat and human JAKs was  evaluated in a panel of in vitro assays. The effect of CP-690,550 on  granulopoiesis from progenitor cells was also assessed in vitro using colony  forming assays. In vivo the potency of orally administered CP-690,550 on  arthritis (paw edema), plasma cytokines, PBNC and bone marrow differentials were  evaluated in the rat adjuvant-induced arthritis (AIA) model. RESULTS: CP-690,550 potently inhibited signaling through JAK1 and JAK3 with  5-100 fold selectivity over JAK2 in cellular assays, despite inhibiting all four  JAK isoforms with nM potency in in vitro enzyme assays. Dose-dependent  inhibition of paw edema was observed in vivo with CP-690,550 treatment. Plasma  cytokines (IL-6 and IL-17), PBNC, and bone marrow myeloid progenitor cells were  elevated in the context of AIA disease. At efficacious exposures, CP-690,550  returned all of these parameters to pre-disease levels. The plasma concentration  of CP-690,550 at efficacious doses was above the in vitro whole blood IC50 of  JAK1 and JAK3 inhibition, but not that of JAK2. CONCLUSION: Results from this investigation suggest that CP-690,550 is a potent  inhibitor of JAK1 and JAK3 with potentially reduced cellular potency for JAK2.  In rat AIA, as in the case of human RA, PBNC were decreased at efficacious  exposures of CP-690,550. Inflammatory end points were similarly reduced, as  judged by attenuation of paw edema and cytokines IL-6 and IL-17. Plasma  concentration at these exposures was consistent with inhibition of JAK1 and JAK3  but not JAK2. Decreases in PBNC following CP-690,550 treatment may thus be  related to attenuation of inflammation and are likely not due to suppression of  granulopoiesis through JAK2 inhibition.', 'Alopecia areata (AA) is a common autoimmune disease resulting from damage of the  hair follicle by T cells. The immune pathways required for autoreactive T cell  activation in AA are not defined limiting clinical development of rational  targeted therapies. Genome-wide association studies (GWAS) implicated ligands  for the NKG2D receptor (product of the KLRK1 gene) in disease pathogenesis.  Here, we show that cytotoxic CD8(+)NKG2D(+) T cells are both necessary and  sufficient for the induction of AA in mouse models of disease. Global  transcriptional profiling of mouse and human AA skin revealed gene expression  signatures indicative of cytotoxic T cell infiltration, an interferon-γ (IFN-γ)  response and upregulation of several γ-chain (γc) cytokines known to promote the  activation and survival of IFN-γ-producing CD8(+)NKG2D(+) effector T cells.  Therapeutically, antibody-mediated blockade of IFN-γ, interleukin-2 (IL-2) or  interleukin-15 receptor β (IL-15Rβ) prevented disease development, reducing the  accumulation of CD8(+)NKG2D(+) T cells in the skin and the dermal IFN response  in a mouse model of AA. Systemically administered pharmacological inhibitors of  Janus kinase (JAK) family protein tyrosine kinases, downstream effectors of the  IFN-γ and γc cytokine receptors, eliminated the IFN signature and prevented the  development of AA, while topical administration promoted hair regrowth and  reversed established disease. Notably, three patients treated with oral  ruxolitinib, an inhibitor of JAK1 and JAK2, achieved near-complete hair regrowth  within 5 months of treatment, suggesting the potential clinical utility of JAK  inhibition in human AA.', 'Janus kinase (JAK) is one of the main upstream activators of signal transducers  and activators of transcription (STAT) that are constitutively activated in  various malignancies and are associated with cell growth, survival, and  carcinogenesis. Here, we investigated the role of JAKs in colorectal cancer in  order to develop effective therapeutic targets for INCB018424, which is the  first JAK1/2 inhibitor to be approved by FDA. After examining the basal  expression levels of phospho-JAK1 and phospho-JAK2, we measured the effects of  INCB018424 on the phosphorylation of JAK1/2 using western blot analysis. Cell  viability was determined using the trypan blue exclusion assay. The cell death  mechanism was identified by the activation of caspase 3 using western blot and  annexin V staining. The basal levels of phospho-JAK1 and phospho-JAK2 were  cancer cell type dependent. Colorectal cancer cell lines that phosphorylate both  JAK1 and JAK2 include DLD-1 and RKO. INCB018424 inactivates both JAK1 and JAK2  in DLD-1 cells but inactivates only JAK1 in RKO cells. Cell death was  proportional to the inactivation of JAK1 but not JAK2. INCB018424 causes  caspase-dependent cell death, which is prevented by treatment with z-VAD. The  inhibition of JAK1 phosphorylation seemed sufficient to allow  INCB018424-mediated apoptosis. JAK1 is a key molecule that is involved in colon  cancer cell survival and the inhibition of JAK1 by INCB01424 results in  caspase-dependent apoptosis in colorectal cancer cells. The use of selective  JAK1 inhibitors could be an attractive therapy against colorectal cancer, but  further clinical investigations are needed to test this possibility.', 'There is a critical need for safer and more convenient treatments for organ  transplant rejection and autoimmune disorders such as rheumatoid arthritis.  Janus tyrosine kinases (JAK1, JAK3) are expressed in lymphoid cells and are  involved in the signaling of multiple cytokines important for various T cell  functions. Blockade of the JAK1/JAK3-STAT pathway with a small molecule was  anticipated to provide therapeutic immunosuppression/immunomodulation. The  Pfizer compound library was screened against the catalytic domain of JAK3  resulting in the identification of a pyrrolopyrimidine-based series of  inhibitors represented by CP-352,664 (2a). Synthetic analogues of 2a were  screened against the JAK enzymes and evaluated in an IL-2 induced T cell blast  proliferation assay. Select compounds were evaluated in rodent efficacy models  of allograft rejection and destructive inflammatory arthritis. Optimization  within this chemical series led to identification of CP-690,550 1, a potential  first-in-class JAK inhibitor for treatment of autoimmune diseases and organ  transplant rejection.', 'The primary cilium is essential for skin morphogenesis through regulating the  Notch, Wnt, and hedgehog signaling pathways. Prior studies on the functions of  primary cilia in the skin were based on the investigations of genes that are  essential for cilium formation. However, none of these ciliogenic genes has been  linked to ciliopathy, a group of disorders caused by abnormal formation or  function of cilia. To determine whether there is a genetic and molecular link  between ciliopathies and skin morphogenesis, we investigated the role of  RPGRIP1L, a gene mutated in Joubert (JBTS) and Meckel (MKS) syndromes, two  severe forms of ciliopathy, in the context of skin development. We found that  RPGRIP1L is essential for hair follicle morphogenesis. Specifically, disrupting  the Rpgrip1l gene in mice resulted in reduced proliferation and differentiation  of follicular keratinocytes, leading to hair follicle developmental defects.  These defects were associated with significantly decreased primary cilium  formation and attenuated hedgehog signaling. In contrast, we found that hair  follicle induction and polarization and the development of interfollicular  epidermis were unaffected. This study indicates that RPGRIP1L, a ciliopathy  gene, is essential for hair follicle morphogenesis likely through regulating  primary cilia formation and the hedgehog signaling pathway.']","Janus Kinase (JAK) is active in many skin diseases and recent evidence show that inhibitors of JAK kinase could be used to treat vitiligo, psoriasis, lupus, alopecia areata and other inflammatory skin diseases."
62,Describe the mechanism of action of a drug Elagolix.,"['This randomized double-blind study, with 24-week treatment and 24-week  posttreatment periods, evaluated the effects of elagolix (150 mg every day, 75  mg twice a day) versus subcutaneous depot medroxyprogesterone acetate (DMPA-SC)  on bone mineral density (BMD), in women with endometriosis-associated pain (n =  252). All treatments induced minimal mean changes from baseline in BMD at week  24 (elagolix 150 mg: -0.11%/-0.47%, elagolix 75 mg: -1.29%/-1.2%, and DMPA-SC:  0.99%/-1.29% in the spine and total hip, respectively), with similar or less  changes at week 48 (posttreatment). Elagolix was associated with improvements in  endometriosis-associated pain, assessed with composite pelvic signs and symptoms  score (CPSSS) and visual analogue scale, including statistical noninferiority to  DMPA-SC in dysmenorrhea and nonmenstrual pelvic pain components of the CPSSS.  The most common adverse events (AEs) in elagolix groups were headache, nausea,  and nasopharyngitis, whereas the most common AEs in the DMPA-SC group were  headache, nausea, upper respiratory tract infection, and mood swings. This study  showed that similar to DMPA-SC, elagolix treatment had minimal impact on BMD  over a 24-week period and demonstrated similar efficacy on  endometriosis-associated pain.', 'OBJECTIVE: To evaluate the efficacy and safety of elagolix, an oral, nonpeptide  gonadotropin-releasing hormone antagonist, over 12 months in women with  endometriosis-associated pain. METHODS: Elaris Endometriosis (EM)-III and -IV were extension studies that  evaluated an additional 6 months of treatment after two 6-month, double-blind,  placebo-controlled phase 3 trials (12 continuous treatment months) with two  elagolix doses (150 mg once daily and 200 mg twice daily). Coprimary efficacy  endpoints were the proportion of responders (clinically meaningful pain  reduction and stable or decreased rescue analgesic use) based on average monthly  dysmenorrhea and nonmenstrual pelvic pain scores. Safety assessments included  adverse events, clinical laboratory tests, and endometrial and bone mineral  density assessments. The power of Elaris EM-III and -IV was based on the  comparison to placebo in Elaris EM-I and -II with an expected 25% dropout rate. RESULTS: Between December 28, 2012, and October 31, 2014 (Elaris EM-III), and  between May 27, 2014, and January 6, 2016 (Elaris EM-IV), 569 participants were  enrolled. After 12 months of treatment, Elaris EM-III responder rates for  dysmenorrhea were 52.1% at 150 mg once daily (Elaris EM-IV 550.8%) and 78.2% at  200 mg twice daily (Elaris EMIV 575.9%). Elaris EM-III nonmenstrual pelvic pain  responder rates were 67.5% at 150 mg once daily (Elaris EM-IV 566.4%) and 69.1%  at 200 mg twice daily (Elaris EM-IV 567.2%).”After 12 months of treatment,  Elaris EM-III dyspareunia responder rates were 45.2% at 150 mg once daily  (Elaris EM-IV=45.9%) and 60.0% at 200 mg twice daily (Elaris EM-IV=58.1%). Hot  flush was the most common adverse event. Decreases from baseline in bone mineral  density and increases from baseline in lipids were observed after 12 months of  treatment. There were no adverse endometrial findings. CONCLUSION: Long-term elagolix treatment provided sustained reductions in  dysmenorrhea, nonmenstrual pelvic pain, and dyspareunia. The safety was  consistent with reduced estrogen levels and no new safety concerns were  associated with long-term elagolix use.

METHODS: This was a phase II, randomized, placebo-controlled parallel group  study conducted at 37 US centers, consisting of an 8-week double-blind period  followed by a 16-week open-label period. Patients were 137 women aged 18 to 49,  with laparoscopically confirmed endometriosis and moderate to severe  nonmenstrual pelvic pain and dysmenorrhea, who were administered elagolix 150 mg  daily or placebo. The primary outcomes of the study were the daily assessment of  dysmenorrhea, nonmenstrual pelvic pain and dyspareunia using a modified  Biberoglu-Behrman scale. RESULTS: During the double-blind period, there were significantly greater mean  reductions from baseline to week 8 in dysmenorrhea (-1.13 ± 0.11 vs. -0.37 ±  0.11, p<0.0001), nonmenstrual pelvic pain (-0.47 ± 0.07 vs. -0.19 ± 0.07, p =  0.0066), and dyspareunia scores (-0.61 ± 0.10 vs. -0.23 ± 0.10, p = 0.0070) in  the elagolix group compared with placebo.

The aim of our study was to review all available trials  to investigate the medical treatment of endometriosis with only GnRH  antagonists, with special attention to pharmacodynamic activity, safety, and  efficacy. METHODS: Pub Med and Sciencedirect database were searched using terms of  ""endometriosis treatment"", ""GnRH antagonist"", and ""Elagolix"". The search was  limited to clinical studies published in English. Title and abstract were  screened to identify relevant articles. RESULTS: Five studies covering use of GnRH antagonist were found. A phase 1  study evaluated the safety, pharmacokinetics, and inhibitory effects on  gonadotropins and estradiol of single dose and 7 day elagolix administration to  healthy premenopausal women; two phase II studies evaluated efficacy in patient  with endometriosis. Moreover, there are two Phase III clinical trials just  completed. CONCLUSION: GnRH antagonists may have the advantage of oral administration and  lower incidence of adverse events. Currently, only Phase II studies have been  published demonstrating promising results in terms of efficacy, safety, and  tolerability. From the results of the phase III studies, elagolix may become a  valuable addition to the armamentarium of pharmacological agents to treat  endometriosis-related pain.', ""Uterine fibroids (UFs) are the most common gynaecological benign disease. Even  though often asymptomatic, UFs can worsen women's health and their quality of  life, causing heavy bleeding and anaemia, pelvic discomfort and reduced  fertility. Surgical treatment of UFs could be limited by its invasiveness and  the desire to preserve fertility. Thus, effective medical therapies for the  management of this condition are needed. Common drugs used to control bleeding,  such us hormonal contraceptive or levonorgestrel-releasing intrauterine system,  have no effect on fibroids volume. Among other more efficient treatments, the  gonadotropin-releasing hormone (GnRH) agonist or the selective  progesterone-receptor modulators have a non-neutral safety profile; thus, they  are used for limited periods or for cyclic treatments. Elagolix is a potent,  orally bioavailable, non-peptide GnRH antagonist that acts by a competitive  block of the GnRH receptor. The biological effect is a dose-dependent inhibition  of gonadal axis, without a total suppression of estradiol concentrations. For  this reason, even though comparative studies between elagolix and GnRH agonists  have not been performed, elagolix has been associated with a better profile of  adverse events. Recently, elagolix received US FDA approval for the treatment of  moderate to severe pain caused by endometriosis. Several clinical trials  assessed the efficacy of elagolix for the treatment of heavy bleeding caused by  UFs and the definitive results of Phase III studies are expected. Available data  on elagolix and UFs showed that the drug, with or without low-dose hormone  add-back therapy, is able to significantly reduce menstrual blood loss, lead to  amenorrhea and improve haemoglobin concentrations in the majority of  participants in comparison with placebo. The safety and tolerability profile  appeared generally acceptable. The concomitant use of add-back therapy can  prevent bone loss due to the hypoestrogenic effect and can improve safety during  elagolix treatment."", 'BACKGROUND: Uterine fibroids are one of the most common neoplasms found among  women globally, with a prevalence of approximately 11 million women in the  United States alone. The morbidity of this common disease is significant because  it is the leading cause of hysterectomy and causes significant functional  impairment for women of reproductive age. Factors including age, body mass  index, race, ethnicity, menstrual blood loss, fibroid location, and uterine and  fibroid volume influence the incidence of fibroids and severity of symptoms.  Elagolix is an oral gonadotropin-releasing hormone receptor antagonist that  competitively inhibits pituitary gonadotropin-releasing hormone receptor  activity and suppresses the release of gonadotropins from the pituitary gland,  resulting in dose-dependent suppression of ovarian sex hormones, follicular  growth, and ovulation. In Elaris Uterine Fibroids 1 and Uterine Fibroids 2, 2  replicate multicenter, double-blind, randomized, placebo-controlled, phase 3  studies, treatment of premenopausal women with elagolix with hormonal add-back  therapy demonstrated reduction in heavy menstrual bleeding associated with  uterine fibroids. OBJECTIVE: This analysis aimed to evaluate the safety and efficacy of elagolix  (300 mg twice a day) with add-back therapy (1 mg estradiol/0.5 mg norethindrone  acetate once a day) in reducing heavy menstrual bleeding associated with uterine  fibroids in various subgroups of women over 6 months of treatment. STUDY DESIGN: Data were pooled from Elaris Uterine Fibroid-1 and Uterine  Fibroid-2 studies, which evaluated premenopausal women (18-51 years) with heavy  menstrual bleeding (>80 mL menstrual blood loss per cycle, alkaline hematin  methodology) and ultrasound-confirmed uterine fibroid diagnosis. Subgroups  analyzed included age, body mass index, race, ethnicity, baseline menstrual  blood loss, fibroid location, and uterine and primary fibroid volume (largest  fibroid identified by ultrasound). The primary endpoint was the proportion of  women with <80 mL menstrual blood loss during the final month and ≥50% menstrual  blood loss reduction from baseline to final month. Secondary and other efficacy  endpoints included mean change in menstrual blood loss from baseline to final  month, amenorrhea, symptom severity, and health-related quality of life. Adverse  events and other safety endpoints were monitored. RESULTS: The overall pooled Elaris Uterine Fibroid-1 and Uterine Fibroid-2  population was typical of women with fibroids, with a mean age of 42.4 (standard  deviation, 5.4) years and a mean body mass index of 33.6 (standard deviation,  7.3) kg/m2 and 67.6% of participants being black or African American women. A  wide range of baseline uterine and fibroid volumes and menstrual blood loss were  also represented in the overall pooled study population. In all subgroups, the  proportion of responders to the primary endpoint, mean change in menstrual blood  loss, amenorrhea, reduction in symptom severity, and improvement in  health-related quality of life were clinically meaningfully greater for women  who received elagolix with add-back therapy than those who received placebo and  consistent with the overall pooled study population for the primary endpoint  (72.2% vs 9.3%), mean change in menstrual blood loss (-172.5 mL vs\xa0-0.8 mL),  amenorrhea (50.4% vs 4.5%), symptom severity (-37.1 vs\xa0-9.2), and health-related  quality of life score (39.9 vs 8.9). Adverse events by subgroup were consistent  with the overall pooled study population. CONCLUSION: Elagolix with hormonal add-back therapy was effective in reducing  heavy menstrual bleeding associated with uterine fibroids independent of age,  body mass index, race, ethnicity, baseline menstrual blood loss, fibroid  location, and uterine and primary fibroid volume.']","Elagolix is a novel, orally active, non-peptide, competitive gonadotropin-releasing hormone (GnRH) receptor antagonist.

63,Is recommended the use of perioperative treatment with thyroid hormone therapy in patients undergoing coronary artery bypass grafting?,"['OBJECTIVE: Despite improved perioperative management, atrial fibrillation (AF)  after coronary artery bypass grafting (CABG) remains a relevant clinical  problem, whose pathogenetic mechanisms remain incompletely explained. A reduced  incidence of postoperative AF has been described in CABG patients receiving IV  tri-iodothyronine (T3). This study was designed to define the role of thyroid  metabolism on the genesis of postoperative AF. METHODS AND RESULTS: Free T3 (fT3), free thyroxine (fT4), and thyroid  stimulating hormone were assayed at admission in 107 consecutive patients  undergoing isolated CABG surgery. Patients with thyroid disease or taking drugs  known to interfere with thyroid function were excluded. A preoperative rhythm  other than sinus rhythm was considered an exclusion criterion. Thirty-three  patients (30.8%) had postoperative AF. An older age (P=0.03), no therapy with  beta-blockers (P=0.08), chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (P=0.08), lower  left ventricle ejection fraction (P=0.09) and lower fT3 concentration (P=0.001),  were univariate predictors of postoperative AF. On multivariate analysis, low  fT3 concentration and lack of beta-blocking therapy were independently related  with the development of postoperative AF (odds ratio, OR, 4.425; 95% confidence  interval, CI, 1.745-11.235; P=0.001 and OR 3.107; 95% CI 1.087-8.875; P=0.03,  respectively). Postoperative AF significantly prolonged postoperative hospital  stay (P=0.002). CONCLUSIONS: Low basal fT3 concentration can reliably predict the occurrence of  postoperative AF in CABG patients.', 'CONTEXT: Effects of thyroid hormone therapy on postoperative morbidity and  mortality in adults remain controversial. OBJECTIVE: The aim was to conduct a systematic review evaluating effects and  risks of postoperative T(3) therapy in adults. DATA SOURCES: Electronic databases and reference lists through March 2010 were  searched. STUDY SELECTION: Studies with comparable control groups comparing T(3) to  placebo therapy in randomized controlled trials were selected. DATA EXTRACTION: Two reviewers independently screened and reviewed titles,  abstracts, and articles. Data were abstracted from 14 randomized controlled  trials (13 cardiac surgery and one renal transplantation). In seven studies, iv  T(3) was given in high doses (0.175-0.333 μg/kg · h) for 6 to 9 h, in four  studies iv T(3) was given in low doses (0.0275-0.0333 μg/kg · h for 14 to 24 h),  and in three studies T(3) was given orally in variable doses and durations. DATA SYNTHESIS: Both high- and low-dose iv T(3) therapy increased cardiac index  after coronary artery bypass surgery. Mortality was not significantly altered by  high-dose iv T(3) therapy and could not be assessed for low-dose iv or oral  T(3). Effects on systemic vascular resistance, heart rate, pulmonary capillary  wedge pressure, new onset atrial fibrillation, inotrope use, serum TSH and T(4)  were inconclusive. LIMITATIONS: Numbers of usable unique studies and group sizes were small.  Duration of T(3) therapy was short, and dosages and routes of administration  varied. CONCLUSIONS: Short duration postoperative iv T(3) therapy increases cardiac  index and does not alter mortality. Effects on other parameters are  inconclusive.', 'Cardiac surgery using cardiopulmonary bypass produces a generalized systemic  inflammatory response, resulting in increased postoperative morbidity and  mortality. Under these circumstances, a typical pattern of thyroid abnormalities  is seen in the absence of primary disease, defined as sick euthyroid syndrome  (SES). The presence of postoperative SES mainly in small children and neonates  exposed to long bypass times and the pharmacological profile of thyroid hormones  and their effects on the cardiovascular physiology make supplementation therapy  an attractive treatment option to improve postoperative morbidity and mortality.  Many studies have been performed with conflicting results. In this article, we  review the important literature on the development of SES in paediatric  postoperative cardiac patients, analyse the existing information on thyroid  hormone replacement therapy in this patient group and try to summarize the  findings for a recommendation.', 'Thyroid hormone alterations (known as the ""sick-euthyroid syndrome"") are common  following major surgery, but the time course for appearance and recovery from  these alterations has not previously been longitudinally studied in a large  group of surgical patients. The authors prospectively studied 59 patients  undergoing major surgery (coronary artery bypass grafting, pneumonectomy, or  subtotal colectomy). Compared with preoperative values, the mean serum T4, T3,  free T3, and TSH concentrations decreased significantly (p less than 0.05)  following surgery. Serum reverse T3 and T3 resin uptake index increased, while  free T4 levels remained unchanged. These changes were seen within 6 hours of  surgery and normalized by 1 week after surgery. Although the serum TSH response  to TRH was normal before and after surgery in 56 of the 59 patients, the maximal  TRH-induced increase in serum TSH and the integrated serum TSH response to TRH  were suppressed in the early perioperative period. This postoperative TSH  suppression correlated with elevated postoperative plasma dopamine  concentrations (r = 0.57, p less than 0.05). Three patients with compensated  primary hypothyroidism were detected in the study and represent the first  documentation of serial thyroid hormone and TSH levels in hypothyroid patients  undergoing major surgery. These patients had similar changes in thyroid hormone  values compared with euthyroid patients. The serum TSH response to TRH was  suppressed into the normal range in two of these patients on the day following  surgery. The authors conclude that the sick-euthyroid syndrome occurs within a  few hours of major surgery and remits with convalescence. Postoperative  decreases in serum TSH may mask the diagnosis of hypothyroidism. Surgical  consultants should be aware of these rapid postoperative changes so that thyroid  function tests are properly interpreted in patients who have undergone major  surgery.', 'BACKGROUND: The impact of thyroid disease on patients undergoing coronary artery  bypass grafting has been reported in only small series of selected patients. METHODS: We investigated 30-day mortality of patients on thyroxine replacement  therapy undergoing isolated coronary artery bypass grafting from 1993 to 2000  and identified variables of importance for outcome. RESULTS: A total of 3,631 patients (606 women) had isolated coronary artery  bypass grafting of whom 58 patients (30 women) were treated for hypothyroidism.  The mortality rate was higher among women with thyroxine replacement (16.7%, 95%  confidence interval [CI] 5.6 to 34.7) than those without thyroxine replacement  (5.9%, 95% CI 4.1 to 8.2; p = 0.02) and no difference between men with (3.6%,  95% CI 0.1 to 17.8) and without (2.6%, 95% CI 2.0 to 3.2) thyroxine treatment (p  = 0.8). Intake of diuretics (p < 0.001) was directly associated with mortality  whereas intake of aspirin (p = 0.01), levothyroxine dose (p = 0.03), and serum  thyroxine level (p = 0.01) were inversely associated with mortality among women  on thyroxine replacement. CONCLUSIONS: Women on thyroxine replacement therapy undergoing coronary artery  bypass grafting had an increased mortality rate. We speculate that insufficient  thyroid hormone replacement could partly play a role in this outcome.', 'A controversy persists as to whether cardiopulmonary bypass (CPB) decreases  plasma levels of triiodothyronine (T3), thereby justifying peri-operative  administration of T3 to improve haemodynamic recovery. To examine the effects of  T3 therapy on post-CPB haemodynamics and to determine whether the potential  inotropic effects of T3 are mediated by an increase in beta-adrenergic  responsiveness, a prospective, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled  study was performed in 20 patients undergoing cardiac surgery with CPB. T3 or  placebo solution (10 patients in each group) was given intravenously at the time  of aortic unclamping and 4, 8, 12 and 20 h thereafter. End points included (1)  thyroid hormone levels measured by radioimmunoassay (2) standard haemodynamic  parameters (3) the density of lymphocyte beta-adrenoceptors measured by a  radioligand (125I-iodocyanopindolol) binding technique. Post-CPB values (cross  clamp removal) of T3 (pg.ml-1) were not significantly decreased compared with  pre-CPB values: 3.3 +/- 0.2 vs 3.1 +/- 0.2 in controls and 3.3 +/- 0.4 vs 3.7  +/- 0.6 in T3-treated patients, respectively. The haemodynamic parameters were  no different between the two groups at any postoperative time point. Likewise,  density and affinity of lymphocyte beta-adrenoceptors were not significantly  different from pre-operative values in either group. Thus, there seems to be no  sound justification for a routine use of T3 in patients undergoing open-heart  procedures.', 'Thyroid hormone has important effects on the heart and peripheral vascular  system. The relationship between thyroid disease states and cardiovascular  hemodynamics is well recognized. Diverse clinical situations are associated with  low serum triiodothyronine (T3) levels including a number of cardiovascular  illnesses. In particular, cardiopulmonary bypass and open heart operations  result in a low T3 state and are often complicated by significant cardiovascular  dysfunction similar to that observed in clinical hypothyroidism. Multiple lines  of evidence have suggested that T3 can act acutely as a positive inotrope and  vasodilator agent. This recognition has prompted a number of investigators to  study the effects of T3 administration to patients in the perioperative period.  This paper reviews the experimental background that supported such clinical  trials as well as outlines the results that have been documented in both adult  and pediatric patients undergoing cardiac surgery. Low serum T3 levels resulting  from cardiopulmonary bypass can be safely reversed with pharmacologic T3  supplementation. Data have suggested that T3 repletion may improve postoperative  hemodynamic performance and lower the incidence of arrythmias. However,  beneficial effects on major clinical outcome variables have not yet been  conclusively demonstrated, and require future large-scale clinical trials.', 'BACKGROUND: Although triiodothyronine deficiency has been described after  cardiopulmonary bypass, data supporting its use have been conflicting. A  double-blind, randomized, placebo-controlled study was undertaken to further  define the effect of triiodothyronine on hemodynamics and outcome after coronary  artery bypass grafting. METHODS: A total of 170 patients undergoing elective coronary artery bypass  grafting were enrolled and completed the study from November 1996 through March  1998. On removal of the aortic crossclamp, patients were randomized to receive  either intravenous triiodothyronine (0.4 microgram/kg bolus plus 0.1  microgram/kg infusion administered over a 6-hour period, n = 81) or placebo (n =  89). Outcome variables included hemodynamic profile and inotropic drug/pressor  requirements at several time points (mean +/- standard error of the mean),  perioperative morbidity (arrhythmia/ischemia/infarction), and mortality. RESULTS: Despite similar baseline characteristics, patients randomized to  triiodothyronine had a higher cardiac index and lower inotropic requirements  after the operation. Subjects receiving triiodothyronine demonstrated a  significantly lower incidence of postoperative myocardial ischemia (4% vs 18%, P  =.007) and pacemaker dependence (14% vs 25%, P =.013). Seven patients in the  placebo group required postoperative mechanical assistance (intra-aortic balloon  pump, n = 4; left ventricular assist device, n = 3), compared with none in the  triiodothyronine group (P =.01). There were 2 deaths in the placebo group and no  deaths in the triiodothyronine group. CONCLUSIONS: Parenteral triiodothyronine given after crossclamp removal during  elective coronary artery bypass grafting significantly improved postoperative  ventricular function, reduced the need for treatment with inotropic agents and  mechanical devices, and decreased the incidence of myocardial ischemia. The  incidence of atrial fibrillation was slightly decreased, and the need for  postoperative pacemaker support was reduced.', 'OBJECTIVE: Despite improved perioperative management, atrial fibrillation (AF)  after coronary artery bypass grafting (CABG) remains a relevant clinical  problem, whose pathogenetic mechanisms remain incompletely explained. A reduced  incidence of postoperative AF has been described in CABG patients receiving IV  tri-iodothyronine (T3). This study was designed to define the role of thyroid  metabolism on the genesis of postoperative AF. METHODS AND RESULTS: Free T3 (fT3), free thyroxine (fT4), and thyroid  stimulating hormone were assayed at admission in 107 consecutive patients  undergoing isolated CABG surgery. Patients with thyroid disease or taking drugs  known to interfere with thyroid function were excluded. A preoperative rhythm  other than sinus rhythm was considered an exclusion criterion. Thirty-three  patients (30.8%) had postoperative AF. An older age (P=0.03), no therapy with  beta-blockers (P=0.08), chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (P=0.08), lower  left ventricle ejection fraction (P=0.09) and lower fT3 concentration (P=0.001),  were univariate predictors of postoperative AF. On multivariate analysis, low  fT3 concentration and lack of beta-blocking therapy were independently related  with the development of postoperative AF (odds ratio, OR, 4.425; 95% confidence  interval, CI, 1.745-11.235; P=0.001 and OR 3.107; 95% CI 1.087-8.875; P=0.03,  respectively). Postoperative AF significantly prolonged postoperative hospital  stay (P=0.002). CONCLUSIONS: Low basal fT3 concentration can reliably predict the occurrence of  postoperative AF in CABG patients.', 'BACKGROUND: Cardiopulmonary bypass (CPB) is an established cause of nonthyroidal  illness syndrome (NTIS). Off-pump coronary artery bypass (OPCAB) has been  reported to be less invasive than coronary artery bypass grafting (CABG) with  CPB. We prospectively evaluated thyroid metabolism in OPCAB patients. METHODS: We analyzed free thyroid hormones (FT3 and FT4), thyroid-stimulating  hormone (TSH), and reverse T3 (rT3) in 20 consecutive patients undergoing CABG  surgery. Nine patients underwent CABG with CPB, and 11 underwent OPCAB. Blood  samples were taken on admission, on the day of surgery (7:30 AM), after  sternotomy, at the end of the operation, and at 2, 6, 12, 24, 36, 48, 72, 96,  120, and 144 hours postoperatively. The concentrations of FT3, FT4, and TSH were  determined on each sample. Reverse T3 concentration was measured in 10 patients  up to 48 hours and at 144 hours postoperatively. RESULTS: Baseline, operative, and postoperative variables were similar in the  two groups. FT3 concentration dropped significantly (p < 0.0001), reaching its  lowest value 12 hours postoperatively. There were no significant differences  between CPB and OPCAB patients. FT4 varied significantly in both groups (p <  0.0001), but remained in the normal range. TSH variation was not significant.  rT3 concentration rose significantly (p = 0.0002) in both groups, peaking 24  hours after surgery. CONCLUSIONS. OPCAB induces a NTIS similar to that observed  after CPB, probably due to the inhibition of T4 conversion to T3. This finding  suggests that NTIS is a nonspecific response to stress. CPB should not be  considered as the sole trigger of NTIS in cardiac surgical patients.']",Currently there is no substantial evidence to justify routine use of thyroid hormones in patients undergoing coronary artery bypass grafting.
64,Is enzastaurin effective treatment of glioblastoma?,"[""INTRODUCTION: Glioblastoma, the most common malignant brain tumor, exhibits a  poor prognosis with little therapeutic progress in the last decade. Novel  treatment strategies beyond the established standard of care with  temozolomide-based radiotherapy are urgently needed. AREAS COVERED: We reviewed the literature on glioblastoma with a focus on phase  III trials for pharmacotherapies and/or innovative concepts until December 2015. EXPERT OPINION: In the last decade, phase III trials on novel compounds largely  failed to introduce efficacious pharmacotherapies beyond temozolomide in  glioblastoma. So far, inhibition of angiogenesis by compounds such as  bevacizumab, cediranib, enzastaurin or cilengitide as well as alternative dosing  schedules of temozolomide did not prolong survival, neither at primary diagnosis  nor at recurrent disease. Promising strategies of pharmacotherapy currently  under evaluation represent targeting epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR)  with biomarker-stratified patient populations and immunotherapeutic concepts  including checkpoint inhibition and vaccination. The clinical role of the  medical device delivering 'tumor-treating fields' in newly diagnosed  glioblastoma which prolonged overall survival in a phase III study has remained  controversial. After failure of several phase III trials with previously  promising agents, improvement of concepts and novel compounds are urgently  needed to expand the still limited therapeutic options for the treatment of  glioblastoma."", 'BACKGROUND: glioblastomas are highly vascularized tumors and various  antiangiogenic drugs have been investigated in clinical trials showing unclear  results. We performed a systematic review and a meta-analysis to clarify and  evaluate their effectiveness in glioblastoma patients. PATIENTS AND METHODS: we searched relevant published and unpublished randomized  clinical trials analyzing antiangiogenic drugs versus chemotherapy in  glioblastoma patients from January 2006 to January 2016 in MEDLINE, WEB of  SCIENCE, ASCO, ESMO and SNO databases. RESULTS: fourteen randomized clinical trials were identified (7 with  bevacizumab, 2 cilengitide, 1 enzastaurin, 1 dasatinib, 1 vandetanib, 1  temsirolimus, 1 cediranib) including 4330 patients. Antiangiogenic drugs showed  no improvement in overall survival with a pooled HR of 1.00, a trend for an  inferior outcome, in terms of overall survival, was observed in the group of  patients receiving antiangiogenic drug alone compared to cytotoxic drug alone  (HR=1.24, p=0.056). Bevacizumab did not improve overall survival. Twelve trials  (4113 patients) were analyzed for progression-free survival. Among  antiangiogenic drugs, only bevacizumab demonstrated an improvement of  progression-free survival (HR=0.63, p<0.001), both alone (HR=0.60, p=0.003) or  in combination to chemotherapy (HR=0.63; p<0.001), both as first-line treatment  (HR=0.70, p<0.001) or in recurrent disease (HR=0.52, p<0.001). CONCLUSIONS: antiangiogenic drugs did not improve overall survival in  glioblastoma patients, either as first or second-line treatment, and either as  single agent or in combination with chemotherapy. Among antiangiogenic drugs,  only bevacizumab improved progression-free survival regardless of treatment  line, both as single agent or in combination with chemotherapy.', 'The prognosis of patients with glioblastoma, anaplastic astrocytoma, and  anaplastic oligodendroglioma remains poor despite standard treatment with  radiotherapy and temozolomide. Molecular targeted therapy holds the promise of  providing new, more effective treatment options with minimal toxicity. However,  the development of targeted therapy for gliomas has been particularly  challenging. The oncogenetic process in such tumors is driven by several  signaling pathways that are differentially activated or silenced with both  parallel and converging complex interactions. Therefore, it has been difficult  to identify prevalent targets that act as key promoters of oncogenesis and that  can be successfully addressed by novel agents. Several drugs have been tested,  including epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) tyrosine kinase inhibitors  (gefitinib and erlotinib), mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR) inhibitors  (temsirolimus and everolimus), and vascular endothelial growth factor receptor  (VEGFR), protein kinase C-beta, and other angiogenesis pathways inhibitors  (vatalanib, bevacizumab, and enzastaurin). Although preliminary efficacy results  of most trials in recurrent disease have fallen short on expectations,  substantial advances have been achieved by associated translational research. In  this article, we seek to recapitulate the lessons learned in the development of  targeted therapy for gliomas, including challenges and pitfalls in the  interpretation of preclinical data, specific issues in glioma trial design,  insights provided by translational research, changes in paradigms, and future  perspectives.', 'This open-label, single-arm, phase II study combined enzastaurin with  temozolomide plus radiation therapy (RT) to treat glioblastoma multiforme (GBM)  and gliosarcoma. Adults with newly diagnosed disease and Karnofsky performance  status (KPS) ≥ 60 were enrolled. Treatment was started within 5 weeks after  surgical diagnosis. RT consisted of 60 Gy over 6 weeks. Temozolomide was given  at 75 mg/m(2) daily during RT and then adjuvantly at 200 mg/m(2) daily for 5  days, followed by a 23-day break. Enzastaurin was given once daily during RT and  in the adjuvant period at 250 mg/day. Cycles were 28 days. The primary end point  was overall survival (OS). Progression-free survival (PFS), toxicity, and  correlations between efficacy and molecular markers analyzed from tumor tissue  samples were also evaluated. A prospectively planned analysis compared OS and  PFS of the current trial with outcomes from 3 historical phase II trials that  combined novel agents with temozolomide plus RT in patients with GBM or  gliosarcoma. Sixty-six patients were enrolled. The treatment regimen was well  tolerated. OS (median, 74 weeks) and PFS (median, 36 weeks) results from the  current trial were comparable to those from a prior phase II study using  erlotinib and were significantly better than those from 2 other previous studies  that used thalidomide or cis-retinoic acid, all in combination with temozolomide  plus RT. A positive correlation between O-6-methylguanine-DNA methyltransferase  promoter methylation and OS was observed. Adjusting for age and KPS, no other  biomarker was associated with survival outcome. Correlation of relevant  biomarkers with OS may be useful in future trials.', ""BACKGROUND: This study's primary objective was evaluation of the  progression-free survival rate at 6 months (PFS-6) in patients with newly  diagnosed glioblastoma without O(6)-methylguanine-DNA-methyltransferase (MGMT)  promoter hypermethylation postsurgically treated with enzastaurin before and  concomitantly with radiation therapy, followed by enzastaurin maintenance  therapy. PFS-6 of at least 55% was set to be relevant compared with the data of  the EORTC 26981/22981 NCIC CE.3 trial. METHODS: Adult patients with a life expectancy of at least 12 weeks who were  newly diagnosed with a histologically proven supratentorial glioblastoma without  MGMT promoter hypermethylation were eligible. Patients were treated with  enzastaurin prior to, concomitantly with, and after standard partial brain  radiotherapy. Here we report on a multicenter, open-label, uncontrolled phase II  study of patients with newly diagnosed glioblastoma without MGMT promoter  hypermethylation treated with enzastaurin and radiation therapy within 4 study  periods. RESULTS: PFS-6 was 53.6% (95% confidence interval [CI]: 39.8-65.6). The median  overall survival was 15.0 months (95% CI: 11.9-17.9) for all patients, 3.9  months (95% CI: 0.8-9.0) for patients with biopsy, 15.4 months (95% CI:  10.1-17.9) for patients with partial resection, and 18.9 months (95% CI:  13.9-28.5) for patients with complete resection. The safety profile in this  study was as expected from previous trials, and the therapy was well tolerated. CONCLUSIONS: PFS-6 missed the primary planned outcome of 55%. The secondary  exploratory analysis according to resection status of the different subgroups of  patients with biopsies, partial resection, and complete resection demonstrates  the strong prognostic influence of resection on overall survival."", ""OBJECT: The objective of this study was to report the authors' experience with  the long-term administration of temozolomide (TMZ; > 6 cycles, up to 101) in  patients with newly diagnosed glioblastoma and to analyze its feasibility and  safety as well as its impact on survival. The authors also compared data  obtained from the group of patients undergoing long-term TMZ treatment with data  from patients treated with a standard TMZ protocol. METHODS: A retrospective analysis was conducted of 37 patients who underwent  operations for glioblastoma between 2004 and 2012. Volumetric analysis of  postoperative Gd-enhanced MR images, obtained within 48 hours, confirmed tumor  gross-total resection (GTR) in all but 2 patients. All patients received the  first cycle of TMZ at a dosage of 150 mg/m(2) starting on the second or third  postsurgical day. Afterward, patients received concomitant radiochemotherapy  according to the Stupp protocol. With regard to adjuvant TMZ therapy, the 19  patients in Group A, aged 30-72 years (mean 56.1 years), received 150 mg/m(2)  for 5 days every 28 days for more than 6 cycles (range 7-101 cycles). The 18  patients in Group B, aged 46-82 years (mean 64.8 years), received the same dose,  but for no more than 6 cycles. O(6)-methylguanine-DNA methyltransferase (MGMT)  promoter methylation status was analyzed for both groups and correlated with  overall survival (OS) and progression-free survival (PFS). The impact of age,  sex, Karnofsky Performance Scale score, and Ki 67 staining were also considered. RESULTS: All patients but 1 in Group A survived at least 18 months (range 18-101  months), and patients in Group B survived no more than 17 months (range 2-17  months). The long-term survivors (Group A), defined as patients who survived at  least 12 months after diagnosis, were 51.3% of the total (19/37). Kaplan-Meier  curve analysis showed that patients treated with more than 6 TMZ cycles had OS  and PFS that was significantly longer than patients receiving standard treatment  (median OS 28 months vs 8 months, respectively; p = 0.0001; median PFS 20 months  vs 4 months, respectively; p = 0.0002). By univariate and multivariate Cox  proportional hazard regression analysis, MGMT methylation status and number of  TMZ cycles appeared to be survival prognostic factors in patients with  glioblastoma. After controlling for MGMT status, highly significant differences  related to OS and PFS between patients with standard and long-term TMZ treatment  were still detected. Furthermore, in Group A and B, the statistical correlation  of MGMT status to the number of TMZ cycles showed a significant difference only  in Group A patients, suggesting that MGMT promoter methylation was predictive of  response for long-term TMZ treatment. Prolonged therapy did not confer  hematological toxicity or opportunistic infections in either patient group. CONCLUSIONS: This study describes the longest experience so far reported with  TMZ in patients with newly diagnosed glioblastomas, with as many as 101 cycles,  who were treated using GTR. Statistically significant data confirm that median  survival correlates with MGMT promoter methylation status as well as with the  number of TMZ cycles administered. Long-term TMZ therapy appears feasible and  safe."", 'BACKGROUND: The study investigated if intraoperative use of carmustine wafers,  particularly in combination with Stupp regimen, is a viable and safe first-line  treatment option of glioblastomas. METHODS: Eighty-three consecutive adult patients (50 men; mean age 60 years)  with newly diagnosed supratentorial primary glioblastomas that underwent  surgical resection with intraoperative carmustine wafers implantation (n = 7.1 ±  1.7) were retrospectively studied. RESULTS: The median overall survival (OS) was 15.8 months with 56 patients dying  over the course of the study. There was no significant association between the  number of implanted carmustine wafers and complication rates (four surgical site  infections, one death). The OS was significantly longer in Stupp regimen  patients (19.5 months) as compared with patients with other postoperative  treatments (13 months; p = 0.002). In addition patients with eight or more  implanted carmustine wafers survived longer (24.5 months) than patients with  seven or less implanted wafers (13 months; p = 0.021). Finally, regardless of  the number of carmustine wafers, median OS was significantly longer in patients  with a subtotal or total resection (21.5 months) than in patients with a partial  resection (13 months; p = 0.011). CONCLUSIONS: The intraoperative use of carmustine wafers in combination with  Stupp regimen is a viable first-line treatment option of glioblastomas. The  prognostic value of this treatment association should be evaluated in a  multicenter trial, ideally in a randomized and placebo-controlled one.', 'PURPOSE: A phase II study of temsirolimus was conducted in children and  adolescents with high-grade glioma, neuroblastoma or rhabdomyosarcoma. PATIENTS AND METHODS: Temsirolimus 75 mg/m(2) was administered once weekly until  disease progression or intolerance. Using the Simon 2-stage design, further  enrolment in each disease cohort required ≥ 2 objective responses within the  first 12 weeks for the first 12 evaluable patients (those who received ≥ 3  temsirolimus doses). RESULTS: Fifty-two heavily pretreated patients with relapsed (12%) or refractory  (88%) disease, median age 8 years (range 1-21 years), were enroled and treated.  One patient with neuroblastoma achieved confirmed partial response within the  first 12 weeks; thus, none of the 3 cohorts met the criterion for continued  enrolment. Disease stabilisation at week 12 was observed in 7 of 17 patients  (41%) with high-grade glioma (5 diffuse pontine gliomas, 1 glioblastoma  multiforme and 1 anaplastic astrocytoma), 6 of 19 (32%) with neuroblastoma and 1  of 16 (6%) with rhabdomyosarcoma (partial response confirmed at week 18). In the  three cohorts, median duration of stable disease or better was 128, 663 and 75  d, respectively. The most common treatment-related adverse events were  thrombocytopaenia, hyperlipidaemia and aesthenia. Pharmacokinetic findings were  similar to those observed in adults. CONCLUSIONS: Temsirolimus administered weekly at the dose of 75 mg/m(2) did not  meet the primary objective efficacy threshold in children with high-grade  glioma, neuroblastoma or rhabdomyosarcoma; however, meaningful prolonged stable  disease merits further evaluation in combination therapy.', 'Randomized phase III trials have shown significant improvement of survival 1, 2,  and 3 years after implantation of 1,3-bis (2-chloroethyl)-1-nitrosourea (BCNU)  wafers for patients with newly diagnosed malignant glioma. But these studies and  subsequent non-phase III studies have also shown risks associated with local  chemotherapy within the central nervous system. The introduction of concomitant  radiochemotherapy with temozolomide (TMZ) has later demonstrated a survival  benefit in a phase III trial and has become the current treatment standard for  newly diagnosed malignant glioma patients. Lately, this has resulted in clinical  protocols combining local chemotherapy with BCNU wafers and concomitant  radiochemotherapy with TMZ although this may carry the risk of increased  toxicity. We have compiled the treatment experience of seven neurosurgical  centers using implantation of carmustine wafers at primary surgery followed by 6  weeks of radiation therapy (59-60 Gy) and 75 mg/m(2)/day TMZ in patients with  newly diagnosed glioblastoma followed by TMZ monochemotherapy. We have  retrospectively analyzed the postoperative clinical course, occurrence and  severity of adverse events, progression-free interval, and overall survival in  44 patients with newly diagnosed glioblastoma multiforme. All patients received  multimodal treatment including tumor resection, BCNU wafer implantation, and  concomitant radiochemotherapy. Of 44 patients (mean age 59\u2009±\u200910.8 years) with  glioblastoma who received Gliadel wafer at primary surgery, 28 patients (64%)  had died, 16 patients (36%) were alive, and 15 patients showed no evidence of  clinical or radiographic progression after a median follow-up of 15.6 months. At  time of analysis of adverse events in this patient population, the median  overall survival was 12.7 months and median progression-free survival was 7.0  months. Surgical, neurological, and medical adverse events were analyzed.  Twenty-three patients (52%) experienced adverse events of any kind including  complications that did not require treatment. Nineteen patients (43%)  experienced grade 3 or grade 4 adverse events. Surgical complications included  cerebral edema, healing abnormalities, cerebral spinal fluid leakage,  meningitis, intracranial abscess, and hydrocephalus. Neurological adverse events  included newly diagnosed seizures, alteration of mental status, and new  neurological deficits. Medical complications were thromboembolic events  (thrombosis, pulmonary embolism) and hematotoxicity. Combination of both  treatment strategies, local chemotherapy with BCNU wafer and concomitant  radiochemotherapy, appears attractive in aggressive multimodal treatment  schedules and may utilize the sensitizing effect of TMZ and carmustine on MGMT  and AGT on their respective drug resistance genes. Our data demonstrate that  combination of local chemotherapy and concomitant radiochemotherapy carries a  significant risk of toxicity that currently appears underestimated. Adverse  events observed in this study appear similar to complication rates published in  the phase III trials for BCNU wafer implantation followed by radiation therapy  alone, but further add the toxicity of concomitant radiochemotherapy with  systemic TMZ. Save use of a combined approach will require specific prevention  strategies for multimodal treatments.', 'Current treatment strategies in patients with newly-diagnosed glioblastoma  include surgical resection with post-operative radiotherapy and  concomitant/adjuvant temozolomide (the ""Stupp protocol"") or resection with  implantation of 1,3-bis(2-chloroethyl)-1-nitrosourea (BCNU) wafers in the  surgical cavity followed by radiotherapy. In clinical practice, patients with  malignant glioma treated with BCNU wafer often also receive adjuvant  temozolomide. However, current treatment guidelines are unclear on whether and  how these treatment practices can be combined, and no prospective phase 3 study  has assessed the safety and efficacy of combining BCNU wafers with temozolomide  and radiation in high-grade malignant glioma. The rationale for multimodal  therapy comprising surgical resection with adjunct local BCNU wafers followed by  radiotherapy and temozolomide is based on complementary and synergistic  mechanisms of action between BCNU and temozolomide in preclinical studies; a  shared primary resistance pathway, methylguanine-DNA methyltransferase (MGMT);  and the opportunity to overcome resistance through MGMT depletion to boost  cytotoxic activity. A comprehensive review of the literature identified 19  retrospective and prospective studies investigating the use of this multimodal  strategy. Median overall survival in 14 studies of newly-diagnosed patients  suggested a modest improvement versus resection followed by Stupp protocol or  resection with BCNU wafers, with an acceptable and manageable safety profile.']",No. Enzastaurin does not improve prognosis of glioblastoma patients.
65,Have microRNAs been implicated in pharmacogenomics? ,"[""MicroRNAs (miRNAs) are short regulatory RNAs that down-regulate gene expression.  They are essential for cell homeostasis and active in many disease states. A  major discovery is the ability of miRNAs to determine the efficacy of drugs,  which has given rise to the field of 'miRNA pharmacogenomics' through  'Pharmaco-miRs'. miRNAs play a significant role in pharmacogenomics by  down-regulating genes that are important for drug function. These interactions  can be described as triplet sets consisting of a miRNA, a target gene and a drug  associated with the gene. We have developed a web server which links miRNA  expression and drug function by combining data on miRNA targeting and  protein-drug interactions. miRNA targeting information derive from both  experimental data and computational predictions, and protein-drug interactions  are annotated by the Pharmacogenomics Knowledge base (PharmGKB). Pharmaco-miR's  input consists of miRNAs, genes and/or drug names and the output consists of  miRNA pharmacogenomic sets or a list of unique associated miRNAs, genes and  drugs. We have furthermore built a database, named Pharmaco-miR Verified Sets  (VerSe), which contains miRNA pharmacogenomic data manually curated from the  literature, can be searched and downloaded via Pharmaco-miR and informs on  trends and generalities published in the field. Overall, we present examples of  how Pharmaco-miR provides possible explanations for previously published  observations, including how the cisplatin and 5-fluorouracil resistance induced  by miR-148a may be caused by miR-148a targeting of the gene KIT. The information  is available at www.Pharmaco-miR.org."", 'microRNAs (miRNAs) represent the most abundant class of gene expression  regulators that bind complementarily to transcripts to repress their translation  or mRNA degradation. These small ( 21-23 nucleotides in length) noncoding RNAs  are derived through a multistep process by miRNA genes located in genomic DNA.  Because miRNAs regulate fundamental cellular functions, their dysregulation  affects a large range of physiological processes, such as development, immune  responses, metabolism, and diseases as well as toxicological outcomes.  Cancer-related miRNAs have been extensively studied; however, the roles of  miRNAs in xenobiotic metabolism and in toxicology have only recently been  explored. This review focuses on the current knowledge of miRNA-dependent  regulation of drug-metabolizing enzymes and nuclear receptors and the associated  potential toxicological implications. The potential modulation of  toxicology-related changes in miRNA expression, the role of miRNA in  immune-mediated drug-induced liver injuries, the use of circulating miRNAs in  body fluids as potential toxicological biomarkers, and the link between  miRNA-related pharmacogenomics and adverse drug reactions are highlighted.', 'Pharmacogenomics, toxicogenomics, and small RNA expression analysis are three of  the most active research topics in the biological, biomedical, pharmaceutical,  and toxicological fields. All of these studies are based on gene expression  analysis, which requires reference genes to reduce the variations derived from  different amounts of starting materials and different efficiencies of RNA  extraction and cDNA synthesis. Thus, accurate normalization to one or several  constitutively expressed reference genes is a prerequisite to valid gene  expression studies. Although selection of reliable reference genes has been  conducted in previous studies in several animals and plants, no research has  been focused on pharmacological targets, and very few studies have had a  toxicological context. More interestingly, no studies have been performed to  identify reference genes for small RNA analysis although small RNA, particularly  microRNA (miRNA)-related research is currently one of the fastest-moving topics.  In this study, using MCF-7 breast cancer cells as a model, we employed  quantitative real-time PCR (qRT-PCR), one of the most reliable methods for gene  expression analysis in many research fields, to evaluate and to determine the  most reliable reference genes for pharmacogenomics and toxicogenomics studies as  well as for small RNA expression analysis. We tested the transcriptional  expression of five protein-coding genes as well as five non-coding genes in  MCF-7 cells treated with five different pharmaceuticals or toxicants [paclitaxel  (PTX), gossypol (GOS), methyl jasmonate (JAS), L-nicotine (NIC), and melamine  (mela)] and analyzed the stability of the selected reference genes by four  different methods: geNorm, NormFinder, BestKeeper, and the comparative ΔCt  method. According to our analysis, a protein-coding gene, hTBCA and four  non-coding genes, hRNU44, hRNU48, hU6, and hRNU47, appear to be the most  reliable reference genes for the five chemical treatments. Similar results were  also obtained in dose-response and time-course assays with gossypol (GOS)  treatment. Our results demonstrated that traditionally used reference genes,  such as 18s RNA, β-actin, and GAPDH, are not reliable reference genes for  pharmacogenomics and toxicogenomics studies. In contrast, hTBCA and small RNAs  are more stable during drug treatment, and they are better reference genes for  pharmacogenomics and toxicogenomics studies. To widely use these genes as  reference genes, these results should be corroborated by studies with other  human cell lines and additional drugs classes and hormonal treatments.', ""AIMS: Polymorphisms of genes involved in the pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic  processes underlie the divergent drug responses among individuals. Despite some  successes in identifying these polymorphisms, the candidate gene approach  suffers from insufficient gene coverage whereas the genome-wide association  approach is limited by less than ideal coverage of SNPs in some important genes.  To expand the potential of the candidate approach, we aim to delineate a  comprehensive network of drug-response genes for in-depth genetic studies. MATERIALS & METHODS: Pharmacologically important genes were extracted from  various sources including literatures and web resources. These genes, along with  their homologs and regulatory miRNAs, were organized based on their  pharmacological functions and weighted by literature evidence and confidence  levels. Their coverage was evaluated by analyzing three commercial SNP chips  commonly used for genome-wide association studies: Affymetrix SNP array 6.0,  Illumina HumanHap1M and Illumina Omni. RESULTS: A panel of drug-response genes was constructed, which contains 923  pharmacokinetic genes, 703 pharmacodynamic genes and 720 miRNAs. There are only  16.7% of these genes whose all known SNPs can be directly or indirectly (r(2) >  0.8) captured by the SNP chips with coverage of more than 80%. This is possibly  because these SNPs chips have notably poor performance over rare SNPs and miRNA  genes. CONCLUSION: We have compiled a panel of candidate genes that may be  pharmacologically important. Using this knowledgebase, we are able to  systematically evaluate genes and their variants that govern an individual's  response to a given pharmaceutical therapy. This approach can serve as a  necessary complement to genome-wide associations."", ""BACKGROUND: The function of microRNAs (miRNAs) depends on the binding of miRNAs  to their target sequences in the 3'UTR of messenger RNAs (mRNAs), which enhances  the degradation of mRNAs and consequently, represses their expression. Single  nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) in the miRNA target sequences may affect or  impair the binding of miRNAs. Studies have shown that SNPs in miRNA target sites  (miR-TS-SNPs) have a great influence on diverse biological functions, including  pharmacogenomics and disease susceptibilities in human. METHODS: High-resolution melting (HRM) analysis was applied for investigating  the allele frequencies of 3 miR-TS-SNPs (PLA2G2A, IL-16, and NOD2) in acute  leukemia. We also compared the genotypes of acute lymphoblastic leukemia  patients at initial diagnosis and complete remission. RESULTS: HRM analysis revealed 3 genotypes (both homozygous and heterozygous) in  the 3 miR-TS-SNPs. The allele frequencies of all 3 miR-TS-SNPs were similar in  normal individuals and patients with acute myelogenous leukemia. Most patients  with acute lymphoblastic leukemia had the same genotypes at initial diagnosis  and complete remission. CONCLUSIONS: Large scale scanning of case-control studies for miR-TS-SNPs may  contribute to the investigation of their roles and pathogenesis mechanisms in  human diseases. Our study showed that HRM analysis can be an efficient tool for  studies of miR-TS-SNPs."", 'Single nucleotide polymorphisms in pre‑microRNA (miRNA) may alter miRNA  expression levels or processing and contribute to susceptibility in a wide range  of diseases. The present study aimed to evaluate the possible association  between rs2910164 and rs3746444 of the pre-miRNA (hsa-mir-146a and hsa-mir-499)  polymorphisms and susceptibility to rheumatoid arthritis (RA) in an Iranian  population. This case-control study was performed on 104\xa0patients with RA and  110\xa0healthy individuals. Tetra amplification refractory mutation  system-polymerase chain reaction was used to genotype the hsa-mir-499 rs3746444  and hsa-mir-146a rs2910164 polymorphisms. The hsa-mir-499 rs3746444 polymorphism  was a risk factor for predisposition to RA in codominant [TT vs. TC: odds ratio  (OR), 2.11; 95% confidence interval (CI), 1.08-4.11; p=0.029; TT vs. CC: OR,  3.88; 95% CI, 1.68-8.98; p=0.002], dominant (TT vs. TC-CC: OR, 2.64; 95% CI, 1.48-4.72; p=0.001) and recessive (TC-CC vs. CC: OR,  3.05; 95% CI, 1.36-6.83; p=0.007) tested inheritance models. In addition, the  rs3746444 C allele was a risk factor for RA (OR, 2.49; 95% CI, 1.63-3.81;  p<0.0001). No significant difference was found between the groups concerning the  rs2910164 polymorphism (χ2=0.348, p=0.841). Our findings demonstrated that the  hsa-mir-499 rs3746444, but not mir-146a rs2910164, polymorphism is associated  with an increased RA risk in a sample of the Iranian population. Larger studies  with different ethnicities are required to validate our findings.', 'Despite a large amount of microRNAs (miRNAs) have been validated to play crucial  roles in human biology and disease, there is little systematic insight into the  nature and scale of the potential synergistic interactions executed by miRNAs  themselves. Here we established an integrated parameter synergy score to  determine miRNA synergy, by combining the two mechanisms for miRNA-miRNA  interactions, miRNA-mediated gene co-regulation and functional association  between target gene products, into one single parameter. Receiver operating  characteristic (ROC) analysis indicated that synergy score accurately identified  the gene ontology-defined miRNA synergy (AUC\u200a=\u200a0.9415, p<0.001). Only a very  small portion of the random miRNA-miRNA combinations generated potent synergy,  implying poor expectancy of widespread synergy. However, targeting more key  genes made two miRNAs more likely to act synergistically. Compared to other  miRNAs, miR-21 was a highly exceptional case due to frequent appearance in the  top synergistic miRNA pairs. This result highlighted its essential role in  coordinating or strengthening physiological and pathological functions of other  miRNAs. The synergistic effect of miR-21 and miR-1 were functionally validated  for their significant influences on myocardial apoptosis, cardiac hypertrophy  and fibrosis. The novel approach established in this study enables easy and  effective identification of condition-restricted potent miRNA synergy simply by  concentrating the available protein interactomics and miRNA-target interaction  data into a single parameter synergy score. Our results may be important for  understanding synergistic gene regulation by miRNAs and may have significant  implications for miRNA combination therapy of cardiovascular disease.', ""Extensive research has shown that aberrant expression of microRNAs (miRNAs)  plays an important role in innate and adaptive immune responses. The rs2910164  polymorphism has been identified as a functional variant, which affects the  transcription and expression level of miR-146a and, thereby, contributes to the  pathogenesis of several inflammatory and autoimmune diseases. To investigate  whether the rs2910164 G/C polymorphism was associated with asthma, systemic  lupus erythematosus (SLE) or juvenile rheumatoid arthritis (JRA), we performed  an association study in a pediatric Mexican cohort. We included 979 pediatric  patients (asthma: 402, SLE: 367 and JRA: 210) and 531 control subjects without  inflammatory or immune diseases. Genotyping was performed using the 5'  exonuclease technique. The genotype distribution of the rs2910164 polymorphism  was in Hardy-Weinberg equilibrium in each group. No significant differences were  detected in the distribution of this polymorphism between cases and controls  (P\u2009=\u20090.108, 0.609 and 0.553 for subjects with asthma, JRA and SLE,  respectively). However, stratification by gender showed a statistically  significant difference between asthmatic and control females, where the C allele  was significantly associated with protection to asthma (odds ratio\u2009=\u20090.694, 95%  confidence interval 0.519-0.929, P\u2009=\u20090.0138). Our results provide evidence that  rs2910164 may play a role in the susceptibility to childhood-onset asthma, but  not SLE or JRA in Mexicans. Further association studies may contribute to  determining the role of miR-146a single-nucleotide polymorphisms in  immune-mediated diseases."", ""Pharmacogenetics (PGX) is the study of drug response as a function of an  individual's DNA. PGX is often viewed as an extension of disease association  genetics, and although this information may be related, it is not the study of  drug response. Although medicines are used to treat diseases, the value of  strategies that identify and incorporate DNA biomarkers associated with clinical  efficacy, or DNA biomarkers for untoward clinical responses, can be applied  directly to pharmaceutical pipelines. The growth of adverse event PGX studies  involving marketed medicines generally uses relatively large numbers of affected  patients, but has been productive. However, the two critical strategies for  pipeline genetics must make use of fewer patients: (1) the early identification  of efficacy signals so that they can be applied early in development for  targeted therapies and (2) identification of safety signals that can  subsequently be validated prospectively during development using the least  number of patients with adverse responses. Assumptions are often made that large  numbers of patients are necessary to recognize PGX hypotheses and to validate  DNA biomarkers. In some ways, pipeline pharmacogenetics may be viewed as the  opposite of current genome-wide scanning designs. The goal is to obtain PGX  signals in as few patients as possible, and then validate PGX hypotheses for  specificity and sensitivity as development trials go forward--not using hundreds  of thousand of markers to detect strong linkage disequilibrium signals in  thousands of patients and their controls. Drug development takes 5-7 years for a  drug candidate to traverse to registration--and this is similar to the timeframe  for validating genetic biomarkers using sequential clinical trials. Two  important examples are discussed, the association of APOE genotypes to the  demonstration of actionable efficacy signals for the use of rosiglitazone for  Alzheimer's disease; and the identification of HLA-B(*)5701 as a highly  sensitive and specific predictive marker for abacavir treated patients who will  develop hypersensitivity syndrome (HSS). The rosiglitazone study prevented  pipeline attrition by changing the interpretation of a critical Phase IIB proof  of concept study (2005) from a failed study, to a positive efficacy response in  a genetically predictable proportion of patients. Now, three years later, a  Phase III program of clinical trials using pharmacogenetic designs is months  away from completion (late08). If successfully registered (early09), millions of  patients could benefit, and efficacy PGX would have achieved its first  prospective block-buster. The use of safety candidate gene association genetics  in patients who received abacavir therapy and developed HSS starting in 1998  culminated in a double blind clinical trial that determined sensitivity > 97%  and specificity >99% in 2007. Clinical consensus panels rapidly recommended  abacavir as the preferred therapy along with HLA-B(*)5701 pre-testing,  immediately increasing the market share of abacavir with respect to other  reverse transcriptases that are associated with there own adverse events.  Targeting of medicines during drug development is now possible, practical, and  profitable."", ""Pharmacogenetics and pharmacogenomics are keys to the success of personalized  medicine, prescribing drugs based on a patient's individual genetic and  biological profile. In this review, we will focus on the application of  pharmacogenetics and pharmacogenomics in developing monoclonal antibody (MAb)  therapeutics in oncology. The significance of pharmacogenomics in MAb  therapeutics is highlighted by the association between polymorphisms in Fc  receptors and clinical response to anti-CD20 MAb rituximab (Rituxan) or  anti-ganglioside GD2 MAb 3F8, as well as the potential link between  polymorphisms in HER2 and cardiac toxicity in patients treated with the  anti-HER2 MAb trastuzumab (Herceptin). The dependence on gene copy number or  expression levels of HER2 and epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) for  therapeutic efficacy of trastuzumab and cetuximab (Erbitux), respectively,  supports the importance of selecting suitable patient populations based on their  pharmacogenetic profile. In addition, a better understanding of target mutation  status and biological consequences will benefit MAAb development and may guide  clinical development and use of these innovative therapeutics. The application  of pharmacogenetics and pharmacogenomics in developing MAb therapeutics will be  largely dependent on the discovery of novel surrogate biomarkers and  identification of disease- and therapeutics-relevant polymorphisms. Challenges  and opportunities in biomarker discovery and validation, and in implementing  clinical pharmacogenetics and pharmacogenomics in oncology MAb development and  clinical practice will also be discussed.""]",Yes. MicroRNAs have been implicated in pharmacogenomics.
66,Are piRNAs involved in gene silencing?,"['In the Drosophila germline, retrotransposons are silenced by the  PIWI-interacting RNA (piRNA) pathway. piRNA pathway mutations lead to  overexpression and mobilization of retrotransposons in the germline. In  different organisms, small RNAs were shown to be implicated in the  posttranscriptional degradation of mRNA and/or transcriptional repression of the  homologous locus. In Drosophila, the mechanism of piRNA-mediated silencing is  still far from being understood. Transcriptional silencing implies a  piRNA-mediated formation of repressive chromatin which diminishes the  transcriptional capacity of the target locus. Nuclear Run-On (NRO) assay allows  a direct estimation of the density of transcribing polymerases at specific  genomic regions. Here we describe the NRO protocol on Drosophila ovarian tissues  which can be useful for investigation of the transcriptional silencing in the  female germline.', 'VASA is an evolutionarily conserved RNA helicase essential for germ cell  development. The mouse PIWI family proteins MILI and MIWI2 are involved in  production of Piwi-interacting RNAs (piRNAs) in fetal male germ cells through a  ping-pong amplification cycle. Expression of retrotransposons is elevated in  MILI- and MIWI2-deficient male germ cells due to defective de novo DNA  methylation, which is presumably caused by impaired piRNA expression. Here, we  report that essentially the same abnormalities are observed in MVH (mouse VASA  homolog)-deficient mice. Comprehensive analysis of piRNAs in MVH-deficient fetal  male germ cells showed that MVH plays crucial roles in the early phase of the  ping-pong amplification cycle.', ""Although Piwi proteins and Piwi-interacting RNAs (piRNAs) genetically repress  transposable elements (TEs), it is unclear how the highly diverse piRNA  populations direct Piwi proteins to silence TE targets without silencing the  entire transcriptome. To determine the capacity of piRNA-mediated silencing, we  introduced reporter genes into Drosophila OSS cells, which express microRNAs  (miRNAs) and piRNAs, and compared the Piwi pathway to the Argonaute pathway in  gene regulation. Reporter constructs containing several target sites that were  robustly silenced by miRNAs were not silenced to the same degrees by piRNAs.  However, another set of reporters we designed to enable a large number of both  TE-directed and genic piRNAs to bind were robustly silenced by the PIWI/piRNA  complex in OSS cells. These reporters show that a bulk of piRNAs are required to  pair to the reporter's transcripts and not the reporter's DNA sequence to engage  PIWI-mediated silencing. Following our genome-wide study of PIWI-regulated  targets in OSS cells, we assessed candidate gene elements with our reporter  platform. These results suggest TE sequences are the most direct of PIWI  regulatory targets while coding genes are less directly affected by PIWI  targeting. Finally, our study suggests that the PIWI transcriptional silencing  mechanism triggers robust chromatin changes on targets with sufficient piRNA  binding, and preferentially regulates TE transcripts because protein-coding  transcripts lack a threshold of targeting by piRNA populations. This reporter  platform will facilitate future dissections of the PIWI-targeting mechanism."", 'Proteins of the PIWI subfamily Aub and AGO3 associated with the  germline-specific perinuclear granules (nuage) are involved in the silencing of  retrotransposons and other selfish repetitive elements in the Drosophila genome.  PIWI proteins and their 25- to 30-nt PIWI-interacting RNA (piRNAs) are  considered as key participants of the piRNA pathway. Using immunostaining, we  found a large, nuage-associated organelle in the testes, the piNG-body (piRNA  nuage giant body), which was significantly more massive than an ordinary nuage  granule. This body contains known ovarian nuage proteins, including Vasa, Aub,  AGO3, Tud, Spn-E, Bel, Squ, and Cuff, as well as AGO1, the key component of the  microRNA pathway. piNG-bodies emerge at the primary spermatocyte stage of  spermatogenesis during the period of active transcription. Aub, Vasa, and Tud  are located at the periphery of the piNG-body, whereas AGO3 is found in its  core. Mutational analysis revealed that Vasa, Aub, and AGO3 were crucial for  both the maintenance of the piNG-body structure and the silencing of selfish  Stellate repeats. The piNG-body destruction caused by csul mutations that  abolish specific posttranslational symmetrical arginine methylation of PIWI  proteins is accompanied by strong derepression of Stellate genes known to be  silenced via the piRNA pathway.', 'The Piwi-interacting RNA (piRNA) pathway defends animal genomes against the  harmful consequences of transposable element (TE) infection by imposing  small-RNA-mediated silencing. Because silencing is targeted by TE-derived  piRNAs, piRNA production is posited to be central to the evolution of genome  defense. We harnessed genomic data sets from Drosophila melanogaster, including  genome-wide measures of piRNA, mRNA, and genomic abundance, along with estimates  of age structure and risk of ectopic recombination, to address fundamental  questions about the functional and evolutionary relationships between TE  families and their regulatory piRNAs. We demonstrate that mRNA transcript  abundance, robustness of ""ping-pong"" amplification, and representation in piRNA  clusters together explain the majority of variation in piRNA abundance between  TE families, providing the first robust statistical support for the prevailing  model of piRNA biogenesis. Intriguingly, we also discover that the most  transpositionally active TE families, with the greatest capacity to induce  harmful mutations or disrupt gametogenesis, are not necessarily the most  abundant among piRNAs. Rather, the level of piRNA targeting is largely  independent of recent transposition rate for active TE families, but is rapidly  lost for inactive TEs. These observations are consistent with population genetic  theory that suggests a limited selective advantage for host repression of  transposition. Additionally, we find no evidence that piRNA targeting responds  to selection against a second major cost of TE infection: ectopic recombination  between TE insertions. Our observations confirm the pivotal role of  piRNA-mediated silencing in defending the genome against selfish transposition,  yet also suggest limits to the optimization of host genome defense.', 'In the metazoan germline, piwi proteins and associated piwi-interacting RNAs  (piRNAs) provide a defense system against the expression of transposable  elements. In the cytoplasm, piRNA sequences guide piwi complexes to destroy  complementary transposon transcripts by endonucleolytic cleavage. However, some  piwi family members are nuclear, raising the possibility of alternative pathways  for piRNA-mediated regulation of gene expression. We found that Drosophila Piwi  is recruited to chromatin, colocalizing with RNA polymerase II (Pol II) on  polytene chromosomes. Knockdown of Piwi in the germline increases expression of  transposable elements that are targeted by piRNAs, whereas protein-coding genes  remain largely unaffected. Derepression of transposons upon Piwi depletion  correlates with increased occupancy of Pol II on their promoters. Expression of  piRNAs that target a reporter construct results in a decrease in Pol II  occupancy and an increase in repressive H3K9me3 marks and heterochromatin  protein 1 (HP1) on the reporter locus. Our results indicate that Piwi identifies  targets complementary to the associated piRNA and induces transcriptional  repression by establishing a repressive chromatin state when correct targets are  found.', 'Genetic studies have shown that Aubergine (Aub), one of the Piwi subfamily of  Argonautes in Drosophila, is essential for germ cell formation and maintaining  fertility. aub mutations lead to the accumulation of retrotransposons in ovaries  and testes, and Stellate transcripts in testes. Aub in ovaries associates with a  variety of Piwi-interacting RNAs (piRNAs) derived from repetitive intergenic  elements including retrotransposons. Here we found that Aub in testes also  associates with various kinds of piRNAs. Although in ovaries Aub-associated  piRNA populations are quite diverse, piRNAs with Aub in testes show a strong  bias. The most abundant piRNAs were those corresponding to antisense transcripts  of Suppressor of Stellate [Su(Ste)] genes known to be involved in Stellate gene  silencing. The second most abundant class was made up of those from chromosome X  and showed strong complementarity to vasa transcripts. Immunopurified Aub-piRNA  complexes from testes displayed activity in cleaving target RNA containing  sequences complementary to Stellate and vasa transcripts. These results provide  the first biochemical insights into gene silencing mechanisms mediated by Aub  and piRNAs in fly testes.', 'PIWI-interacting small non-coding RNAs (piRNAs) are genetic and epigenetic  regulatory factors in germline cells, where they maintain genome stability, are  involved in RNA silencing and regulate gene expression. We found that the piRNA  biogenesis and effector pathway are present in human breast cancer (BC) cells  and, analyzing smallRNA-Seq data generated from BC cell lines and tumor  biopsies, we identified >100 BC piRNAs, including some very abundant and/or  differentially expressed in mammary epithelial compared to BC cells, where this  was influenced by estrogen or estrogen receptor β, and in cancer respect to  normal breast tissues. A search for mRNAs targeted by the BC piRNome revealed  that eight piRNAs showing a specific expression pattern in breast tumors target  key cancer cell pathways. Evidence of an active piRNA pathway in BC suggests  that these small non-coding RNAs do exert transcriptional and  post-transcriptional gene regulatory actions also in cancer cells.', 'PIWI clade Argonaute proteins silence transposon expression in animal gonads.  Their target specificity is defined by bound ∼23- to 30-nucleotide (nt)  PIWI-interacting RNAs (piRNAs) that are processed from single-stranded precursor  transcripts via two distinct pathways. Primary piRNAs are defined by the  endonuclease Zucchini, while biogenesis of secondary piRNAs depends on  piRNA-guided transcript cleavage and results in piRNA amplification. Here, we  analyze the interdependencies between these piRNA biogenesis pathways in  developing Drosophila ovaries. We show that secondary piRNA-guided target  slicing is the predominant mechanism that specifies transcripts—including those  from piRNA clusters—as primary piRNA precursors and defines the spectrum of  Piwi-bound piRNAs in germline cells. Post-transcriptional silencing in the  cytoplasm therefore enforces nuclear transcriptional target silencing, which  ensures the tight suppression of transposons during oogenesis. As target slicing  also defines the nuclear piRNA pool during mouse spermatogenesis, our findings  uncover an unexpected conceptual similarity between the mouse and fly piRNA  pathways.', 'The Piwi-interacting RNA (piRNA) pathway defends animal genomes against the  harmful consequences of transposable element (TE) infection by imposing  small-RNA-mediated silencing.

67,Is methotrexate used for the treatment of Rheumatoid Arthritis (RA)?,"['A number of studies show the efficacy of methotrexate (MTX) for rheumatoid  arthritis (RA) in general. However, is there any reason to single this drug out  for early RA? Mechanistically, it probably works differently in RA than in  cancer, at least in part. Thus, in addition to dihydrofolate reductase-related  effects, MTX inhibits aminoimidazocarboxamide transformylase, decreases  leukotriene B4 production, and increases adenosine release at concentrations  achieved with low-dose MTX regimens. Clinically, it is well tolerated over  relatively long periods. Further, a recent meta-analysis of radiology studies  shows that MTX compares favorably with intramuscular gold and is better than  azathioprine. Toxicity remains a concern in treating early RA, particularly as  pulmonary ""hypersensitivity reactions"" continue (1% to 7.6%), infections (both  fungal and perioperative) are documented, and more cirrhosis is found. With all  of the above in mind, the use of MTX seems reasonable but not necessarily  uniformly appropriate and not yet proved for early RA. Studies of MTX in early  RA, particularly in combination with other drugs, are only beginning.', 'We present a case of a 67-year-old Japanese man with a serious oropharyngeal  ulceration that at first seemed to be destructive malignant lymphoma or  oropharyngeal carcinoma. We suspected methotrexate (MTX)-associated  lymphoproliferative disorder (LPD) induced by MTX treatment for rheumatoid  arthritis (RA). About 3 weeks after simple discontinuation of MTX, complete  regression of the disease was observed, confirming our diagnosis.', ""Methotrexate is the most common disease-modifying antirheumatic drug (DMARD)  used in the treatment of rheumatoid arthritis (RA). Current evidence supports  its efficacy in the treatment of RA, resulting in improved short-term disease  control and long-term outcomes in terms of radiographic progression. Oral  methotrexate has traditionally been used first-line due to various reasons,  including ease of administration, low cost and easy availability. A methotrexate  dose of >15 mg/week is generally required for disease control but oral  methotrexate may be only partially effective or poorly tolerated in some  patients. The rationale for using subcutaneous (SC) methotrexate is based on its  improved bioavailability at higher doses and better tolerability in some  patients who have side effects when receiving oral methotrexate. Current  guidance advocates 'treating to target', with the aim of inducing remission in  RA patients. In some patients, this can be achieved using methotrexate alone or  in combination with other traditional DMARDs. Patients who have not responded to  two DMARDs, including methotrexate, are eligible for biological therapy as per  current National Institute for Health and Care Excellence (NICE) guidance in the  UK. Biological treatments are expensive and using SC methotrexate can improve  disease control in RA patients, thus potentially avoiding or delaying the  requirement for future biological treatment."", 'OBJECTIVE: To address the long-term efficacy and toxicity issues related to  methotrexate (MTX) and compare it with other disease-modifying antirheumatic  drugs (DMARDs). METHODS: Review of the international literature on the clinical use of MTX in  rheumatoid arthritis (RA) disease. RESULTS: MTX has emerged as a relatively safe and effective treatment for RA  that compares favorably with other therapies, particularly because of its  considerably longer median drug survival. The toxicity profile of MTX is well  established and includes serious and sometimes fatal liver disease, pneumonitis,  and cytopenias. Hence, regular and careful monitoring of patients taking MTX is  essential, particularly when MTX is combined with other DMARDs. Folate  supplementation can reduce some of the most common side effects of MTX, but it  has not yet been established whether this translates into a reduced risk of  serious disease. Another potential approach to reducing the toxicity of MTX is  therapeutic drug monitoring and dose individualization. However, correlations  between pharmacokinetics and clinical response have been addressed in only a few  studies and with conflicting results. CONCLUSIONS: MTX is an effective DMARD with a relatively safe profile compared  with other therapies. Folate supplementation can significantly reduce the risk  of MTX toxicity. Finally, it is essential that patients be monitored carefully  to reduce the potential serious toxicities of MTX.', 'Methotrexate (MTX) is the anchor treatment for rheumatoid arthritis (RA) and has  been very thoroughly studied in many different patient populations, as  monotherapy and in combination with various other disease modifying  antirheumatic drugs and biologic agents, as they became available. It has a  well-established safety and efficacy profile and is the preferred first line  agent for RA treatment. Historically, oral (PO) preparations of MTX have been  used in the USA with minimal parenteral (subcutaneous, SC, and intramuscular,  IM) administration. Several shortages of drug availability in a parenteral form  have been possibly one of the reasons for this low level of use. Several studies  have looked at the role of parenteral MTX in RA treatment, and these overall  demonstrate better tolerability, bioavailability, and possible efficacy of MTX  compared with PO preparation.', 'Increasingly, methotrexate (MTX) and sulphasalazine (SASP) are used initially  for second-line therapy of rheumatoid arthritis (RA). Although SASP and MTX are  commonly used, the mechanism(s) by which these drugs control the inflammation  that characterizes RA have remained obscure. Results from my laboratory indicate  that these agents share a mode of action; the anti-inflammatory effects of both  SASP and MTX are due, in both in vitro and in vivo studies, to their capacity to  enhance adenosine release at inflamed sites. This mode of action suggests that  the development of agents that directly alter adenosine metabolism may lead to  new, more effective and safer antirheumatic drugs than those currently  available.', 'The association of rheumatoid arthritis (RA) and immune thrombocytopenic purpura  (ITP) has been reported rarely. Methotrexate, which is used for RA treatment,  causes thrombocytopenia. Therefore, in medical practice, physicians avoid using  methotrexate for RA in patients who have both RA and ITP. Here, we report an RA  case that also had ITP, which did not decrease in platelet count after  methotrexate therapy. A 50-year-old woman was diagnosed with diabetes mellitus  in 1990, RA in 1995, and ITP in 2000. She had received hydroxychloroquine for  more than 5 years. She was treated with prednisolone 16 mg/daily between 2006  and 2007, but she discontinued this therapy because of weight gain. Laboratory  findings were not remarkable, except for thrombocytopenia. We started  methotrexate therapy 10 mg per week for treatment of RA, and hydroxychloroquine  therapy was stopped due to nonresponse. The methotrexate dose was increased up  to 15 mg/week. Her complete blood cell count was monitored frequently. We did  not observe any decrease in platelet count, while active arthritis symptoms of  the patient were relieved. This case shows that methotrexate may be used in  patients diagnosed with RA that is associated with ITP under strict monitoring.', 'Methotrexate (MTX) has been the anchor treatment in rheumatoid arthritis (RA)  over the last 15 years, and is used in combination with biologic agents to  enhance efficacy over the last decade or so. The safety profile of MTX has been  studied over 25 years with very few clinically important adverse events in the  weekly low-doses used for RA treatment. The importance of MTX in earlier and  more aggressive management of RA patients cannot be overstated. MTX courses show  some of the longest continuation rates reported in clinical medicine, due to  both effectiveness and safety. The safety profile of MTX indicates that it is  among the safest of any mediation used for the treatment of any arthritis.  Better information on the effectiveness and safety of weekly-low dose MTX should  be communicated to all health professionals involved in the management of RA  patients.', 'Twenty-nine patients participated in a prospective study of the safety and  efficacy of oral methotrexate in the treatment of refractory rheumatoid  arthritis. Patients received a mean dosage of 12.4 mg weekly over a mean  duration of 29.1 months. All patients had liver biopsies at baseline, 2 years,  and annually thereafter. Patients improved significantly by all clinical  measures of efficacy after 1 month; maximum improvement tended to occur after  approximately 6 months of therapy. Radiographs showed improvement of erosive  disease in 7 of 11 patients measured. There was a significant reduction in mean  prednisone dosage. Four patients required an increase in the dosage of  methotrexate after prolonged therapy, because of declining clinical response.  Toxicity was noted at some time in 26 of 29 patients (90%), but reactions  universally became mild and tolerable after adjustment of the dosage. No  significant hepatotoxicity was found in 60 sequential liver biopsies, although  elevated transaminase levels were noted at some time in 20 of 29 patients (70%).', 'PURPOSE OF REVIEW: Dramatic improvement seen in the prognosis of rheumatoid  arthritis has been driven by higher expectations, led by newer drugs and more  intensive use of the older drugs. Although methotrexate has retained its place  as the first-line agent, there has been great interest in comparing biologicals  to conventional Disease Modifying Anti Rheumatic Drugs (DMARDs) over the past  few years with the updated guidelines from both the American College of  Rheumatology and European League Against Rheumatism. We have tried to critically  summarize the findings of some landmark trials that compare these two  approaches. RECENT FINDINGS: Treatment of Early Rheumatoid Arthritis, The Swedish  Pharmacotherapy study and Rheumatoid Arthritis Comparison of Active Therapies  are landmark trials that were designed to compare strategies using biologicals  vs. conventional DMARDs. We will review the safety and efficacy data from these  three trials here and also briefly the important cost differential. CONCLUSION: Methotrexate should be the first-line therapy for most rheumatoid  arthritis patients and will produce the desired results in greater than  one-third of the patients. When methotrexate is not adequate, triple DMARD  therapy should be added which will result in control of approximately another  one-third of the patients. Ultimately, and usually before 1 year of disease, the  remainder of patients will require biological therapies usually added to  conventional DMARDs. There is no evidence that this step-up approach results in  any long-term disadvantage and good evidence that it results in substantial cost  savings.']","Yes, methotrexate is effective for the treatment of Rheumatoid Arthritis.  MTX can be administered in combination with other chemotherapeutic agents or as mono-therapy. Response rate to MTX is more than 90%. MTX therapy is associated with improved survival of RA patients."
68,Which cells express CIDEC protein in humans?,"['White adipose tissue (WAT) functions as an energy reservoir where excess  circulating fatty acids are transported to WAT, converted to triglycerides, and  stored as unilocular lipid droplets. Fat-specific protein 27 (FSP27, CIDEC in  humans) is a lipid-coating protein highly expressed in mature white adipocytes  that contributes to unilocular lipid droplet formation. However, the influence  of FSP27 in adipose tissue on whole-body energy homeostasis remains unclear.  Mice with adipocyte-specific disruption of the Fsp27 gene (Fsp27(ΔAd)) were  generated using an aP2-Cre transgene with the Cre/LoxP system. Upon high-fat  diet feeding, Fsp27(ΔAd) mice were resistant to weight gain. In the small WAT of  these mice, small adipocytes containing multilocular lipid droplets were  dispersed. The expression levels of the genes associated with mitochondrial  abundance and brown adipocyte identity were increased, and basal lipolytic  activities were significantly augmented in adipocytes isolated from Fsp27(ΔAd)  mice compared with the Fsp27(F/F) counterparts. The impaired fat-storing  function in Fsp27(ΔAd) adipocytes and the resultant lipid overflow from WAT led  to marked hepatosteatosis, dyslipidemia, and systemic insulin resistance in  high-fat diet-treated Fsp27(ΔAd) mice. These results demonstrate a critical role  for FSP27 in the storage of excess fat in WAT with minimizing ectopic fat  accumulation that causes insulin-resistant diabetes and non-alcoholic fatty  liver disease. This mouse model may be useful for understanding the significance  of fat-storing properties of white adipocytes and the role of local FSP27 in  whole-body metabolism and estimating the pathogenesis of human partial  lipodystrophy caused by CIDEC mutations.', 'Storage of energy as triglyceride in large adipose-specific lipid droplets is a  fundamental need in all mammals. Efficient sequestration of fat in adipocytes  also prevents fatty acid overload in skeletal muscle and liver, which can impair  insulin signaling. Here we report that the Cide domain-containing protein Cidea,  previously thought to be a mitochondrial protein, colocalizes around lipid  droplets with perilipin, a regulator of lipolysis. Cidea-GFP greatly enhances  lipid droplet size when ectopically expressed in preadipocytes or COS cells.  These results explain previous findings showing that depletion of Cidea with  RNAi markedly elevates lipolysis in human adipocytes. Like perilipin, Cidea and  the related lipid droplet protein Cidec/FSP27 are controlled by peroxisome  proliferator-activated receptor gamma (PPARgamma). Treatment of lean or obese  mice with the PPARgamma agonist rosiglitazone markedly up-regulates Cidea  expression in white adipose tissue (WAT), increasing lipid deposition.  Strikingly, in both omental and s.c. WAT from BMI-matched obese humans,  expression of Cidea, Cidec/FSP27, and perilipin correlates positively with  insulin sensitivity (HOMA-IR index). Thus, Cidea and other lipid droplet  proteins define a novel, highly regulated pathway of triglyceride deposition in  human WAT. The data support a model whereby failure of this pathway results in  ectopic lipid accumulation, insulin resistance, and its associated comorbidities  in humans.', 'The hepatic expression of the cell death-inducing DNA fragmentation factor  A-like effector family (CIDEA, CIDEB, and CIDEC) genes is markedly upregulated  in mouse models of obesity. We evaluated the expression of CIDE genes in liver  of obese human subjects undergoing gastric bypass surgery (GBS), at the time of  surgery and again 1 year later when subjects had lost 37.6 +/- 1.4% of their  initial body weight. At the time of GBS, the expression of CIDEA (r(2) = 0.20, P  = 0.04) and CIDEC (r(2) = 0.32, P = 0.01) was strongly correlated with BMI,  whereas CIDEB was not (r(2) = 0.01, P = 0.81). One year after surgery, CIDEC  expression had declined over 60% (P = 0.02), whereas CIDEA expression did not  change (P = 0.20). These data demonstrate that, consistent with previous studies  conducted in rodents, hepatic expression of CIDEA and CIDEC, but not CIDEB, is  increased in obese humans. Moreover, the hepatic expression of CIDEC is  downregulated by marked weight loss.', 'Cell death-inducing DFFA-like effector c (CIDEC) protein, also known as fat  specific protein 27 (Fsp27), is localized to lipid droplets. CIDEC protein is  required for unilocular lipid droplet formation and optimal energy storage in  addition to controlling lipid metabolism in adipocytes and hepatocytes. Research  found that Ad-36 could induce lipid droplets in the cultured skeletal muscle  cells and this process may be mediated by promoting CIDEC expression. The  content of intermuscular fat is an important index for evaluation of beef  quality, so the CIDEC gene appeared to be a candidate gene for regulation of  intermuscular fat, however similar research for the bovine CIDEC gene is  lacking. This paper examined the tissue expression profile of CIDEC gene in  cattle using real-time RT-PCR to suggest that bovine CIDEC is highly expressed  in adipose tissue. In addition, the Bovine CIDEC gene was cloned and inserted  into the eukaryotic expression vector pET-28a(+), whereupon recombinant bovine  CIDEC protein was induced and identified by Western-blot. A phylogenetic  analysis showed that the animo acid sequence of bovine CIDEC was closer to  mammalian CIDEC than rasorial CIDEC. We found ten single nucleotide  polymorphisms sites (SNPs) in bovine CIDEC gene, of which SNP 2, 3, 4, 6 and 9,  and SNP 8 and 10 were in complete linkage disequilibrium, respectively. SNP 1, 2  and 10 were used in further haplotype studies. Eight different haplotypes were  identified in 973 cattle, of which haplotype 8 predominated with frequencies  ranging from 42.90 to 54.30\xa0%. This research provides a basis for future  functional studies of CIDEC in cattle.', 'Human adipocytes express high levels of two distinct lipid droplet proteins, fat  specific protein 27 (FSP27; also called CIDEC), a member of the CIDE family, and  perilipin1 (PLIN1), a member of the PAT family. Both proteins play a role in fat  metabolism in adipocytes, but how they interact is not known. Our present study  demonstrates that FSP27 and PLIN1 co-localize and interact in cultured human  primary adipocytes. We also found that the C-terminal domain of FSP27, aa  120-220, interacts with PLIN1. Individual expression of exogenous FSP27 or PLIN1  increased triglyceride content and decreased glycerol release (a measure of  lipolysis), but co-expression of both proteins did not further increase  triglyceride content or decrease lipolysis in human adipocytes. However, the  combination of PLIN1 and FSP27 increased the average size of lipid droplets or  caused the formation of unilocular adipocytes. Our data suggest that FSP27  interacts with PLIN1 to regulate lipid droplet size in human adipocytes in a  concerted manner.', 'Storage of energy as triglyceride in large adipose-specific lipid droplets is a  fundamental need in all mammals. Efficient sequestration of fat in adipocytes  also prevents fatty acid overload in skeletal muscle and liver, which can impair  insulin signaling.

We studied mouse models and human tissues to identify molecules associated with  ASH progression and focused on the mouse fat-specific protein 27 (FSP-27)/human  cell death-inducing DFF45-like effector C (CIDEC) protein, which is expressed in  white adipose tissues and promotes formation of fat droplets. METHODS: C57BL/6N mice or mice with hepatocyte-specific disruption of Fsp27  (Fsp27(Hep-/-) mice) were fed the Lieber-Decarli ethanol liquid diet (5%  ethanol) for 10 days to 12 weeks, followed by 1 or multiple binges of ethanol (5  or 6 g/kg) during the chronic feeding. Some mice were given an inhibitor  (GW9662) of peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor γ (PPARG). Adenoviral  vectors were used to express transgenes or small hairpin (sh) RNAs in cultured  hepatocytes and in mice. Liver tissue samples were collected from ethanol-fed  mice or from 31 patients with alcoholic hepatitis (AH) with biopsy-proved ASH  and analyzed histologically and immunohistochemically and by transcriptome,  immunoblotting, and real-time PCR analyses. RESULTS: Chronic-plus-binge ethanol feeding of mice, which mimics the drinking  pattern of patients with AH, produced severe ASH and mild fibrosis. Microarray  analyses revealed similar alterations in expression of many hepatic genes in  ethanol-fed mice and humans with ASH, including up-regulation of mouse Fsp27  (also called Cidec) and human CIDEC. Fsp27(Hep-/-) mice and mice given  injections of adenovirus-Fsp27shRNA had markedly reduced ASH following  chronic-plus-binge ethanol feeding. Inhibition of PPARG and cyclic  AMP-responsive element binding protein H (CREBH) prevented the increases in  Fsp27α and FSP27β mRNAs, respectively, and reduced liver injury in this  chronic-plus-binge ethanol feeding model. Overexpression of FSP27 and ethanol  exposure had synergistic effects in inducing production of mitochondrial  reactive oxygen species and damage to hepatocytes in mice. Hepatic CIDEC mRNA  expression was increased in patients with AH and correlated with the degree of  hepatic steatosis and disease severity including mortality. CONCLUSIONS: In mice, chronic-plus-binge ethanol feeding induces ASH that mimics  some histological and molecular features observed in patients with AH. Hepatic  expression of FSP27/CIDEC is highly up-regulated in mice following  chronic-plus-binge ethanol feeding and in patients with AH; this up-regulation  contributes to alcohol-induced liver damage.', 'FSP27 [cell death-inducing DFFA-like effector c (CIDEC) in humans] is a protein  associated with lipid droplets that downregulates the fatty acid oxidation (FAO)  rate when it is overexpressed. However, little is known about its physiological  role in liver. Here, we show that fasting regulates liver expression of Fsp27 in  a time-dependent manner. Thus, during the initial stages of fasting, a maximal  induction of 800-fold was achieved, whereas during the later phase of fasting,  Fsp27 expression decreased. The early response to fasting can be explained by a  canonical PKA-CREB-CRTC2 signaling pathway because: i) CIDEC expression was  induced by forskolin, ii) Fsp27 promoter activity was increased by CREB, and  iii) Fsp27 expression was upregulated in the liver of Sirt1 knockout animals.  Interestingly, pharmacological (etomoxir) or genetic (Hmgcs2 interference)  inhibition of the FAO rate increases the in vivo expression of Fsp27 during  fasting. Similarly, CIDEC expression was upregulated in HepG2 cells by either  etomoxir or HMGCS2 interference. Our data indicate that there is a kinetic  mechanism of autoregulation between short- and long-term fasting, by which free  FAs delivered to the liver during early fasting are accumulated/exported by  FSP27/CIDEC, whereas over longer periods of fasting, they are degraded in the  mitochondria through the carnitine palmitoyl transferase system.', 'Fat-specific protein 27 (FSP27)/CIDEC was initially identified by its  upregulation in TA1 adipogenesis and is one of three cell death-inducing  DFF45-like effector (CIDE) family proapoptotic proteins. Ectopic expression of  CIDEs promotes apoptosis of mammalian cells. On the other hand, FSP27 has very  recently been illustrated to regulate lipid droplet size and promote lipid  storage in adipocytes. Regulation of endogenous FSP27 expression is unknown. We  assessed the FSP27 transcript level in the well-characterized 3T3-L1 in vitro  adipocyte differentiation model and found its emergence parallels the  adipocyte-enriched transcript adipocyte fatty acid binding protein and stearoyl  Co-A desaturase 1. Furthermore, FSP27 is a differentiation-dependent transcript  in adipogenesis of primary rodent and human preadipocytes and in brown  adipogenesis. The FSP27 transcript is inversely regulated by TNF-alpha and  insulin, consistent with an antilipolytic function. It is nearly abolished with  a 4-h exposure of 3T3-L1 adipocytes to 10 ng/ml TNF-alpha, while treatment with  100 nM insulin increased the FSP27 transcript eightfold. In the latter case  LY-294002 blocked this response, indicating involvement of phosphatidylinositol  3-kinase signals. Northern blot analysis of murine tissues indicated exclusive  expression of FSP27 in white and brown adipose tissue; however, a dramatic  upregulation occurred in the liver of ob/ob mice. Ectopic expression of murine  FSP27 in 293T cells and in 3T3-L1 preadipocytes led to the appearance of key  apoptotic hallmarks and cell death. However, despite the upregulation for FSP27  in adipogenesis, we failed to detect DNA laddering indicative of apoptosis in  3T3-L1 adipocytes. This suggests that adipogenesis is accompanied by decreased  susceptibility to the proapoptotic effects of FSP27. Overall, our findings  support roles for FSP27 in cell death and in adipocyte function.', 'Fat specific protein 27 (FSP27) was originally isolated by screen for genes  specifically expressed in fully differentiated mouse adipocytes. FSP27 and cell  death-inducing DFF45-like effector C (CIDEC), the human homologue of FSP27,  belong to the CIDE family. The FSP27 in adipocytes was recently reported to be a  lipid droplet (LD)-associated protein, that promotes the formation of unilocular  LDs. An FSP27 knockout mouse demonstrated lean phenotypes with atrophic adipose  tissue as a result of high-energy expenditure; this mouse line was also  resistant to diet-induced obesity and insulin resistance. Interestingly, FSP27  was also expressed in the steatoic liver of a type II diabetes model mouse. The  expression of FSP27 was markedly decreased in livers lacking the nuclear  receptor peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor gamma. Forced expression of  FSP27 in hepatocytes in vitro or in vivo led to an increase of LD through  increased triglyceride levels. The current status of the physiological roles of  FSP27/CIDEC in adipose tissue and liver are discussed along with its  significance as a factor involved in the development of metabolic disorders.']","The cell death-inducing DNA fragmentation factor alpha-like effector c (CIDEC) is a lipid droplet-associated protein that promotes intracellular triglyceride (TAG) storage. CIDEC is highly expressed in adipocytes, but undetectable in normal liver. However, its hepatic expression rises during fasting or under genetic or diet-induced hepatosteatosis in patients."
69,Which are the problems associated with the use of PD-L1 as immunotherapy biomarker?,"['Drugs that target the programmed cell death-1 (PD-1) receptor have shown  promising antitumor activity in clinical trials, but it is not clear whether  expression of the ligand PD-L1 is a biomarker for response. Increasingly,  researchers say that PD-L1 expression is just one of many variables that may  affect response to PD-1 blockade.', 'Triple negative breast cancer (TNBC) has an aggressive clinical behaviour, with  a poorer prognosis compared to other subtypes. Recently, tumor-infiltrating  lymphocytes (TILs) have been proposed as a predictive biomarker for a better  clinical outcome and pathological response (pR) after neoadjuvant chemotherapy  (NACT) in TNBC. These data confirm the role of the immune system in the  neoplastic progression and in the response to therapy. We performed a  retrospective analysis of 54 pre-NACT biopsies of TNBC and compared both the  percentage of stromal TILs and the degree of PD-L1 expression with the extent of  pR to standard NACT. A pathological complete response (pCR) was achieved in 35%  of cases. Univariate analysis showed (i) a significant association between PD-L1  expression in ≥25% of neoplastic cells and the achievement of a pCR (p = 0.024);  (ii) a significantly higher frequency of pCR in cases showing ≥50% stromal TILs  (p < 0.001). However in the multivariate analysis only PD-L1 expression on tumor  cells remained significantly associated with pCR (OR = 1,13; 95% CI 1,01-1,27),  suggesting that the expression of this biomarker could be associated with a  subpopulation of TNBC more likely to respond to chemotherapy. These data need to  be confirmed by larger studies.', 'BACKGROUND: Lung cancer is the most common cause of cancer-related death among  males and the second leading cause among females globally. Checkpoint inhibitors  re-engage the immune system to fight cancer. This review evaluates phase III  data on the use of checkpoint inhibitors in the treatment of advanced NSCLC and  addresses PD-L1 expression in predicting efficacy. METHODS: Six phase III clinical trials investigating checkpoint inhibitors for  NSCLC were identified through a search of PubMed (to November 15, 2016) and  conference databases, with findings updated from a directed search of eligible  studies conducted in January 2018. RESULTS: Significant reductions in the risk of death ranging from 27% to 41% and  were observed second-line and beyond. A relationship between PD-L1 expression  and survival was apparent in most trials with optimal benefit for the highest  expression levels (≥50%). Benefit was also observed at low or no PD-L1  expression levels and in third-line in some studies. Significantly improved PFS  was observed for pembrolizumab at high PD-L1 expression levels (≥50%)  first-line. Immune-related adverse events associated with checkpoint inhibitors  are tolerable and rates of pneumonitis may be lower among PD-L1 inhibitors. Use  of checkpoint inhibitors for tumors with driver mutations should only be  considered after all appropriate targeted therapy and chemotherapy have been  exhausted. PD-L1 testing presents a valuable tool to guide treatment sequencing  and we recommend use of agent-specific PD-L1 tests and respective scoring  systems until a standardized, convenient and broadly applicable test is  identified. CONCLUSIONS: Checkpoint inhibitors represent a major advance in the treatment of  advanced NSCLC and PD-L1 status can inform treatment decisions.', 'AIM: The treatment of non-small-cell lung cancer has changed after the  development of the immune checkpoint inhibitors. Although the most studied  biomarker is PD-L1 expression, its clinical significance is still debatable. In  this article, we show the updated survival analysis of all published data. METHODS: We searched in network and conference data sources for relevant  clinical studies of immunotherapy for non-small-cell lung cancer that assessed  the PD-L1 expression even as an exploratory analysis. The updated survival  hazard ratios (HR) were included in the analysis. RESULTS: 14 studies with 2857 patients were included (2019 treated with  immunotherapy). The response rate was as higher among PD-L1-positive patients  (RR: 2.19, 95% CI: 1.63-2.94). PD-L1 expression was also related to better  progression-free survival (HR: 0.69, 95% CI: 0.57-0.85) and better overall  survival (HR: 0.77, 95% CI: 0.67-0.89). CONCLUSION: PD-L1 overexpression predicts activity as well as better survival  for patients treated with immune checkpoint inhibitors.', 'BACKGROUND: Carcinosarcomas of the gynecologic tract, also known as malignant  mixed Müllerian tumors, are aggressive neoplasms with a high recurrence rate and  poor prognosis. Despite advances in adjuvant therapies in recent years, the  prognosis of these tumors has not improved. In fact, there are currently no  consensus guidelines for the treatment of these neoplasms and the search for  targetable biomarkers has not been successful so far. Programmed death-ligand 1  (PD-L1) has emerged as a potential target for therapeutics in a number of  malignant tumors, including melanoma, lung, and colorectal cancer. In normal  conditions, PD-L1 is thought to promote immune homeostasis via a number of  pathways, but mainly through downregulation of cytotoxic T cells. In some human  neoplasms, however, overexpression of PD-L1 by tumor cells has been observed,  which can modulate the immune system to allow cancer cells to evade host  response. As this marker could potentially be a therapeutic target for these  tumors, the immunohistochemical expression of PD-L1 in a group of  carcinosarcomas was evaluated in the present study. MATERIAL AND METHODS: Twenty-nine cases of gynecologic carcinosarcomas were  analyzed, corresponding to tumors originating from the uterus (25), ovary (2),  fallopian tube (1), and pelvic epithelium (1). Immunohistochemistry for PD-L1  was performed on paraffin sections and the staining results were assessed  semiquantitatively in both epithelial and mesenchymal components of each tumor. RESULTS: Positive membranous staining for PD-L1 was detected in 25/29 tumors  (86%). The epithelial components were strongly positive in 19/29 (65%) and  weakly positive in 6/29 tumors (21%). The mesenchymal elements were strongly  positive in 8/29 (27%) and weakly positive in 3/29 tumors (10%). With exception  of 1, all tumors with positive sarcomatous components had staining of the  carcinomatous element. Four tumors were negative for PD-L1 in both components. CONCLUSIONS: This study shows that PD-L1 is expressed by the majority of  carcinosarcomas, predominantly in the epithelial components. This is  particularly important as most locoregional recurrences and distant metastases  are of epithelial origin. This finding may serve as a basis for possible  therapeutic approaches using antibodies that have already shown significant  value in a number of other malignant tumors.', 'The sixth ""Melanoma Bridge Meeting"" took place in Naples, Italy, December  1st-4th, 2015. The four sessions at this meeting were focused on: (1) molecular  and immune advances; (2) combination therapies; (3) news in immunotherapy; and  4) tumor microenvironment and biomarkers. Recent advances in tumor biology and  immunology has led to the development of new targeted and immunotherapeutic  agents that prolong progression-free survival (PFS) and overall survival (OS) of  cancer patients. Immunotherapies in particular have emerged as highly successful  approaches to treat patients with cancer including melanoma, non-small cell lung  cancer (NSCLC), renal cell carcinoma (RCC), bladder cancer, and Hodgkin\'s  disease. Specifically, many clinical successes have been using checkpoint  receptor blockade, including T cell inhibitory receptors such as cytotoxic  T-lymphocyte-associated antigen 4 (CTLA-4) and the programmed cell death-1  (PD-1) and its ligand PD-L1. Despite demonstrated successes, responses to  immunotherapy interventions occur only in a minority of patients. Attempts are  being made to improve responses to immunotherapy by developing biomarkers.  Optimizing biomarkers for immunotherapy could help properly select patients for  treatment and help to monitor response, progression and resistance that are  critical challenges for the immuno-oncology (IO) field. Importantly, biomarkers  could help to design rational combination therapies. In addition, biomarkers may  help to define mechanism of action of different agents, dose selection and to  sequence drug combinations. However, biomarkers and assays development to guide  cancer immunotherapy is highly challenging for several reasons: (i) multiplicity  of immunotherapy agents with different mechanisms of action including  immunotherapies that target activating and inhibitory T cell receptors (e.g.,  CTLA-4, PD-1, etc.); adoptive T cell therapies that include tissue infiltrating  lymphocytes (TILs), chimeric antigen receptors (CARs), and T cell receptor (TCR)  modified T cells; (ii) tumor heterogeneity including changes in antigenic  profiles over time and location in individual patient; and (iii) a variety of  immune-suppressive mechanisms in the tumor microenvironment (TME) including T  regulatory cells (Treg), myeloid derived suppressor cells (MDSC) and  immunosuppressive cytokines. In addition, complex interaction of tumor-immune  system further increases the level of difficulties in the process of biomarkers  development and their validation for clinical use. Recent clinical trial results  have highlighted the potential for combination therapies that include  immunomodulating agents such as anti-PD-1 and anti-CTLA-4. Agents targeting  other immune inhibitory (e.g., Tim-3) or immune stimulating (e.g., CD137)  receptors on T cells and other approaches such as adoptive cell transfer are  tested for clinical efficacy in melanoma as well. These agents are also being  tested in combination with targeted therapies to improve upon shorter-term  responses thus far seen with targeted therapy. Various locoregional  interventions that demonstrate promising results in treatment of advanced  melanoma are also integrated with immunotherapy agents and the combinations with  cytotoxic chemotherapy and inhibitors of angiogenesis are changing the evolving  landscape of therapeutic options and are being evaluated to prevent or delay  resistance and to further improve survival rates for melanoma patients\'  population. This meeting\'s specific focus was on advances in immunotherapy and  combination therapy for melanoma. The importance of understanding of melanoma  genomic background for development of novel therapies and biomarkers for  clinical application to predict the treatment response was an integral part of  the meeting. The overall emphasis on biomarkers supports novel concepts toward  integrating biomarkers into personalized-medicine approach for treatment of  patients with melanoma across the entire spectrum of disease stage. Translation  of the knowledge gained from the biology of tumor microenvironment across  different tumors represents a bridge to impact on prognosis and response to  therapy in melanoma. We also discussed the requirements for pre-analytical and  analytical as well as clinical validation process as applied to biomarkers for  cancer immunotherapy. The concept of the fit-for-purpose marker validation has  been introduced to address the challenges and strategies for analytical and  clinical validation design for specific assays.', 'INTRODUCTION: The prominent immune checkpoint molecule, programmed cell death  ligand-1 (PD-L1), is the object of increasing attention. Here, we report a  meta-analysis investigating the safety and efficacy of durvalumab (MEDI4736), an  inhibitor of PD-L1, in various solid tumors. METHODS: A systematic search of PubMed, Embase, and related articles was  performed. Safety data were analyzed using Comprehensive Meta-Analysis software  program version 2. Ultimately, 17 studies with 1,529 patients were included in  our analysis. RESULTS: The major adverse events associated with durvalumab were pruritus and  fatigue, while pruritus, increased alanine transaminase, and increased aspartate  aminotransferase were common among patients treated with a combination of  durvalumab and tremelimumab. Higher PD-L1 expression was associated with a  superior objective response rate. CONCLUSION: Durvalumab is safe in patients with many solid cancers and, in  combination with tremelimumab, it has a tolerable safety profile and is  associated with improved prognosis. PD-L1 expression is a biomarker of the  efficacy of durvalumab.', 'PURPOSE: Promising results in the treatment of non-small cell lung cancer  (NSCLC) have been seen with agents targeting immune checkpoints, such as  programmed cell death 1 (PD-1) or programmed death ligand-1 (PD-L1). However,  only a select group of patients respond to these interventions. The  identification of biomarkers that predict clinical benefit to immune checkpoint  blockade is critical to successful clinical translation of these agents. METHODS: We conducted an integrated analysis of three independent large  datasets, including The Cancer Genome Atlas of lung adenocarcinoma and two  datasets from MD Anderson Cancer Center (Houston, TX), Profiling of Resistance  Patterns and Oncogenic Signaling Pathways in Evaluation of Cancers of the Thorax  (named PROSPECT) and Biomarker-Integrated Approaches of Targeted Therapy for  Lung Cancer Elimination (named BATTLE-1). Comprehensive analysis of mRNA gene  expression, reverse-phase protein array, IHC, and correlation with clinical data  were performed. RESULTS: Epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT) is highly associated with an  inflammatory tumor microenvironment in lung adenocarcinoma, independent of tumor  mutational burden. We found immune activation coexistent with elevation of  multiple targetable immune checkpoint molecules, including PD-L1, PD-L2, PD-1,  TIM-3, B7-H3, BTLA, and CTLA-4, along with increases in tumor infiltration by  CD4(+)Foxp3(+) regulatory T cells in lung adenocarcinomas that displayed an EMT  phenotype. Furthermore, we identify B7-H3 as a prognostic marker for NSCLC. CONCLUSIONS: The strong association between EMT status and an inflammatory tumor  microenvironment with elevation of multiple targetable immune checkpoint  molecules warrants further investigation of using EMT as a predictive biomarker  for immune checkpoint blockade agents and other immunotherapies in NSCLC and  possibly a broad range of other cancers.

METHODS: Tumor samples from 65 patients with mesothelioma were evaluated for  PD-L1 expression by immunohistochemistry, and its prognostic significance was  examined. Malignant effusions from patients with pleural and peritoneal  mesothelioma were evaluated for PD-1-positive and PD-L1-positive infiltrating  lymphocytes and their role in inducing PD-L1 expression in tumor cells.  Antibody-dependent cellular cytotoxicity (ADCC) of avelumab, a fully humanized  immunoglobulin G1 anti PD-L1 antibody against primary mesothelioma cell lines,  was evaluated in presence of autologous and allogeneic natural killer cells. RESULTS: Of 65 pleural and peritoneal mesothelioma tumors examined, 41 (63%)  were PD-L1-positive, which was associated with slightly inferior overall  survival compared to patients with PD-L1-negative tumors (median 23.0 versus  33.3 months, p\xa0= 0.35). The frequency of PD-L1 expression was similar in  patients with pleural and peritoneal mesothelioma, with 62% and 64% of samples  testing positive, respectively. In nine mesothelioma effusion samples evaluated,  the fraction of cells expressing PD-L1 ranged from 12% to 83%. In seven patients  with paired malignant effusion and peripheral blood mononuclear cell (PBMC)  samples, PD-L1 expression was significantly higher on CD3-positive T cells  present in malignant effusions as compared with PBMCs (p\xa0= 0.016). In addition,  the numbers of CD14-positive PD-1-positive cells were increased in malignant  effusions compared with PBMCs (p\xa0= 0.031). The lymphocytes present in malignant  effusions recognized autologous tumor cells and induced interferon-γ-mediated  PD-L1 expression on the tumor cell surface. Of the three primary mesothelioma  cell lines tested, two were susceptible to avelumab-mediated ADCC in the  presence of autologous natural killer cells. CONCLUSIONS: Most pleural as well as peritoneal mesotheliomas express PD-L1.  Malignant effusions in this disease are characterized by the presence of tumor  cells and CD3-positive T cells that highly express PD-L1. In addition,  mesothelioma tumor cells are susceptible to ADCC by the anti-PD-L1 antibody  avelumab.', ""Programmed death-1 receptor (PD-1)/its ligand (PD-L1) antibodies have changed  the landscape in oncology in 2013. The most mature results have been obtained in  advanced melanoma patients. They indicate important response rates and high  quality responses or prolonged duration. Also in renal cancer and in lung cancer  remarkable activity has been demonstrated. Thus it is clear that these  antibodies have a very broad potential and trials in many tumour types are being  initiated. Breaking tolerance at the tumour site is a potent phenomenon and the  potential for synergy with other checkpoint inhibitors such as ipilimumab have  also been demonstrated in 2013. Long term tumour control now seems achievable  and thus the concept of a clinical cure is emerging by modulation of the immune  system. These antibodies bring immunotherapy to the forefront and indicate that  immune-modulation will be a key component of therapeutic strategies from now on.  Because of all these reasons PD-1/PD-L1 antibodies are considered 'drug of the  year'.""]","The use of PD-L1 (B7-H1) immunohistochemistry (IHC) as a predictive biomarker is confounded by multiple unresolved issues: variable detection antibodies, differing IHC cutoffs, tissue preparation, processing variability, primary versus metastatic biopsies, oncogenic versus induced PD-L1 expression, and staining of tumor versus immune cells"
70,Is tirilazad effective for treatment of aneurysmal subarachnoid haemorrhage?,"['Tirilazad mesylate, a nonglucocorticoid 21-aminosteroid, has been shown in  experimental models to reduce vasospasm following subarachnoid hemorrhage (SAH)  and to reduce infarct size from focal cerebral ischemia. To test whether  treatment with tirilazad would reduce ischemic symptoms from vasospasm and  improve overall outcome in patients with ruptured aneurysms, a prospective  randomized, double-blind, vehicle-controlled trial was conducted at 41  neurosurgical centers in Europe, Australia, and New Zealand. One thousand  twenty-three patients were randomly assigned to receive 0.6, 2, or 6 mg/kg per  day of intravenously administered tirilazad or a placebo containing the citrate  vehicle. All patients were also treated with intravenously administered  nimodipine. Patients receiving 6 mg/kg per day of tirilazad had reduced  mortality (p = 0.01) and a greater frequency of good recovery on the Glasgow  Outcome Scale 3 months after SAH (p = 0.01) than similar patients treated with  vehicle. There was a reduction in symptomatic vasospasm in the group that  received 6 mg/kg per day tirilazad; however, the difference was not  statistically significant (p = 0.048). The benefits of treatment with tirilazad  were predominantly shown in men rather than in women. There were no material  differences between the outcomes in the groups treated with 0.6 and 2 mg/kg  tirilazad per day and the group treated with vehicle. Tirilazad was well  tolerated at all three dose levels. These observations suggest that tirilazad  mesylate, at a dosage of 6 mg/kg per day, is safe and improves overall outcome  in patients (especially in men) who have experienced an aneurysmal SAH.', ""The 21-aminosteroid lipid-peroxidation inhibitor, tirilazad mesylate (U-74006F),  recently was shown in a large multinational Phase III clinical trial to decrease  mortality and improve neurological recovery in patients 3 months after onset of  aneurysmal subarachnoid hemorrhage (SAH). A major tirilazad metabolite in  animals and man, U-89678 is formed when the 4-5 double bond in the A-ring is  reduced and has been postulated to contribute significantly to tirilazad's  neuroprotective effects. In the first experiment of the present study, the  authors compared the effects of tirilazad and U-89678 on acute blood-brain  barrier (BBB) damage in rats subjected to SAH via injection of 300 microliters  of autologous nonheparinized blood under the dura of the left cortex. The rats  were treated by intravenous administration of either 0.3 or 1.0 mg/kg of  tirilazad or U-89678 10 minutes before and 2 hours after SAH, and BBB damage was  quantified according to the extravasation of the protein-bound Evans' blue dye  into the injured cortex 3 hours post-SAH. The results revealed that 0.3 and 1.0  mg/kg tirilazad significantly reduced SAH-induced BBB damage 35.2% (p < 0.05)  and 60.6% (p < 0.0001), respectively, in comparison to treatment with vehicle.  The 0.3- and 1.0-mg/kg doses of U-89678 also decreased injury by 39.1% (p <  0.05) and 21.3% (not significant), respectively. In the second experiment, the  investigators assessed the relative abilities of tirilazad and U-89678 to  protect cultured neurons from iron-induced lipid peroxidative injury. Fetal  mouse spinal cord cells were pretreated with 3, 10, or 30 microM tirilazad or  U-89678 for 1 hour and then exposed to 200 microM ferrous ammonium sulfate (FAS)  for 40 minutes. Cell viability was measured in terms of the uptake of  [3H]alpha-(methyl)-aminoisobutyric acid 45 minutes after the FAS treatment. Both  compounds enhanced neuronal survival in a concentration-dependent fashion.  Although the two were equally efficacious, U-89678 was slightly more potent than  its parent. On the basis of these findings, the authors conclude that the  tirilazad metabolite, U-89678, possesses vaso- and neuroprotective properties  that are essentially equivalent to the parent 21-aminosteroid. Hence, U-89678  probably contributes to the protective effects of tirilazad in SAH and other  insults to the central nervous system."", 'To test the safety and efficacy of tirilazad mesylate, a nonglucocorticoid  21-aminosteroid, in improving the outcome of patients with aneurysmal  subarachnoid hemorrhage (SAH), 902 patients were enrolled in a prospective  randomized, double-blind, vehicle-controlled trial at 54 North American  neurosurgical centers. Five patients were excluded prior to receiving any study  drug. Of 897 patients who received at least one dose of study medication, 300  received a placebo containing a citrate vehicle, 298 received 2 mg/kg per day  tirilazad, and 299 received 6 mg/kg per day tirilazad, all administered  intravenously beginning within 48 hours of the SAH and continuing through 10  days posthemorrhage. All patients were also treated with orally administered  nimodipine. At 3 months post-SAH, there were no significant differences (p <  0.025) among the groups with regard to mortality rate, favorable outcome on the  Glasgow Outcome Scale, or employment status. During the first 14 days after the  SAH, there were no significant differences among the groups in the incidence or  severity of clinically symptomatic or angiographically identifiable cerebral  vasospasm. Mortality data stratified by gender and neurological grade on  admission (assessed according to a modified World Federation of Neurological  Surgeons scale) demonstrated that the men with Grades IV to V had a 33%  mortality rate in the vehicle group, 52% in the 2 mg/kg per day tirilazad group  (p = 0.29), and 5% in the 6 mg/kg per day tirilazad group (p = 0.03). Tirilazad  was well tolerated at both dose levels. Tirilazad mesylate at dosage levels of  up to 6 mg/kg per day for 8 to 10 days following SAH did not improve the overall  outcome in patients with aneurysmal SAH in this trial. The differences in the  efficacy of tirilazad in this trial and a previously reported trial in Europe,  Australia, and New Zealand, in which dosage levels of tirilazad of 6 mg/kg per  day reduced mortality rates and increased good recovery, may be a result of  differences in admission characteristics of the patients and/or differences in  management protocols, including the use of anticonvulsant medications.', 'Tirilazad mesylate, a nonglucocorticoid 21-aminosteroid, has been used in two  randomized, double-blind, vehicle-controlled trials in Europe, Australia, New  Zealand, and in North America in patients with aneurysmal subarachnoid  hemorrhage. The first trial has been concluded, enrolled 1023 patients, and  demonstrated a dramatic reduction in mortality from 27% to 3% (p = 0.01) in  males receiving 6 mg/kg/day tirilazad for 10 days, when compared to  vehicle-treated patients. There was also a less incidence of symptomatic  vasospasm, and the frequency of hypertensive-hypervolemic-hemodilution therapy  was significantly reduced. The reduction in mortality rate was remarkable,  however the benefits of treatment with tirilazad were predominantly shown in men  rather than in women. This clinical trial suggest that tirilazad mesylate, at a  dosage of 6 mg/kg/day, improves overall outcome in aneurysmal subarachnoid  hemorrhage patients. Further data from the North America trial and the trial in  women receiving higher doses of tirilazad are still pending.', 'OBJECT: Findings from previous multicenter clinical trials have suggested that  tirilazad mesylate, a synthetic nonhormonal 21-aminosteroid, might be effective  in preventing delayed cerebral ischemia following subarachnoid hemorrhage (SAH).  This beneficial effect, however, was greater in males than females, possibly  because of gender-related pharmacokinetic differences. The authors sought to  assess the effects of administering a larger dose of tirilazad in women with  SAH. METHODS: To test the efficacy of a higher tirilazad mesylate dose in female  patients, a prospective randomized, double-blind, vehicle-controlled trial was  conducted at 56 neurosurgical centers in Europe, Australia, New Zealand, and  South Africa. Eight hundred nineteen patients were randomly assigned to receive  either 15 mg/kg/day of tirilazad mesylate or a placebo containing the citrate  vehicle. The two groups were similar in prognostic factors for delayed cerebral  ischemia and overall outcome. High-dose tirilazad appeared to be well tolerated  because no differences in the incidence of untoward medical events were noted  between the two groups. Medical and surgical interventions were no different in  the two treatment groups except for hyperdynamic therapy (intentional  hypervolemia, induced hypertension, and/or hemodilution), which was more often  used in the placebo-treated group to counteract symptomatic vasospasm (24% of  patients given placebo compared with 18% of patients given tirilazad, p = 0.02).  Mortality rates and overall outcome, assessed using the Glasgow Outcome Scale at  3 months post-SAH, were not different between the two groups, despite a  significantly lower incidence of delayed cerebral ischemia in patients given  tirilazad. Post hoc subgroup analysis by neurological grade also did not reveal  significant differences in outcome, although a trend toward a lower mortality  rate favoring the study drug was present in patients with neurological Grade IV  and V at admission (32% compared with 37%). Symptomatic vasospasm occurred in  33.7% of the placebo-treated patients as opposed to 24.8% of the patients who  were given tirilazad (p = 0.005). The severity of symptomatic vasospasm was also  attenuated by administration of the study drug (severe symptomatic vasospasm was  reported in 11% of the placebo-treated patients compared with 6% of patients in  the tirilazad-treated group (p = 0.008). Clinical cerebral infarction from  vasospasm was also reduced from 13% in the vehicle-treated group to 8% in the  tirilazad-treated group (p < 0.04). CONCLUSIONS: The authors conclude that high-dose tirilazad mesylate is well  tolerated in women with aneurysmal SAH. Although a significant reduction in the  incidence of symptomatic vasospasm was observed in the treatment group, the  primary end point (mortality rate at 3 months post-SAH) was not affected by the  study drug. The use of other potentially effective rescue therapies (that is,  hypervolemia, hemodilution, and induced hypertension) to counteract vasospasm  may have been responsible for these contrasting observations between the two  groups.', ""BACKGROUND: Corticosteroids, particularly dexamethasone, are commonly used for  treatments in patients with subarachnoid haemorrhage (SAH) and primary  intracerebral haemorrhage (PICH) despite the lack of evidence. OBJECTIVES: This review aimed: (1) to determine whether corticosteroid therapy  reduces the proportion of patients who die or have a poor outcome at one to six  months after the onset of SAH or PICH; (2) to determine whether corticosteroid  therapy reduces the frequency of delayed cerebral ischaemia (DCI) in patients  with SAH; (3) to determine the frequency of adverse effects of corticosteroid  therapy in patients with SAH or PICH within six months of the onset of the  event. SEARCH STRATEGY: We searched the Cochrane Stroke Group Trials Register (last  searched November 2003). In addition, we searched MEDLINE (1966 to March 2004)  and EMBASE (1980 to March 2004), and searched reference lists of relevant  studies identified. We also made an attempt to identify any relevant ongoing and  published or unpublished studies by contacting trialists and pharmaceutical  companies. SELECTION CRITERIA: We sought to identify all randomised or quasi-randomised  clinical trials of corticosteroid therapy, in patients with SAH or PICH, that  have a placebo or standard strategy arm as control. Patients of any age and  either gender with clinically (bed-side) diagnosed PICH and cerebrospinal fluid  documented SAH were included in the analysis. The data were analysed both  separately and combined for computed tomography (CT)/magnetic resonance imaging  (MRI)/autopsy/angiography verified patients. DATA COLLECTION AND ANALYSIS: Data extracted from eligible clinical trials  included: (1) death and poor outcome (death, severe disability, or vegetative  state) within the first one to six months of the event onset (primary outcomes);  (2) development of delayed cerebral ischaemia (as defined by the trialists) in  patients with SAH; and (3) adverse effects of the treatment during the scheduled  treatment or follow-up period (secondary outcomes). A pooled estimate of the  effect size was computed, and the test for heterogeneity between trial results  was carried out using The Cochrane Collaboration's Review Manager software,  RevMan 4.2. Intention-to-treat analysis was carried out whenever possible. MAIN RESULTS: Eight trials that fulfilled the eligibility criteria were  identified, with a total of 256 randomised patients in three SAH trials, and 206  patients in five PICH trials. The studies differed substantially with regard to  the study populations and drugs, and methodological quality. The number of  patients allocated to either hydrocortisone or fludrocortisone acetate treatment  in patients with SAH, or to dexamethasone treatment in patients with PICH, was  too small to make any definitive conclusions (confidence intervals were wide for  any of the outcome estimates). AUTHORS' CONCLUSIONS: Overall, there is no evidence of a beneficial or adverse  effect of corticosteroids in patients with either SAH or PICH. Confidence  intervals are wide and include clinically significant effects in both  directions."", 'INTRODUCTION: Cerebral vasospasm in aneurysmal subarachnoid hemorrhage (SAH) is  associated with poor outcome. The safety and feasibility of continuous high-dose  intravenous magnesium sulfate (MgSO4) for the prevention of cerebral vasospasm  and ischemic cerebral injury has not been well studied. METHODS: Patients presenting to our center within 72 hours of aneurysmalSAH  (confirmed by computed tomography [CT] scanning and cerebral angiography)  between June 2001 and October 2002 were enrolled in a prospective pilot study in  which they received MgSO4 as an adjunct to standard SAH management. Study  patients received an intravenous infusion of 12 g of MgSO4 in a 500-mL solution  of 0.9% NaCl administered at a rate of 4.06 mM (or 0.5 g) every hour over a  24-hour period for 10 days to achieve a target predetermined serum Mg range of  more than 1.5 to less than 4.0 mM/L. The effect of MgSO4 on clinical  examination, heart rate, and blood pressure was measured every 2 hours; serum  glucose and phenytoin levels were monitored daily. Outcome measures included  evidence of vasospasm on clinical examination, transcranial Doppler study  ((TCD); velocity >or=100 cm/s), or repeat cerebral angiogram obtained within 10  days of SAH; and Glasgow Outcome Scale (GOS) score assessment and CT scan  evidence of ischemic infarction at 30 days. RESULTS: Nineteen patients (mean age: 55 years; range: 39-84 years; 11 males, 8  females) were enrolled in the study. Presenting Hunt Hess grade was II or  higher; mean Fisher grade was 3. Vasospasm was observed in nine patients (by  clinical examination in two, TCD in five, and angiogram in nine). The mean serum  Mg level was 2.7 mM/L (standard deviation: +/- 0.37) and was maintained during  the infusion period. No clinical adverse effects, hemodynamic changes, or  fluctuations in serum glucose or phenytoin levels were observed. None of the  patients died; no CT evidence of ischemic infarction was present; and most had  good outcomes (GOS 5 in 10 patients; GOS 4 in 8 patients). CONCLUSION: Our study confirmed the safety and feasibility of a continuous  infusion of high-dose intravenous MgSO4 in patients with aneurysmal SAH.  Randomized controlled trials are required to confirm the promising results.', 'BACKGROUND: There has been longstanding controversy over the use of magnesium  sulfate infusion in the medical management of aneurysmal subarachnoid hemorrhage  (SAH). Several clinical trials evaluating the beneficial effects of magnesium on  cerebral vasospasm and their poor outcome have been published. However, results  from the majority of these studies have been inconclusive. This meta-analysis  was performed to evaluate the effectiveness of magnesium on patient outcomes  after aneurysmal SAH. MATERIALS AND METHODS: PubMed and the Cochrane library were searched for  controlled clinical trials assessing the efficacy of magnesium sulfate infusion  after aneurysmal SAH. Eight studies consisting of 936 patients were included. RESULTS: There was a decreased risk of poor outcome at 3-6 months after SAH in  magnesium treatment groups when compared to placebo [0.78 (95% CI 0.66-0.93)].  Poor outcome was defined as severe disability, persistent vegetative state, or  death, as measured by the Glasgow outcome scale (GOS), extended Glasgow outcome  scale (GOSE) or modified Rankin scale (mRS). The risk of mortality after SAH was  unaffected by magnesium treatment [RR 0.68 (95% CI 0.58-1.27)]. CONCLUSION: Magnesium sulfate infusion decreases risk of poor outcome after  aneurysmal SAH. Current studies in the literature do not suggest a role for  magnesium sulfate in mortality reduction after SAH.', ""BACKGROUND: Cerebral vasospasm and related delayed ischaemic deficits (DIDs)  occur in about 17% to 40% of patients with aneurysmal subarachnoid haemorrhage  (SAH) and lead to a poor outcome. Cholesterol-reducing agents might improve  unfavourable outcomes. OBJECTIVES: To assess the effects of cholesterol-reducing agents for improving  outcomes in patients with aneurysmal SAH. SEARCH METHODS: We searched the Cochrane Stroke Group Trials Register (May  2012), the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL) (The  Cochrane Library 2012, Issue 5), MEDLINE (1948 to May 2012) and EMBASE (1980 to  May 2012). We also searched three Chinese databases: SinoMed, CNKI and VIP (May  2012). In an effort to identify further published, ongoing and unpublished  trials we searched relevant clinical trials and research registers (May 2012),  contacted pharmaceutical companies and investigators known to be involved in  previous trials and screened the reference lists of all relevant articles  identified. SELECTION CRITERIA: We included randomised controlled trials (RCTs) that  compared cholesterol-reducing agents with control or placebo treatment in  participants with aneurysmal SAH. DATA COLLECTION AND ANALYSIS: Two review authors independently applied the  inclusion criteria, reviewed the relevant trials and extracted data. We did not  perform meta-analysis as we only included one RCT in the review. MAIN RESULTS: We included one study in which 39 patients received either  simvastatin (80 mg daily; n = 19) or placebo (n = 20) for 14 days. The incidence  of DIDs (secondary outcome) was 26% (5/19) in the simvastatin group versus 60%  (12/20) in the placebo group (risk ratio (RR) 0.44, 95% confidence interval (CI)  0.19 to 1.01, P = 0.05). This means that, in this study, simvastatin had no  effect on DIDs. Two patients in the simvastatin group and one patient in the  placebo group had elevated levels of aspartate transaminase or alanine  transaminase. One patient in the simvastatin group had a raised creatine  phosphokinase. There were no results from this trial for the primary outcome of  death or dependency at six months. AUTHORS' CONCLUSIONS: We cannot draw any conclusions about the effectiveness and  safety of lowering cholesterol in aneurysmal SAH because of insufficient  reliable evidence from only one small trial. More RCTs are needed."", 'Objective The present study was performed to explore the therapeutic potential  of simvastatin in subarachnoid hemorrhage (SAH) in the context of the  Simvastatin in Aneurysmal Subarachnoid Hemorrhage (STASH) trial. Methods  MEDLINE, EMBASE, and the Cochrane Library were searched for all randomized  controlled trials (RCTs) investigating the therapeutic effect of simvastatin on  aneurysmal SAH. We applied a random-effects model to calculate the data. Results  Five RCTs involving 951 patients met the eligibility criteria. We found no  statistically significant effects on vasospasm detected by transcranial cerebral  Doppler (relative risk [RR], 0.91; 95% confidence interval [CI], 0.55-1.49),  delayed cerebral ischemia (DCI) (RR, 0.85; 95% CI, 0.63-1.14), or all-cause  mortality (RR, 1.02; 95% CI, 0.67-1.54). Subgroup analysis showed that these  consolidated results were stable at different doses, different times to start of  treatment, and different courses of treatment in all included RCTs. Sensitivity  analysis showed that the STASH trial, which had a large population, did not  influence the consolidated results of all three outcomes. Conclusions  Simvastatin showed no benefits in decreasing the incidence of vasospasm, DCI, or  all-cause mortality after aneurysmal SAH. We conclude that patients with SAH  should not be treated routinely with simvastatin during the acute stage.']","No. Based on meta-analysis, there is no evidence that tirilazad, in addition to nimodipine, reduces mortality or improves poor outcome in patients with aneurysmal subarachnoid haemorrhage."
71,Which animal bite can cause Capnocytophaga canimorsus infection?,"['A diagnosis of myocardial infarction is made using a combination of clinical  presentation, electrocardiogram and cardiac biomarkers. However, myocardial  infarction can be caused by factors other than coronary artery plaque rupture  and thrombosis. We describe an interesting case presenting with hypertensive  emergency and type 2 myocardial infarction resulting from Pheochromocytoma  associated with Capnocytophaga canimorsus infection from a dog bite. We also  review current literature on the management of hypertensive emergency and  Pheochromocytoma.', 'Capnocytophaga canimorsus is part of normal gingival flora of dogs and cats. The  organism can cause septicemia, meningitis, and endocarditis in humans after  contact with dogs or cats. In spite of the frequency of gastrointestinal  symptoms in C. canimorsus infection patients, specific gastrointestinal disease  or clinical images have not been reported. We report a case of C. canimorsus  bacteremia presenting with acute cholecystitis in elderly woman. She suffered  from general fatigue and right upper abdominal pain. She had leukocytosis and  abnormal liver function tests. She showed abnormal findings of the gallbladder  by abdominal computed tomography and ultrasonography. She was diagnosed with  acute cholecystitis without gallstones and was administered with antibiotics.  C.\xa0canimorsus was isolated from blood cultures. A history of an insignificant  wound secondary to a dog bite was elicited. She recovered completely with  antibiotic treatment. This case revealed that C.\xa0canimorsus bacteremia can be  presented with acute cholecystitis, suggesting that C.\xa0canimorsus could cause  cholecystitis. And this cholecystitis can be treated with antibiotics without  operation. Physicians seeing patients with acute cholecysitis should ask  questions regarding animal contact.', ""INTRODUCTION: The gram-negative bacteria known as Capnocytophaga canimorsus (C.  canimorsus) is found in dog saliva and rarely can cause severe infection in  humans following a bite or scratch. There has previously been just a single case  described in the literature of Acute Acalculous Cholecystitis (AAC) secondary to  C. canimorsus. PRESENTATION OF CASE: Here we describe the second ever published case of C.  canimorsus bacteremia presenting with acute cholecystitis. The patient presented  with epigastric pain and sepsis three weeks post domestic dog bite. On further  examination, he was Murphy's sign positive. Investigations included blood  cultures, Ultrasound Scan and Computed Tomography of the Abdomen. He was treated  with intravenous fluid resuscitation, and intravenous ceftriaxone and  metronidazole. He required an extended course of antibiotics for complete  symptom resolution. His blood cultures were positive for C. Canimorsus. DISCUSSION: This case highlights the ever-present need for thorough history and  examination, and consideration of prolonged antibiotics for cases of  cholecystitis that could be secondary to C. canimorsus bacteremia. CONCLUSION: We strongly advocate blood cultures in patients who present with  abdominal pain and sepsis, particularly when they have a recent history of  animal bite. In cases of cholecystitis secondary to C. canimorsus it may be  necessary to monitor the patient's progress more closely and treat with  prolonged targeted antibiotic therapy."", 'Capnocytophaga canimorsus is a gram-negative, capnophilic rod constituting  normal bacterial flora of the oral cavity of dogs and cats. It is also  considered to be an etiological factor of infections in human that may lead to  multiple complications, i.a. sepsis, endocarditis and meningitis. C. canimorsus  poses a serious threat, especially to patients with asplenia, cirrhosis or  alcohol abuse. In most cases, infection occurs after a dog bite. Isolation and  identification of the bacteria from the biological material is difficult and  often delayed because of slow growth of the bacteria on microbiological media.  Gold standard for bacteriological identification of C. canimorsus is polymerase  chain reaction method. Amoxicillin with clavulanic acid is considered the drug  of choice used in prophylaxis of C. canimorsus infections. Based on the data  available from the literature, the authors present the epidemiology, risk  factors, clinical picture, diagnostic methods and treatment of the C. canimorsus  infection.', 'Capnocytophaga canimorsus is a gram-negative rod that can be transmitted  primarily by dog bites. This life-threatening organism commonly causes sepsis in  patients with splenectomy or alcoholism. A 53-year-old rheumatoid arthritis male  treated with methotrexate (MTX) for 5 years was admitted for a 4-day history of  fever and dyspnea. He had been bitten on a finger by the family dog 4\xa0days  before onset. Laboratory tests revealed pancytopenia, acute renal failure, and  evidence of disseminated intravascular coagulation, and he subsequently  developed acute respiratory distress syndrome. Furthermore, blood cultures grew  gram-negative bacilli and despite intensive treatment, he died 5\xa0days after  admission. Later, C. canimorsus was identified from his culture samples using a  species-specific polymerase chain reaction. C. canimorsus infections should be  considered in the differential diagnosis of sepsis for immunocompromised hosts  following animal bites.', 'Capnocytophaga canimorsus is a fastidious, slow-growing, gram-negative,  rod-shaped bacterium that belongs to the normal oral flora of dogs and cats.  Human septicemic infections are associated with a high mortality; most cases  occur in immunocompromised patients with a history of dog bite. The fifth case  of cat-associated septicemia caused by Capnocytophaga canimorsus is described.  The six case reports presented here point out the characteristics reported  previously: (a) cats are a source of human infection; (b) alcohol abuse is an  important risk factor for the development of septicemic Capnocytophaga  canimorsus infection; (c) septicemic infection often manifests with disseminated  intravascular consumption coagulopathy or purpura; and (d) some cases of  septicemia in humans result from pets that lick skin ulcers.', 'BACKGROUND: Capnocytophaga canimorsus is a commensal bacterium found in the  saliva of dogs and cats. Clinically significant infections in humans after a  bite are often associated with the presence of immune deficiency. Early  recognition and appropriate treatment are crucial for patient survival. In  addition, patients with immune deficiency are susceptible to serious  life-threatening nosocomial infections, which may also influence the prognosis  of patients with Capnocytophaga canimorsus infection. CASE PRESENTATION: A 62-year-old Caucasian female was admitted with septic  shock, acute respiratory distress syndrome, acute renal failure, metabolic  acidosis and disseminated intravascular coagulation after suffering two small  bites from her dog. She had received a splenectomy during childhood. The patient  survived after early empiric treatment with antibiotics and intensive supportive  care, including ventilation support, a high dose of noradrenalin, and continuous  venovenous hemodialysis applied prior to the definitive diagnosis of  Capnocytophaga canimorsus sepsis. She improved within 2 weeks but, despite all  efforts to prevent nosocomial infection, her hospital course was complicated by  Enterococcus species and Candida albicans pleuropneumonia that prolonged her  stay in the intensive care unit, and necessitated ventilation support for 2  months. CONCLUSION: Severe Capnocytophaga canimorsus sepsis may be complicated by  life-threatening nosocomial infection in immunocompromized patients. The  prophylactic application of antibiotics after a dog bite should be considered in  high-risk individuals with immune deficiency in order to prevent both  Capnocytophyga canimorsus sepsis and serious nosocomial complications.', 'Capnocytophaga species are gram-negative bacilli that inhabit mammalian oral  surfaces and can cause opportunistic infection, especially in asplenic patients.  The species Capnocytophaga canimorsus is particularly associated with dog bites  and is known to cause endocarditis, meningitis, and sepsis in the general  population. In pregnant patients, infections tied to Capnocytophaga species from  human flora have been associated with preterm labor, chorioamnionitis, and  neonatal septicemia. There is little known about the effects of  zoonotically-acquired Capnocytophaga infection in pregnant patients. In this  case report, we present a patient with Capnocytophaga bacteremia acquired after  a dog bite associated with profound thrombocytopenia and preterm labor. Dog  bites are common in the United States, and we present basic recommendations for  management of dog bites in pregnant patients in order to avoid morbidity  associated with delay in time to antibiotic treatment of infection as described  in this case.', ""BACKGROUND: Animal bites are typically harmless, but in rare cases infections  introduced by such bites can be fatal. Capnocytophaga canimorsus, found in the  normal oral flora of dogs, has the potential to cause conditions ranging from  minor cellulitis to fatal sepsis. The tendency of C. canimorsus infections to  present with varied symptoms, the organism's fastidious nature, and difficulty  of culturing make this a challenging diagnosis. Rarely, bacterial cytotoxins  such as those produced by C. canimorsus may act as causative agents of TTP,  further complicating the diagnosis. Early recognition is crucial for survival,  and the variability of presentation must be appreciated. We present the first  known case of C. canimorsus infection resulting in TTP that initially presented  as splenic infarction. CASE PRESENTATION: 72-year-old Caucasian male presented with a four-day history  of abdominal pain, nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, and intermittent confusion. On  presentation, vital signs were stable and the patient was afebrile. Physical  examination was unremarkable apart from petechiae on the inner left thigh, and  extreme diffuse abdominal pain to palpation and percussion along with positive  rebound tenderness. Initial investigations revealed leukocytosis with left shift  and thrombocytopenia, but normal liver enzymes, cardiac enzymes, lipase, INR and  PTT. Abdominal CT demonstrated a non-enhancing spleen and hemoperitoneum,  suggesting complete splenic infarction. Although the patient remained afebrile,  he continued deteriorating over the next two days with worsening  thrombocytopenia. After becoming febrile, he developed microangiopathic  hemolytic anemia and hemodynamic instability, and soon after was intubated due  to hypoxic respiratory failure and decreased consciousness. Plasma exchange was  initiated but subsequently stopped when positive blood cultures grew a  gram-negative organism. The patient progressively improved following therapy  with piperacillin-tazobactam, which was switched to imipenem, then meropenem  when Capnocytophaga was identified. CONCLUSIONS: There is a common misconception amongst practitioners that the  presence of systemic infection excludes the possibility of TTP and vice versa.  This case emphasizes that TTP may occur secondary to a systemic infection,  thereby allowing the two processes to coexist. It is important to maintain a  wide differential when considering the diagnosis of either TTP or C. canimorsus  infection since delays in treatment may have fatal consequences."", 'INTRODUCTION: Capnocytophaga canimorsus infections are associated with dog  bites, especially in asplenic or immunocompromised patients, and typically  manifest as sepsis and/or bacteremia. Meningitis has been rarely described, and  its diagnosis may be delayed due to poor or slow growth using traditional  culture techniques. We provide our experience using polymerase chain reaction  (PCR) to establish the diagnosis and perform a comprehensive review of C.  canimorsus meningitis cases to provide summary data on the clinical  manifestations, diagnosis, and outcomes of this unusual infection. METHODS: A systematic review of the peer-reviewed English literature (PubMed,  Embase, Ovid Medline) from January 1966 to March 2018 was conducted to identify  cases of C. canimorsus meningitis. Data collected included demographics, risk  factors, cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) findings, PCR results, treatments, and  outcomes. Descriptive statistics are presented as numbers (percentages) and  medians (ranges). RESULTS: A total of 37 patients were reviewed with a median age of 63\xa0years  (12\xa0days to 83\xa0years) with a male predominance (76%). A relatively low  proportion had an immunocompromised state (16% splenectomy and 5% steroid use);  the most common risk factor was alcoholism (19%). Fifty-nine percent reported a  dog bite (all within\u2009≤\u200914\xa0days prior to presentation), while 22%\xa0reported a  non-bite dog exposure, 3% reported cat bite, and 3% reported both dog and cat  exposures; 11% reported no animal contact. CSF parameters included a median  white count of 1024 cells/mm3, 81% had neutrophilic predominance, median protein  of 190\xa0mg/dl, and median glucose CSF/serum ratio 0.23. In 54% of cases, blood  cultures were positive for C. canimorsus (median, 4\xa0days) and 70% had positive  CSF cultures (median, 5\xa0days). PCR established the diagnosis in eight (22%)  cases. Antibiotic therapy was given for a median of 15\xa0days (range, 7 to  42\xa0days). Prognosis was overall favorable with only one (3%) death reported and  adverse neurologic and/or physical sequelae in 19% of the survivors. CONCLUSION: C. canimorsus meningitis is a rare but increasingly important  clinical entity occurring in patients of all ages, typically after dog exposure.  While classically considered an infection among immunocompromised patients, most  cases have occurred in previously healthy, immunocompetent persons. Diagnosis  may be rapidly established by PCR, and this test should be considered in  culture-negative cases with associated exposures. Outcome was generally  favorable after a median antibiotic duration of 15\xa0days.']","Capnocytophaga canimorsus infection is typically associated with dog bites, especially in asplenic or immunocompromised patients, and typically manifest as sepsis and/or bacteremia."
72,Does RNA polymerase II have RNA cleavage activity?,"['Regulation of transcription elongation is an important mechanism in controlling  eukaryotic gene expression. SII is an RNA polymerase II-binding protein that  stimulates transcription elongation and also activates nascent transcript  cleavage by RNA polymerase II in elongation complexes in vitro (Reines, D.  (1992) J. Biol. Chem. 267, 3795-3800). Here we show that SII-dependent in vitro  transcription through an arrest site in a human gene is preceded by nascent  transcript cleavage. RNA cleavage appeared to be an obligatory step in the SII  activation process. Recombinant SII activated cleavage while a truncated  derivative lacking polymerase binding activity did not. Cleavage was not  restricted to an elongation complex arrested at this particular site, showing  that nascent RNA hydrolysis is a general property of RNA polymerase II  elongation complexes. These data support a model whereby SII stimulates  elongation via a ribonuclease activity of the elongation complex.', ""During gene transcription, the RNA polymerase (Pol) active center can catalyze  RNA cleavage. This intrinsic cleavage activity is strong for Pol I and Pol III  but very weak for Pol II. The reason for this difference is unclear because the  active centers of the polymerases are virtually identical. Here we show that Pol  II gains strong cleavage activity when the C-terminal zinc ribbon domain  (C-ribbon) of subunit Rpb9 is replaced by its counterpart from the Pol III  subunit C11. X-ray analysis shows that the C-ribbon has detached from its site  on the Pol II surface and is mobile. Mutagenesis indicates that the C-ribbon  transiently inserts into the Pol II pore to complement the active center. This  mechanism is also used by transcription factor IIS, a factor that can bind Pol  II and induce strong RNA cleavage. Together with published data, our results  indicate that Pol I and Pol III contain catalytic C-ribbons that complement the  active center, whereas Pol II contains a non-catalytic C-ribbon that is  immobilized on the enzyme surface. Evolution of the Pol II system may have  rendered mRNA transcript cleavage controllable by the dissociable factor  transcription factor IIS to enable promoter-proximal gene regulation and  elaborate 3'-processing and transcription termination."", 'Budding yeast RNA polymerase III (Pol III) contains a small, essential subunit,  named C11, that is conserved in humans and shows a strong homology to TFIIS. A  mutant Pol III, heterocomplemented with Schizosaccharomyces pombe C11, was  affected in transcription termination in vivo. A purified form of the enzyme  (Pol III Delta), deprived of C11 subunit, initiated properly but ignored pause  sites and was defective in termination. Remarkably, Pol III Delta lacked the  intrinsic RNA cleavage activity of complete Pol III. In vitro reconstitution  experiments demonstrated that Pol III RNA cleavage activity is mediated by C11.  Mutagenesis in C11 of two conserved residues, which are critical for the  TFIIS-dependent cleavage activity of Pol II, is lethal. Immunoelectron  microscopy data suggested that C11 is localized on the mobile thumb-like stalk  of the polymerase. We propose that C11 allows the enzyme to switch between an  RNA elongation and RNA cleavage mode and that the essential role of the Pol III  RNA cleavage activity is to remove the kinetic barriers to the termination  process. The integration of TFIIS function into a specific Pol III subunit may  stem from the opposite requirements of Pol III and Pol II in terms of transcript  length and termination efficiency.', 'RNA chain elongation by RNA polymerase is a dynamic process. Techniques that  allow the isolation of active elongation complexes have enabled investigators to  describe individual steps in the polymerization of RNA chains. This article will  describe recent studies of elongation by RNA polymerase II (pol II). At least  four types of blockage to chain elongation can be overcome by elongation factor  SII: (a) naturally occurring ""arrest"" sequences, (b) DNA-bound protein, (c)  drugs bound in the DNA minor groove, and (d) chain-terminating substrates  incorporated into the RNA chain. SII binds to RNA polymerase II and stimulates a  ribonuclease activity that shortens nascent transcripts from their 3\' ends. This  RNA cleavage is required for chain elongation from some template positions. As a  result, the pol II elongation complex can repeatedly shorten and reextend the  nascent RNA chain in a process we refer to as cleavage-resynthesis. Hence,  assembly of large RNAs does not necessarily proceed in a direct manner. The  ability to shorten and reextend nascent RNAs means that a transcription  impediment through which only half the enzyme molecules can proceed per  encounter, can be overcome by 99% of the molecules after six iterations of  cleavage-resynthesis. Surprisingly, the boundaries of the elongation complex do  not move upstream after RNA cleavage. The physico-chemical alterations in the  elongation complex that accompany RNA cleavage and permit renewed chain  elongation are not yet understood.', ""In the absence of DNA, purified yeast RNA polymerase II can bind RNA to form a  binary complex. RNA in such RNA-RNA polymerase complexes undergoes reactions  previously thought to be unique to nascent RNA in ternary complexes with DNA,  including TFIIS-dependent cleavage and elongation by 3'-terminal addition of NMP  from NTP. Both of these reactions are inhibited by alpha-amanitin. Hence, by  several criteria the RNA in binary complexes is bound to the polymerase in a  manner quite similar to that in ternary complexes in which the catalytic site  for nucleotide addition is positioned at or near the 3'-OH terminus of the RNA.  These findings are consistent with a model for the RNA polymerase ternary  complex in which the RNA is bound at the 3' terminus through two protein-binding  sites located up to 10 nt apart."", 'Influenza virus intimately associates with host RNA polymerase II (Pol II) and  mRNA processing machinery. Here, we use mammalian native elongating transcript  sequencing (mNET-seq) to examine Pol II behavior during viral infection. We show  that influenza virus executes a two-pronged attack on host transcription. First,  viral infection causes decreased Pol II gene occupancy downstream of  transcription start sites. Second, virus-induced cellular stress leads to a  catastrophic failure of Pol II termination at poly(A) sites, with transcription  often continuing for tens of kilobases. Defective Pol II termination occurs  independently of the ability of the viral NS1 protein to interfere with host  mRNA processing. Instead, this termination defect is a common effect of diverse  cellular stresses and underlies the production of previously reported  downstream-of-gene transcripts (DoGs). Our work has implications for  understanding not only host-virus interactions but also fundamental aspects of  mammalian transcription.', ""RNA polymerase II is implicated in the RNA-templated RNA synthesis during  replication of viroids and Hepatitis Delta Virus (HDV); however, neither the RNA  template nor protein factor requirements for this process are well defined. We  have developed an in vitro transcription system based on HeLa cell nuclear  extract (NE), in which a segment of antigenomic RNA corresponding to the  left-hand tip region of the HDV rod-like structure serves as a template for  efficient and highly specific RNA synthesis. Accumulation of the unique RNA  product is highly sensitive to alpha-amanitin in HeLa NE and only partially  sensitive to this drug in NE from PMG cells that contain an allele of the  alpha-amanitin-resistant subunit of pol II, strongly suggesting pol II  involvement in this reaction. Detailed analysis of the RNA product revealed that  it represents a chimeric molecule composed of a newly synthesized transcript  covalently attached to the 5' half of the RNA template. Selection of the start  site for transcription is remarkably specific and depends on the secondary  structure of the RNA template, rather than on its primary sequence. Some  features of this reaction resemble the RNA cleavage-extension process observed  for pol II-arrested complexes in vitro. A possible involvement of the described  reaction in HDV replication is discussed."", 'TFIIS is a transcription elongation factor that stimulates transcript cleavage  activity of arrested RNA polymerase II (Pol II). Recent studies revealed that  TFIIS has also a role in Pol II transcription initiation. To improve our  understanding of TFIIS function in vivo, we performed genome-wide location  analysis of this factor. Under normal growth conditions, TFIIS was detected on  Pol II-transcribed genes, and TFIIS occupancy was well correlated with that of  Pol II, indicating that TFIIS recruitment is not restricted to NTP-depleted  cells. Unexpectedly, TFIIS was also detected on almost all Pol III-transcribed  genes. TFIIS and Pol III occupancies correlated well genome-wide on this novel  class of targets. In vivo, some dst1 mutants were partly defective in tRNA  synthesis and showed a reduced Pol III occupancy at the restrictive temperature.  In vitro transcription assays suggested that TFIIS may affect Pol III start site  selection. These data provide strong in vivo and in vitro evidence in favor of a  role of TFIIS as a general Pol III transcription factor.', 'We have reported previously the isolation and genetic characterization of  mutations in the gene encoding the largest subunit of yeast RNA polymerase II  (RNAPII), which lead to 6-azauracil (6AU)-sensitive growth. It was suggested  that these mutations affect the functional interaction between RNAPII and  transcription-elongation factor TFIIS because the 6AU-sensitive phenotype of the  mutant strains was similar to that of a strain defective in the production of  TFIIS and can be suppressed by increasing the dosage of the yeast TFIIS-encoding  gene, PPR2, RNAPIIs were purified and characterized from two independent  6AU-sensitive yeast mutants and from wild-type (wt) cells. In vitro, in the  absence of TFIIS, the purified wt polymerase and the two mutant polymerases  showed similar specific activity in polymerization, readthrough at intrinsic  transcriptional arrest sites and nascent RNA cleavage. In contrast to the wt  polymerase, both mutant polymerases were not stimulated by the addition of a  3-fold molar excess of TFIIS in assays of promoter-independent transcription,  readthrough or cleavage. However, stimulation of the ability of the mutant  RNAPIIs to cleave nascent RNA and to read through intrinsic arrest sites was  observed at TFIIS:RNAPII molar ratios greater than 600:1. Consistent with these  findings, the binding affinity of the mutant polymerases for TFIIS was found to  be reduced by more than 50-fold compared with that of the wt enzyme. These  studies demonstrate that TFIIS has an important role in the regulation of  transcription by yeast RNAPII and identify a possible binding site for TFIIS on  RNAPII.', ""Eukaryotic RNA polymerase II transcribes precursors of mRNAs and of  non-protein-coding RNAs such as snRNAs and snoRNAs. These RNAs have to be  processed at their 3' ends to be functional. mRNAs are matured by cleavage and  polyadenylation that require a well-characterized protein complex. Small RNAs  are also subject to 3' end cleavage but are not polyadenylated. Here we show  that two newly identified proteins, Pti1p and Ref2p, although they were found  associated with the pre-mRNA 3' end processing complex, are essential for yeast  snoRNA 3' end maturation. We also provide evidence that Pti1p probably acts by  uncoupling cleavage and polyadenylation, and functions in coordination with the  Nrd1p-dependent pathway for 3' end formation of non-polyadenylated transcripts.""]","In addition to RNA synthesis, multisubunit RNA polymerases (msRNAPs) support enzymatic reactions such as intrinsic transcript cleavage. The eukaryotic transcription factor TFIIS enhances elongation and nascent transcript cleavage activities of RNA polymerase II in a stalled elongation complex."
73,What is Trypan blue used for?,"['BACKGROUND: In this study, responses to fatty acid treatments in commonly used  prostate cancer cell culture models and variability of gene expression between  them were determined. MATERIALS AND METHODS: PC3, DU145, LNCaP, VCaP and PNT2 cells were treated with  100 μM of either oleate, stearate or conjugated linoleate. Cell proliferation  and viability were assessed using trypan blue and 3-(4,  5-dimethylthiazol-2-yl)-2, 5-diphenyltetrazolium bromide (MTT) assay  respectively. Gene expression was measured using real-time polymerase chain  reaction (PCR). RESULTS: Conjugated linoleic acid reduced cell proliferation and viability in  all prostate cancer cell lines, whilst the effects of oleic and stearic acid on  proliferation were found to be cell line-dependent. A reduction in gene  expression of fatty acid desaturases was observed in prostate cancer cell lines  compared to normal prostate cells. CONCLUSION: Differential responses of the cell lines investigated here to fatty  acid treatment suggest that multiple prostate cancer cell line models should be  used when designing experiments aimed at examining lipid metabolism in prostate  cancer.', 'Surface coatings of nanoparticles (NPs) are known to influence advantageous  features of NPs as well as potential toxicity. Iron oxide (Fe3O4) NPs are  applied for both medical diagnostics and targeted drug delivery. We investigated  the potential cytotoxicity and genotoxicity of uncoated iron oxide (U-Fe3O4) NPs  in comparison with oleate-coated iron oxide (OC-Fe3O4) NPs. Testing was  performed in vitro in human lymphoblastoid TK6 cells and in primary human blood  cells. For cytotoxicity testing, relative growth activity, trypan blue  exclusion, (3)H-thymidine incorporation and cytokinesis-block proliferation  index were assessed. Genotoxicity was evaluated by the alkaline comet assay for  detection of strand breaks and oxidized purines. Particle characterization was  performed in the culture medium. Cellular uptake, morphology and pathology were  evaluated by electron microscopy. U-Fe3O4 NPs were found not to be cytotoxic  (considering interference of NPs with proliferation test) or genotoxic under our  experimental conditions. In contrast, OC-Fe3O4 NPs were cytotoxic in a  dose-dependent manner, and also induced DNA damage, indicating genotoxic  potential. Intrinsic properties of sodium oleate were excluded as a cause of the  toxic effect. Electron microscopy data were consistent with the cytotoxicity  results. Coating clearly changed the behaviour and cellular uptake of the NPs,  inducing pathological morphological changes in the cells.', 'AIM: To immobilize dental pulp stem cells (DPSC) in alginate microspheres and to  determine cell viability, proliferation, stem cell characteristics and  osteogenic potential of the immobilized DPSCs. METHODOLOGY: Human DPSCs isolated from the dental pulp were immobilized in 1%  w/v alginate microspheres. Viability and proliferation of immobilized DPSCs were  determined by trypan blue and MTT assay, respectively. Stem cell characteristics  of DPSCs post immobilization were verified by labelling the cells with CD73 and  CD90. Osteogenic potential of immobilized DPSCs was assessed by the presence of  osteocalcin. Alizarin red staining and O-cresolphthalein complexone method  confirmed and quantified calcium deposition. A final reverse transcriptase PCR  evaluated the expression of osteogenic markers - ALP, Runx-2 and OCN. RESULTS: More than 80% of immobilized DPSCs were viable throughout the 3-week  study. Proliferation appeared controlled and consistent unlike DPSCs in the  control group. Presence of CD73 and CD90 markers confirmed the stem cell nature  of immobilized DPSCs. The presence of osteocalcin, an osteoblastic marker, was  confirmed in the microspheres on day 21. Mineralization assays showed high  calcium deposition indicating elevated osteogenic potential of immobilized  DPSCs. Osteogenic genes- ALP, Runx-2 and OCN were also upregulated in  immobilized DPSCs. Surprisingly, immobilized DPSCs in the control group cultured  in conventional stem cell media showed upregulation of osteogenic genes and  expressed osteocalcin. CONCLUSION: Dental pulp stem cells immobilized in alginate hydrogels exhibit  enhanced osteogenic potential while maintaining high cell viability both of  which are fundamental for bone tissue regeneration.', ""Ex vivo skin preservation is important for skin banks, burn centers, and in  research; however, the optimal preservation solution is not known. Human  amniotic fluid (HAF), in addition to its role in fetal wound healing, has  promise as an effective and readily available preservation solution. The purpose  of this study was to compare the efficacy of several solutions, including HAF,  in full-thickness skin preservation. Human amniotic fluid was obtained from  patients undergoing amniocentesis. Full-thickness skin obtained during  abdominoplasty was divided into 1-cm(2) samples. These specimens were preserved  in either saline, HAF from a single patient, pooled HAF, University of Wisconsin  solution, or custodial histidine-tryptophan-ketoglutarate solution at 4°C. There  were 5 samples in each group. Specimens were examined for keratinocyte survival  at 7, 14, 21, 28, and 35 days using the trypan blue assay. The first 200 cells  identified were counted to calculate the degree of cell death. Comparisons were  made between the groups, and a multivariable repeated-measures analysis was  performed to determine statistical significance, which was defined as P < 0.05.  The individual and pooled HAF showed greater keratinocyte survival than the  other solutions, at each time point. The difference was statistically  significant (P < 0.05) when compared to saline and custodial solution but not  statistically significant when compared to University of Wisconsin solution.  When used as a tissue preservation solution, HAF produces superior keratinocyte  survival than several commercially available solutions.

METHODS: Enzyme digestion method was used to obtain PMSCs, and PMSCs were  amplified after culture in vitro. Flow cytometry assay, osteogenic and  adipogenic differentiation were done for MSCs identification. The induction  medium composed of DMEM/F12 + 50 microg/ml VC + 100 ng/ml connective tissue  growth factor (CTGF) was added into the 24-well plate for 16 days induction  period. Pictures were taken to record morphologic change. Immunofluorescence  tests were performed to detect Vimentin, FSP-1, collagen I , collagen III,  desmin and laminin expression before and after induction. At the same time  osteogenic and adipogenic differentiation were used to assay the differentiation  ability change after induction. The induced dermal fibroblasts were frozen in  liquid nitrogen and recovery and trypan blue was used to detect cell viability. RESULTS: After CTGF induction, PMSCs got obvious fibroblasts morphology, the  protein level of Vimentin, FSP-1, collagen I, collagen III and Laminin  increased, PMSCs started to express Desmin, the dermal fibroblasts specific  proteins, and osteogenic and adipogenic differentiation ability was diminished.  PMSCs were successfully induced into dermal fibroblasts, and these induced cells  could get a high cell viability ( more than 90% ) after recovery. CONCLUSIONS: PMSCs could be induced into dermal fibroblasts by CTGF in vitro.  PMSCs have the potential application in skin wound healing, and can be used as  seed cells of dermal fibroblasts.', 'C-Phycocyanin (C-Pc) is one of the major biliprotein pigments of unicellular  cyanbacterium of Spirulina platenesis, it has nutritional, medicinal, and  hepatoprotectant application.

Effective cessation treatments that are both  accessible and attractive to Māori are urgently needed. Cytisine (a plant  extract found in Golden Rain [Cytisus laburnum L.] and the New Zealand Kowhai  [Sophora tetraptera L.] has a similar molecular makeup to nicotine, has been  used successfully as a cessation product in central and eastern Europe and  central Asia for many years, and is low priced. Recent reviews have found that  cytisine is twice as effective as a placebo for smoking cessation. This study  aimed to explore cytisine's potential as a 'rongoā Māori' (traditional Māori  remedy) and its attractiveness to Māori smokers compared with other cessation  products. METHODS: Māori that smoked were interviewed in two focus groups and eight  individual semi-structured interviews. Two key informants were interviewed also. RESULTS: Barriers to using cessation products were financial and effort cost,  pervasive smoking among family and peers, environments permissive of smoking,  and perceived cultural inappropriateness of treatments. Participants were very  interested in cytisine, supported the idea that it would be acceptable to  package it as a rongoā Māori, and all wanted to use it. Named appropriately,  packaged and promoted as a Māori cessation product, participants thought  cytisine would contribute to the restoration of Māori identity and traditional  beliefs and practices in addition to reducing smoking. CONCLUSIONS: Presented as a rongoā Māori, cytisine would likely be more  attractive to Māori than currently available cessation products. Confirmation of  efficacy and safety will be needed before promotion of the product could occur."", 'BACKGROUND: Delamanid (OPC-67683), a nitro-dihydro-imidazooxazole derivative, is  a new antituberculosis medication that inhibits mycolic acid synthesis and has  shown potent in vitro and in vivo activity against drug-resistant strains of  Mycobacterium tuberculosis. METHODS: In this randomized, placebo-controlled, multinational clinical trial,  we assigned 481 patients (nearly all of whom were negative for the human  immunodeficiency virus) with pulmonary multidrug-resistant tuberculosis to  receive delamanid, at a dose of 100 mg twice daily (161 patients) or 200 mg  twice daily (160 patients), or placebo (160 patients) for 2 months in  combination with a background drug regimen developed according to World Health  Organization guidelines. Sputum cultures were assessed weekly with the use of  both liquid broth and solid medium; sputum-culture conversion was defined as a  series of five or more consecutive cultures that were negative for growth of M.  tuberculosis. The primary efficacy end point was the proportion of patients with  sputum-culture conversion in liquid broth medium at 2 months. RESULTS: Among patients who received a background drug regimen plus 100 mg of  delamanid twice daily, 45.4% had sputum-culture conversion in liquid broth at 2  months, as compared with 29.6% of patients who received a background drug  regimen plus placebo (P=0.008). Likewise, as compared with the placebo group,  the group that received the background drug regimen plus 200 mg of delamanid  twice daily had a higher proportion of patients with sputum-culture conversion  (41.9%, P=0.04). The findings were similar with assessment of sputum-culture  conversion in solid medium. Most adverse events were mild to moderate in  severity and were evenly distributed across groups. Although no clinical events  due to QT prolongation on electrocardiography were observed, QT prolongation was  reported significantly more frequently in the groups that received delamanid. CONCLUSIONS: Delamanid was associated with an increase in sputum-culture  conversion at 2 months among patients with multidrug-resistant tuberculosis.  This finding suggests that delamanid could enhance treatment options for  multidrug-resistant tuberculosis.

74,Is there any genetic determinant of hair pigmentation that could be useful in forensic analyses?,"[""In forensic analysis predictive tests for external visible characteristics (or  EVCs), including inference of iris color, represent a potentially useful tool to  guide criminal investigations. Two recent studies, both focused on forensic  testing, have analyzed single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) genotypes underlying  common eye color variation (Mengel-From et al., Forensic Sci. Int. Genet. 4:323  and Walsh et al., Forensic Sci. Int. Genet. 5:170). Each study arrived at  different recommendations for eye color predictive tests aiming to type the most  closely associated SNPs, although both confirmed rs12913832 in HERC2 as the key  predictor, widely recognized as the most strongly associated marker with blue  and brown iris colors. Differences between these two studies in identification  of other eye color predictors may partly arise from varying approaches to  assigning phenotypes, notably those not unequivocally blue or dark brown and  therefore occupying an intermediate iris color continuum. We have developed two  single base extension assays typing 37 SNPs in pigmentation-associated genes to  study SNP-genotype based prediction of eye, skin, and hair color variation.  These assays were used to test the performance of different sets of eye color  predictors in 416 subjects from six populations of north and south Europe. The  presence of a complex and continuous range of intermediate phenotypes distinct  from blue and brown eye colors was confirmed by establishing eye color  populations compared to genetic clusters defined using Structure software. Our  study explored the effect of an expanded SNP combination beyond six markers has  on the ability to predict eye color in a forensic test without extending the SNP  assay excessively - thus maintaining a balance between the test's predictive  value and an ability to reliably type challenging DNA with a multiplex of  manageable size. Our evaluation used AUC analysis (area under the receiver  operating characteristic curves) and naïve Bayesian likelihood-based  classification approaches. To provide flexibility in SNP-based eye color  predictive tests in forensic applications we modified an online Bayesian  classifier, originally developed for genetic ancestry analysis, to provide a  straightforward system to assign eye color likelihoods from a SNP profile  combining additional informative markers from the predictors analyzed by our  study plus those of Walsh and Mengel-From. Two advantages of the online  classifier is the ability to submit incomplete SNP profiles, a common occurrence  when typing challenging DNA, and the ability to handle physically linked SNPs  showing independent effect, by allowing the user to input frequencies from SNP  pairs or larger combinations. This system was used to include the submission of  frequency data for the SNP pair rs12913832 and rs1129038: indicated by our study  to be the two SNPs most closely associated to eye color."", 'We describe a minisequencing protocol for screening DNA samples for the presence  of 12 mutations in the human melanocortin 1 receptor gene (MC1R), eight of which  are associated with the red hair phenotype.

Recent studies have proved that there is a  significant association between some genetic variants of the melanocortin 1  receptor (MC1R) gene and red hair color. The present study focuses on the  potential forensic applicability of variation within this pigment-related gene.  Sequencing of the complete MC1R gene was performed on a group of red-haired  individuals and controls with different pigmentation. A major role in  determination of red hair color is played by two MC1R variants--C451T and C478T.  The optimized minisequencing assay for genotyping of the above positions and  three other important red hair-related MC1R polymorphisms, C252A, G425A, and  G880C was successfully applied to analyze typical forensic specimens.  Determination of a homozygous or heterozygous combination can be a good  predictor of both red hair color and fair skin of a subject.', ""Genetic information in forensic studies is largely limited to CODIS data and the  ability to match samples and assign them to an individual. However, there are  circumstances, in which a given DNA sample does not match anyone in the CODIS  database, and no other information about the donor is available. In this study,  we determined 75 SNPs in 24 genes (previously implicated in human or animal  pigmentation studies) for the analysis of single- and multi-locus associations  with hair, skin, and eye color in 789 individuals of various ethnic backgrounds.  Using multiple linear regression modeling, five SNPs in five genes were found to  account for large proportions of pigmentation variation in hair, skin, and eyes  in our across-population analyses. Thus, these models may be of predictive value  to determine an individual's pigmentation type from a forensic sample,  independent of ethnic origin."", 'The prediction of an individuals physical appearance from small biological  samples, such as those collected from crime scenes may still sound like science  fiction, but how close are we to achieving this goal?

Results of these studies are  consistent with a linear recessive allelic model with multiplicative penetrance  in the inheritance of red hair. Four alleles, D84E, R151C, R160W, and D294H, are  strongly associated with red hair and fair skin with multinomial regression  analysis showing odds ratios of 63, 118, 50, and 94, respectively. An additional  three low-penetrance alleles V60L, V92M, and R163Q have odds ratios 6, 5, and 2  relative to the wild-type allele. To address the cellular effects of MC1R  variant alleles in signal transduction, we expressed these receptors in  permanently transfected HEK293 cells. Measurement of receptor activity via  induction of a cAMP-responsive luciferase reporter gene found that the R151C and  R160W receptors were active in the presence of NDP-MSH ligand, but at much  reduced levels compared with that seen with the wild-type receptor. The ability  to stimulate phosphorylation of the cAMP response element binding protein (CREB)  transcription factor was also apparent in all stimulated MC1R variant  allele-expressing HEK293 cell extracts as assessed by immunoblotting. In  contrast, human melanoma cell lines showed wide variation in the their ability  to undergo cAMP-mediated CREB phosphorylation. Culture of human melanocytes of  known MC1R genotype may provide the best experimental approach to examine the  functional consequences for each MC1R variant allele. With this objective, we  have established more than 300 melanocyte cell strains of defined MC1R genotype.', 'Cutaneous pigmentation is a major determinant of the cutaneous response to  ultraviolet radiation, and consequently of the risk of developing skin cancer.  Over the past 10 years, several genes involved in melanogenesis have been  identified, including the melanocortin 1 receptor gene. Recent work on the  melanocortin 1 receptor suggests that it is a key player in determining whether  eumelanin or pheomelanin is predominantly produced both in vitro and in vivo. In  the mouse, variants of this receptor, which differ in their ability to activate  adenylyl cyclase, are associated with different coat colors. In humans,  melanocortin 1 receptor variants are associated with red hair and fair skin, and  work in progress from our laboratory suggests that certain melanocortin 1  receptor variants may preferentially be associated with hair color rather than  skin type. In addition, melanocortin 1 receptor variants are a risk factor,  possibly independent of skin type, for melanoma susceptibility.', 'We describe a minisequencing protocol for screening DNA samples for the presence  of 12 mutations in the human melanocortin 1 receptor gene (MC1R), eight of which  are associated with the red hair phenotype.

A demonstrated lack of linkage to SILV,  the strong candidate gene for silver, led to the initiation of a genome scan  utilizing 2 pedigrees segregating for silver coat color. Linkage mapping defined  a genomic region for SILVER as a 3.3-Mb region, (95.87-99.21 Mb) on chromosome  D2, (peak logarithm of the odds = 10.5, = 0), which displays conserved synteny  to a genomic interval between 118.58 and 121.85 Mb on chromosome 10 in the human  genome. In the domestic cat, mutations at the SILVER locus suppress the  development of pigment in the hair, but in contrast to other mammalian silver  variants, there is an apparently greater influence on the production of  pheomelanin than eumelanin pigment. The mapping of a novel locus for SILVER  offers much promise in identifying a gene that may help elucidate aspects of  pheomelanogenesis, a pathway that has been very elusive, and illustrates the  promise of the cat genome project in increasing our understanding of basic  biological processes of general relevance for mammals.']","Yes, there are at least 12 genes associated with human hair color variation such as: TYR, TYRP1, OCA2, SLC45A2, SLC24A5, MC1R, ASIP and KITLG."
75,What is the lay name of the treatment for CCSVI (chronic cerebro-spinal venous insufficiency)  in multiple sclerosis.,"['Chronic cerebrospinal venous insufficiency (CCSVI) is a putative new theory that  has been suggested by some to have a direct causative relation with the  symptomatology associated with multiple sclerosis (MS) [1]. The core foundation  of this theory is that there is abnormal venous drainage from the brain due to  outflow obstruction in the draining jugular vein and/or azygos veins. This  abnormal venous drainage, which is characterised by special ultrasound criteria,  called the ""venous hemodynamic insufficiency severity score"" (VHISS), is said to  cause intracerebral flow disturbance or outflow problems that lead to  periventricular deposits [2]. In the CCSVI theory, these deposits have a great  similarity to the iron deposits seen around the veins in the legs in patients  with chronic deep vein thrombosis. Zamboni, who first described this new theory,  has promoted balloon dilatation to treat the outflow problems, thereby curing  CCSVI and by the same token alleviating MS complaints. However, this theory does  not fit into the existing bulk of scientific data concerning the pathophysiology  of MS. In contrast, there is increasing worldwide acceptance of CCSVI and the  associated balloon dilatation treatment, even though there is no supporting  scientific evidence. Furthermore, most of the information we have comes from one  source only. The treatment is called ""liberation treatment,"" and the results of  the treatment can be watched on YouTube. There are well-documented testimonies  by MS patients who have gained improvement in their personal quality of life  (QOL) after treatment. However, there are no data available from patients who  underwent unsuccessful treatments with which to obtain a more balanced view. The  current forum for the reporting of success in treating CCSVI and thus MS seems  to be the Internet. At the CIRCE office and the MS Centre in Amsterdam, we  receive approximately 10 to 20 inquiries a month about this treatment. In  addition, many interventional radiologists, who are directly approached by MS  patients, contact the Cardiovascular and Interventional Radiological Society of  Europe (CIRSE) for advice. Worldwide, several centres are actively promoting and  performing balloon dilatation, with or without stenting, for CCSVI. Thus far, no  trial data are available, and there is currently no randomized controlled trial  (RCT) in progress Therefore, the basis for this new treatment rests on anecdotal  evidence and successful testimonies by patients on the Internet. CIRSE believes  that this is not a sound basis on which to offer a new treatment, which could  have possible procedure-related complications, to an often desperate patient  population.', ""BACKGROUND: Multiple sclerosis (MS) is a chronic inflammatory demyelinating  disease of the central nervous system with a disabling progressive course.  Chronic cerebrospinal venous insufficiency (CCSVI) has recently been described  as a vascular condition characterized by restricted venous outflow from the  brain, mainly due to blockages of the internal jugular and azygos veins. Despite  a wide variability among studies, it has been found to be associated with MS.  Data from a few small case series suggest possible improvement of the clinical  course and quality of life by performing percutaneous balloon angioplasty (PTA)  of the stenotic veins. STUDY DESIGN AND METHODS: This is a multicenter, randomized, parallel group,  blinded, sham-controlled trial to assess the efficacy and safety of PTA.  Participants with relapsing remitting MS or secondary progressive MS and a  sonographic diagnosis of CCSVI will be enrolled after providing their informed  consent. Each participant will be centrally randomized to receive catheter  venography and PTA or catheter venography and sham PTA. Two primary end points  with respect to efficacy at 12 months are (1) a combined end point obtained  through the integration of five functional indicators, walking, balance, manual  dexterity, bladder control, and visual acuity, objectively measured by  instruments; and (2) number of new brain lesions measured by T2-weighted MRI  sequences. Secondary end points include annual relapse rate, change in Expanded  Disability Status Scale score, proportion of patients with zero, one or two, or  more than two relapses; fatigue; anxiety and depression; general cognitive  state; memory/attention/calculus; impact of bladder incontinence; and adverse  events. Six hundred seventy-nine patients will be recruited. The follow-up is  scheduled at 12 months. Patients, treating neurologists, trained outcome  assessors, and the statistician in charge of data analysis will be masked to the  assigned treatment. DISCUSSION: The study will provide an answer regarding the efficacy of PTA on  patients' functional disability in balance, motor, sensory, visual and bladder  function, cognitive status, and emotional status, which are meaningful clinical  outcomes, beyond investigating the effects on inflammation. In fact, an  important part of patients' expectations, sustained and amplified by anecdotal  data, has to do precisely with these functional aspects. TRIAL REGISTRATION: Clinicaltrials.gov NCT01371760."", 'BACKGROUND: In 2009, Dr. Paolo Zamboni proposed chronic cerebrospinal venous  insufficiency (CCSVI) as a possible cause of multiple sclerosis (MS). Although  his theory and the associated treatment (""liberation therapy"") received little  more than passing interest in the international scientific and medical  communities, his ideas became the source of tremendous public and political  tension in Canada. The story moved rapidly from mainstream media to social  networking sites. CCSVI and liberation therapy swiftly garnered support among  patients and triggered remarkable and relentless advocacy efforts. Policy makers  have responded in a variety of ways to the public\'s call for action. DISCUSSION: We present three different perspectives on this evolving story, that  of a health journalist who played a key role in the media coverage of this  issue, that of a health law and policy scholar who has closely observed the  unfolding public policy developments across the country, and that of a medical  ethicist who sits on an expert panel convened by the MS Society of Canada and  the Canadian Institutes of Health Research to assess the evidence as it emerges. SUMMARY: This story raises important questions about resource allocation and  priority setting in scientific research and science policy. The growing power of  social media represents a new level of citizen engagement and advocacy, and  emphasizes the importance of open debate about the basis on which such policy  choices are made. It also highlights the different ways evidence may be  understood, valued and utilized by various stakeholders and further emphasizes  calls to improve science communication so as to support balanced and informed  decision-making.', 'Chronic cerebrospinal venous insufficiency (CCSVI) is a hypothesis through which  cerebral venous drainage abnormalities contribute towards the pathogenesis of  multiple sclerosis. CCSVI venoplasty is already practised worldwide. We report  the case of a 33-year-old lady with multiple sclerosis who underwent left  internal jugular venoplasty resulting in iatrogenic jugular thrombosis requiring  open thrombectomy for symptom relief. This occurred without insertion of a stent  and while fully anticoagulated. Clinicians should be aware that endovenous  treatment of CCSVI could cause paradoxical deterioration of cerebral venous  drainage. Patients with complications post venoplasty are now presenting to  geographically distant vascular units.', 'Multiple sclerosis (MS) is an inflammatory demyelinating disease of the central  nervous system (CNS) by an unknown pathogenesis. MR venography and postmortem  studies have demonstrated a topographic correspondence between multiple  sclerosis (MS) plaques and the cerebral venous system pathology. In recent  observational studies performed on patients from distinctive gene pools, the  prevalence of chronic cerebrospinal venous insufficiency (CCSVI) in MS ranged  from 56% to 100%. Endovascular treatment (percutaneous transluminal angioplasty  (PTA) with or without stenting) of CCSVI was reported to be feasible with a  minor complication rate. In 4 patients with different forms of multiple  sclerosis venography was performed that revealed stenosis of the proximal region  of the jugular vein (right or left). Percutaneous transluminal balloon  angioplasty (PTA) was performed in all patients. There were no complications and  mean stenosis was reduced after PTA from 59.75% to 36.75%. Follow-up included  clinical observations and magnetic resonance imaging (MRI). In all the cases we  observed positive remission of the disease, the first ever documented case of  MRI index improvement. PTA seems to be an effective treatment for patients with  CCVI and multiple sclerosis, However, randomized studies are warranted to  establish the efficacy of this new treatment for MS.', ""PURPOSE: To assess the safety of endovascular treatment of chronic cerebrospinal  venous insufficiency (CCSVI) in patients with multiple sclerosis (MS). MATERIALS AND METHODS: A total of 72 patients with CCSVI and MS (44 with  relapsing remitting--RR, 4 with primary progressive, 20 with secondary  progressive and 4 with benign MS) underwent percutaneous angioplasty. Outcome  measures were colour Doppler ultrasonography parameters, gradient pressure at  the vein abnormality level, postoperative complications, re-stenosis, disease  severity scored by means of Expanded Disability Status Scale (EDSS) and  patients' assumption of disease status. Controls were done after one month on 72  patients, six months on 69 patients and one year on 61 patients, respectively  (the average follow-up was 11 months). RESULTS: There were no postoperative complications. Colour Doppler  ultrasonography showed significant improvement in cross-sectional area  parameters (P\u2009<\u20090.05) and significant decrease in confluence velocity values  (P\u2009<\u20090.05). Postoperative gradient pressure decreased, in internal jugular vein  (IJV) significantly (P\u2009<\u20090.05). Re-stenosis appeared in 5.3% of patients. EDSS  score was significantly improved (P\u2009<\u20090.01) and about half of patients reported  significant or mild improvement in disease status and none of them worsening of  symptoms. CONCLUSION: Endovascular treatment of the IJV and azygous veins in patients with  CCSVI and MS is a safe procedure with no post-procedural complications followed  by significant improvement of IJV flow haemodynamic parameters and decrease in  the EDSS score. Whether CCSVI percutaneous treatment might affect clinical  improvement in patients suffering from MS is yet to be seen after completion of  major multicentric clinical trials, still it seems like that this procedure is  not negligible."", 'Chronic impaired venous outflow from the central nervous system has recently  been claimed to be associated with multiple sclerosis (MS) pathology. This  resulted in the term chronic cerebrospinal venous insufficiency (CCSVI) in MS.  The concept of CCSVI is based on sonography studies showing that impaired venous  outflow leading to pathological reflux is almost exclusively present in MS  patients but not in healthy controls. Based on these findings, a new  pathophysiological concept has been introduced suggesting that chronic venous  outflow obstruction and venous reflux in the CNS result in pathological iron  depositions leading to inflammation and neurodegeneration. The theory of CCSVI  in MS has rapidly generated tremendous interest in the media and among patients  and the scientific community. In particular, the potential shift in treatment  concepts possibly leading to an interventional treatment approach including  balloon angioplasty and venous stent placement is currently being debated.  However, results from recent studies involving several imaging modalities have  raised substantial concerns regarding the CCSVI concept in MS. In this review  article, we explain the concept of CCSVI in MS and discuss this hypothesis in  the context of MS pathophysiology and imaging studies which have tried to  reproduce or refute this theory. In addition, we draw some major conclusions  focusing in particular on the crucial question as to whether interventional  treatment options are expedient. In conclusion, the present conclusive data  confuting the theory of CCSVI in MS should lead to reluctance with respect to  the interventional treatment of possible venous anomalies in MS patients.', 'Multiple sclerosis (MS) is a disorder characterized by damage to the myelin  sheath insulation of nerve cells of the brain and spinal cord affecting nerve  impulses which can lead to numerous physical and cognitive disabilities. The  disease, which affects over 500,000 people in the United States alone, is widely  believed to be an autoimmune condition potentially triggered by an antecedant  event such as a viral infection, environmental factors, a genetic defect or a  combination of each. Chronic cerebrospinal venous insufficiency (CCSVI) is a  condition characterized by abnormal venous drainage from the central nervous  system that has been theorized to have a possible role in the pathogenesis and  symptomatology of MS (1). A significant amount of attention has been given to  this theory as a possible explanation for the etiology of symptoms related to MS  patients suffering from this disease. The work of Dr. Zamboni, et al, who  reported that treating the venous stenoses causing CCSVI with angioplasty  resulting in significant improvement in the symptoms and quality of life of  patients with MS (2) has led to further interest in this theory and potential  treatment. The article presented describes endovascular techniques employed to  diagnose and treat patients with MS and CCSVI.', ""BACKGROUND: Multiple sclerosis (MS) is a leading cause of neurological  disability in young adults. The most widely accepted hypothesis regarding its  pathogenesis is that it is an immune-mediated disease. It has been hypothesised  more recently that chronic venous congestion may be an important factor in the  pathogenesis of MS. This concept has been named 'chronic cerebrospinal venous  insufficiency' (CCSVI) and is characterised by stenoses of either the internal  jugular or azygos veins, or both. It is suggested that these stenoses restrict  the normal blood flow from the brain, causing the deposition of iron in the  brain and the eventual triggering of an auto-immune response. The proposed  treatment for CCSVI is percutaneous transluminal angioplasty, also known as the  'liberation procedure', which is claimed to improve the blood flow in the brain  thereby alleviating some of the symptoms of MS. OBJECTIVES: To assess the effects of percutaneous transluminal angioplasty for  the treatment of CCSVI in people with MS. SEARCH METHODS: We searched the following databases up to June 2012: The  Cochrane Multiple Sclerosis and Rare Diseases of the Central Nervous System  Group Specialised Register, CENTRAL in The Cochrane Library 2012, Issue 5,  MEDLINE (from 1946), EMBASE (from 1974), and reference lists of articles. We  also searched several online trials registries for ongoing trials. SELECTION CRITERIA: Randomised controlled trials assessing the effects of  percutaneous transluminal angioplasty in adults with multiple sclerosis, that  have been diagnosed to have CCSVI. DATA COLLECTION AND ANALYSIS: Our searches retrieved 159 references, six of  which were to ongoing trials. Based on assessment of the title or abstract, or  both, we excluded all of the studies, with the exception of one which was  evaluated following examination of the full text report. However, this study  also did not meet our inclusion criteria and was subsequently excluded. MAIN RESULTS: No randomised controlled trials met our inclusion criteria. AUTHORS' CONCLUSIONS: There is currently no high level evidence to support or  refute the efficacy or safety of percutaneous transluminal angioplasty for  treatment of CCSVI in people with MS. Clinical practice should be guided by  evidence supported by well-designed randomised controlled trials: closure of  some of the gaps in the evidence may be feasible at the time of completion of  the six ongoing clinical trials."", ""Chronic cerebrospinal venous insufficiency (CCSVI) has been implicated as a  contributing factor to multiple sclerosis (MS). This theory is strongly debated  within the neurology and radiology communities.

The patient reported dramatic  improvement of symptoms after intervention. The stent thrombosed despite  antithrombotic medication, and several endovascular interventions failed to  restore long-term patency. Open venous reconstruction of the internal jugular  vein was performed with a spiral graft from the saphenous vein. The patient's  symptoms improved for several weeks until the venous reconstruction occluded.  This case is the first reported open venous reconstruction for suspected CCSVI.""]","The so-called ""LIberation therapy"" is in fact Endovascular Treatment and consists of PTA (Percutaneous Transluminal Angioplasty), which is dilatation of the internal jugular and/or azygous veins by a catheter venography.

76,Is phospholamban a regulatory/inhibitory protein of the Ca ATPase SERCA?,"['Phospholamban (PLB) inhibits the sarcoplasmic reticulum (SR) Ca(2+)-ATPase  (SERCA), and this inhibition is relieved by Ca(2+) calmodulin-dependent protein  kinase II (CaM kinase II) phosphorylation. We previously reported significant  differences in contractility, SR Ca(2+) release, and CaM kinase II activity in  gastric fundus smooth muscles as a result of PLB phosphorylation by CaM kinase  II. In this study, we used PLB-knockout (PLB-KO) mice to directly examine the  effect of PLB absence on contractility, CaM kinase II activity, and  intracellular Ca(2+) waves in gastric antrum smooth muscles. The frequencies and  amplitudes of spontaneous phasic contractions were elevated in antrum smooth  muscle strips from PLB-KO mice. Bethanecol increased the amplitudes of phasic  contractions in antrum smooth muscles from both control and PLB-KO mice.  Caffeine decreased and cyclopiazonic acid (CPA) increased the basal tone of  antrum smooth muscle strips from PLB-KO mice, but the effects were less  pronounced compared with control strips. The CaM kinase II inhibitor KN-93 was  less effective at inhibiting caffeine-induced relaxation in antrum smooth muscle  strips from PLB-KO mice. CaM kinase II autonomous activity was elevated, and not  further increased by caffeine, in antrum smooth muscles from PLB-KO mice.  Similarly, the intracellular Ca(2+) wave frequency was elevated, and not further  increased by caffeine, in antrum smooth muscles from PLB-KO mice. These findings  suggest that PLB is an important modulator of gastric antrum smooth muscle  contractility by modulation of SR Ca(2+) release and CaM kinase II activity.', 'Phospholamban has been suggested to be a key regulator of cardiac sarcoplasmic  reticulum (SR) Ca cycling and contractility and a potential therapeutic target  in restoring the depressed Ca cycling in failing hearts. Our understanding of  the function of phospholamban stems primarily from studies in genetically  altered mouse models. To evaluate the significance of this protein in larger  mammalian species, which exhibit Ca cycling properties similar to humans, we  overexpressed phospholamban in adult rabbit cardiomyocytes. Adenoviral-mediated  gene transfer, at high multiplicities of infection, resulted in an insignificant  1.22-fold overexpression of phospholamban. There were no effects on twitch  Ca-transient amplitude or decay under basal or isoproterenol-stimulated  conditions. Furthermore, the SR Ca load and Na/Ca exchanger function were not  altered. These apparent differences between phospholamban overexpression in  rabbit compared with previous findings in the mouse may be due to a  significantly higher (1.5-fold) endogenous phospholamban-to-sarco(endo)plasmic  reticulum Ca-ATPase (SERCA) 2a ratio and potential functional saturation of  SERCA2a by phospholamban in rabbit cardiomyocytes. The findings suggest that  important species-dependent differences in phospholamban regulation of SERCA2a  occur. In larger mammals, a higher fraction of SERCA2a pumps are regulated by  phospholamban, and this may influence therapeutic strategies to enhance cardiac  contractility and functional cardiac reserve.', 'Phospholamban (PLB) is an integral membrane protein regulating Ca(2+) transport  through inhibitory interaction with sarco(endo)plasmic reticulum calcium ATPase  (SERCA). The Asn27 to Ala (N27A) mutation of PLB has been shown to function as a  superinhibitor of the affinity of SERCA for Ca(2+) and of cardiac contractility  in vivo. The effects of this N27A mutation on the side-chain and backbone  dynamics of PLB were investigated with (2)H and (15)N solid-state NMR  spectroscopy in phospholipid multilamellar vesicles (MLVs). (2)H and (15)N NMR  spectra indicate that the N27A mutation does not significantly change the  side-chain or backbone dynamics of the transmembrane and cytoplasmic domains  when compared to wild-type PLB. However, dynamic changes are observed for the  hinge region, in which greater mobility is observed for the CD(3)-labeled Ala24  N27A-PLB. The increased dynamics in the hinge region of PLB upon N27A mutation  may allow the cytoplasmic helix to more easily interact with the Ca(2+)-ATPase;  thus, showing increased inhibition of Ca(2+)-ATPase.', '1. Phospholamban (PLB) is an inhibitor of the sarcoplasmic reticulum (SR)  Ca2+-ATPase (SERCA). Its presence and/or functional significance in  contractility of bladder, a smooth muscle tissue particularly dependent on SR  function, is unknown. We investigated this by measuring the effects of carbachol  (CCh) on force and [Ca2+]i in bladder from mice in which the PLB gene was  ablated (PLB-KO mice). In the PLB-KO bladder, the maximum increases in [Ca2+]i  and force were significantly decreased (41.5 and 47.4 % of WT), and the EC50  values increased. 2. Inhibition of SERCA with cyclopiazonic acid (CPA) abolished  these differences between WT and PLB-KO bladder, localizing the effects to the  SR. 3. To determine whether these effects were specific to PLB, we generated  mice with smooth-muscle-specific expression of PLB (PLB-SMOE mice), using the  SMP8 alpha-actin promoter. Western blot analysis of PLB-SMOE mice showed  approximately an eightfold overexpression of PLB while SERCA was downregulated  12-fold. 4. In PLB-SMOE bladders, in contrast, the response of [Ca2+]i and force  to CCh was significantly increased and the EC50 values were decreased. CPA had  little affect on the CCh-induced increases in [Ca2+]i and force in PLB-SMOE  bladder. 5. These results show that alteration of the PLB:SERCA ratio can  significantly modulate smooth muscle [Ca2+]i. Importantly, our data show that  PLB can play a major role in modulation of bladder contractility.', 'Phospholamban (PLN) is a type II membrane protein that inhibits the sarcoplasmic  reticulum Ca(2+)-ATPase (SERCA), thereby regulating calcium homeostasis in  cardiac muscle. In membranes, PLN forms pentamers that have been proposed to  function either as a storage for active monomers or as ion channels. Here, we  report the T-state structure of pentameric PLN solved by a hybrid solution and  solid-state NMR method. In lipid bilayers, PLN adopts a pinwheel topology with a  narrow hydrophobic pore, which excludes ion transport. In the T state, the  cytoplasmic amphipathic helices (domains Ia) are absorbed into the lipid bilayer  with the transmembrane domains arranged in a left-handed coiled-coil  configuration, crossing the bilayer with a tilt angle of approximately 11° with  respect to the membrane normal. The tilt angle difference between the monomer  and pentamer is approximately 13°, showing that intramembrane helix-helix  association forces dominate over the hydrophobic mismatch, driving the overall  topology of the transmembrane assembly. Our data reveal that both topology and  function of PLN are shaped by the interactions with lipids, which fine-tune the  regulation of SERCA.', 'Phospholamban is an endogenous inhibitor of sarcoplasmic reticulum calcium  ATPase and plays a prime role in cardiac contractility and relaxation.  Phospholamban may be a candidate gene responsible for cardiomyopathy. We  investigated genome sequence of phospholamban in patients with cardiomyopathy.  PCR-based direct sequence was performed for the promoter region and the whole  coding region of phospholamban in 87 hypertrophic, 10 dilated, and 2 restricted  cardiomyopathic patients. We found a heterozygous single nucleotide transition  from A to G at -77-bp upstream of the transcription start site in the  phospholamban promoter region of one patient with familial hypertrophic  cardiomyopathy. This nucleotide change was not found in 296 control subjects.  Using neonatal rat cardiomyocytes, the mutation, -77A-->G, increased the  phospholamban promoter activity. No nucleotide change in the phospholamban  coding region was found in 99 patients with cardiomyopathy. We suspect that the  mutation plays an important role in the development of hypertrophic  cardiomyopathy.', 'The sarco(endo)plasmic reticulum calcium ATPase (SERCA) is regulated in a  tissue-dependent manner via interaction with the short integral membrane  proteins phospholamban (PLN) and sarcolipin (SLN). Although defects in SERCA  activity are known to cause heart failure, the regulatory mechanisms imposed by  PLN and SLN could have clinical implications for both heart and skeletal muscle  diseases. PLN and SLN have significant sequence homology in their transmembrane  regions, suggesting a similar mode of binding to SERCA. However, unlike PLN, SLN  has a conserved C-terminal luminal tail composed of five amino acids  ((27)RSYQY), which may contribute to a distinct SERCA regulatory mechanism. We  have functionally characterized alanine mutants of the C-terminal tail of SLN  using co-reconstituted proteoliposomes of SERCA and SLN. We found that Arg(27)  and Tyr(31) are essential for SLN function. We also tested the effect of a  truncated variant of SLN (Arg(27)stop) and extended chimeras of PLN with the  five luminal residues of SLN added to its C terminus. The Arg(27)stop form of  SLN resulted in loss of function, whereas the PLN chimeras resulted in  superinhibition with characteristics of both PLN and SLN. Based on our results,  we propose that the C-terminal tail of SLN is a distinct, essential domain in  the regulation of SERCA and that the functional properties of the SLN tail can  be transferred to PLN.', 'Sarco(endo)plasmic reticulum Ca(2+)ATPase (SERCA) pump activity is modulated by  phospholamban (PLB) and sarcolipin (SLN) in cardiac and skeletal muscle. Recent  data suggest that SLN could play a role in muscle thermogenesis by promoting  uncoupling of the SERCA pump (Lee, A.G. (2002) Curr. Opin. Struct. Biol. 12,  547-554 and Bal, N. C., Maurya, S. K., Sopariwala, D. H., Sahoo, S. K., Gupta,  S. C., Shaikh, S. A., Pant, M., Rowland, L. A., Bombardier, E., Goonasekera, S.  A., Tupling, A. R., Molkentin, J. D., and Periasamy, M. (2012) Nat. Med. 18,  1575-1579), but the mechanistic details are unknown. To better define how  binding of SLN to SERCA promotes uncoupling of SERCA, we compared SLN and SERCA1  interaction with that of PLB in detail. The homo-bifunctional cross-linker  (1,6-bismaleimidohexane) was employed to detect dynamic protein interaction  during the SERCA cycle. Our studies reveal that SLN differs significantly from  PLB: 1) SLN primarily affects the Vmax of SERCA-mediated Ca(2+) uptake but not  the pump affinity for Ca(2+); 2) SLN can bind to SERCA in the presence of high  Ca(2+), but PLB can only interact to the ATP-bound Ca(2+)-free E2 state; and 3)  unlike PLB, SLN interacts with SERCA throughout the kinetic cycle and promotes  uncoupling of the SERCA pump. Using SERCA transmembrane mutants, we additionally  show that PLB and SLN can bind to the same groove but interact with a different  set of residues on SERCA. These data collectively suggest that SLN is  functionally distinct from PLB; its ability to interact with SERCA in the  presence of Ca(2+) causes uncoupling of the SERCA pump and increased heat  production.', ""Increases in diastolic Ca2+ and impaired relaxation in failing hearts have been  suggested to reflect the deteriorated function of the sarcoplasmic reticulum  Ca-ATPase (SERCA2), whose activity is regulated by phospholamban (PLN). PLN is a  reversible inhibitor of SERCA2's Ca2+ affinity and cardiac contractility.  Studies in genetically altered mouse models have demonstrated that the levels  and the degree of PLN phosphorylation are critical in modulating basal Ca2+  handling and contractility. Correspondingly, the depressed contractility in  experimental and human heart failure is partially attributed to increased  inhibition by PLN due to: (a) increases in PLN/SERCA2; and (b) decreases in PLN  phosphorylation. The attenuated PLN phosphorylation is associated with increased  type 1 phosphatase, which reflects dephosphorylation or inactivation of its  inhibitor 1. Indeed PLN ablation was successful in rescuing cardiac remodelling  and dysfunction in several heart failure mouse models, and inhibition of the  phosphatase activity restored contractile parameters in failing rat hearts.  Recently, two human PLN mutations, associated with either absence or sustained  dephosphorylation of PLN, were linked to dilated cardiomyopathy. Thus, PLN  modulation appears to be of paramount importance in humans, and further  investigation into PLN function in higher mammalian species may provide insights  into its potential as a therapeutic modality in heart failure."", 'Heart disease remains the leading cause of death and disability in the Western  world. Current therapies aim at treating the symptoms rather than the  subcellular mechanisms, underlying the etiology and pathological remodeling in  heart failure. A universal characteristic, contributing to the decreased  contractile performance in human and experimental failing hearts, is impaired  calcium sequestration into the sarcoplasmic reticulum (SR). SR calcium uptake is  mediated by a Ca(2+)-ATPase (SERCA2), whose activity is reversibly regulated by  phospholamban (PLN). Dephosphorylated PLN is an inhibitor of SERCA and  phosphorylation of PLN relieves this inhibition. However, the initial simple  view of a PLN/SERCA regulatory complex has been modified by our recent  identification of SUMO, S100 and the histidine-rich Ca-binding protein as  regulators of SERCA activity. In addition, PLN activity is regulated by 2  phosphoproteins, the inhibitor-1 of protein phosphatase 1 and the small heat  shock protein 20, which affect the overall SERCA-mediated Ca-transport. This  review will highlight the regulatory mechanisms of cardiac contractility by the  multimeric SERCA/PLN-ensemble and the potential for new therapeutic avenues  targeting this complex by using small molecules and gene transfer methods.']","Phospholamban (PLB) is a 24- to 27-kDa phosphoprotein that modulates activity of the sarco(endo)plasmic reticulum Ca2+ ATPase (SERCA). Expression of PLB is reportedly limited to cardiac, slow-twitch skeletal and smooth muscle in which PLB is an important regulator of [Ca2+]i and contractility in these muscles.The membrane protein complex between the sarcoplasmic reticulum Ca(2+)-ATPase (SERCA) and phospholamban (PLN) controls Ca(2+) transport in cardiomyocytes, thereby modulating cardiac contractility. β-Adrenergic-stimulated phosphorylation of PLN at Ser-16 enhances SERCA activity via an unknown mechanism."
77,Is galcanezumab effective for treatment of migraine?,"['The neuropeptide calcitonin gene-related peptide is well established as a key  player in the pathogenesis of migraine. Clinical studies show calcitonin  gene-related peptide levels correlate with migraine attacks, and decreases in  this neuropeptide can indicate antimigraine therapy effectiveness. Research has  revealed a wide distribution of expression sites for calcitonin gene-related  peptide in the central and peripheral nervous system. Of these, the calcitonin  gene-related peptide receptor, which binds calcitonin gene-related peptide with  high affinity, has attracted growing interest as a viable target for  antimigraine therapies. An incentive to pursue such research is the continuing  unmet medical need of patients. Triptans have offered some clinical benefit, but  many patients do not respond and these drugs have important safety  considerations. Initial calcitonin gene-related peptide-focused research led to  development of the ""gepant"" small-molecule calcitonin gene-related peptide  receptor blockers. Positive efficacy reports concerning the gepants have been  tempered by safety findings which led to the discontinuation of some of these  agents. Currently, there is considerable excitement regarding monoclonal  antibodies against calcitonin gene-related peptide (eptinezumab, galcanezumab,  fremanezumab) and the calcitonin gene-related peptide receptor (erenumab). To  date, these monoclonal antibodies have shown promising efficacy in clinical  trials, with no major safety concerns. If ongoing long-term studies show that  their efficacy can be maintained, this may herald a new era for effective  antimigraine therapies.', 'Treatment of migraine is on the cusp of a new era with the development of drugs  that target the trigeminal sensory neuropeptide calcitonin gene-related peptide  (CGRP) or its receptor. Several of these drugs are expected to receive approval  for use in migraine headache in 2018 and 2019.\u2005CGRP-related therapies offer  considerable improvements over existing drugs as they are the first to be  designed specifically to act on the trigeminal pain system, they are more  specific and they seem to have few or no adverse effects. CGRP receptor  antagonists such as ubrogepant are effective for acute relief of migraine  headache, whereas monoclonal antibodies against CGRP (eptinezumab, fremanezumab  and galcanezumab) or the CGRP receptor (erenumab) effectively prevent migraine  attacks. As these drugs come into clinical use, we provide an overview of  knowledge that has led to successful development of these drugs. We describe the  biology of CGRP signalling, summarize key clinical evidence for the role of CGRP  in migraine headache, including the efficacy of CGRP-targeted treatment, and  synthesize what is known about the role of CGRP in the trigeminovascular system.  Finally, we consider how the latest findings provide new insight into the  central role of the trigeminal ganglion in the pathophysiology of migraine.', 'OBJECTIVE: To evaluate the efficacy and safety of galcanezumab, a humanized  monoclonal antibody that selectively binds to calcitonin gene-related peptide,  in the preventive treatment of chronic migraine. METHODS: A phase 3, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled study of  LY2951742 in patients with chronic migraine (Evaluation of Galcanezumab in the  Prevention of Chronic Migraine [REGAIN]) was a phase 3 study with a 3-month  double-blind, placebo-controlled treatment phase and a 9-month open-label  extension. Eligible patients 18 to 65 years of age with chronic migraine were  randomized 2:1:1 to monthly subcutaneous injections of placebo (n = 558),  galcanezumab 120 mg (with a 240-mg loading dose, n = 278), or galcanezumab 240  mg (n = 277). The primary endpoint was the overall mean change from baseline in  the number of monthly migraine headache days (MHDs) during the 3-month  double-blind treatment phase. RESULTS: Mean number of monthly MHDs at baseline was 19.4 for the total sample.  Both galcanezumab dose groups demonstrated greater overall mean reduction in the  number of monthly MHDs compared to placebo (placebo -2.7, galcanezumab 120 mg  -4.8, galcanezumab 240 mg -4.6) (p < 0.001 for each dose compared to placebo).  There were no clinically meaningful differences between galcanezumab doses and  placebo on any safety or tolerability outcome except for a higher incidence of  treatment-emergent injection-site reaction (p < 0.01), injection-site erythema  (p < 0.001), injection-site pruritus (p < 0.01), and sinusitis (p < 0.05) in the  galcanezumab 240-mg group relative to placebo. CONCLUSIONS: Both doses of galcanezumab were superior to placebo in reducing the  number of monthly MHDs. Galcanezumab appears efficacious, safe, and well  tolerated for the preventive treatment of chronic migraine. CLINICALTRIALSGOV IDENTIFIER: NCT02614261. CLASSIFICATION OF EVIDENCE: This interventional study provides Class I evidence  that galcanezumab is superior to placebo in the reduction of the number of  monthly MHDs.', 'Background: Calcitonin gene-related peptide (CGRP) is pivotal in the  pathophysiology of migraine headaches and represents a promising target for  migraine treatment. The humanized monoclonal antibody galcanezumab (LY2951742)  binds to CGRP and may be effective in migraine prophylaxis. Objectives: The  primary objective was to evaluate the safety and tolerability of single and  multiple doses of galcanezumab in humans. Secondary objectives included  assessing the pharmacokinetics and evaluating target engagement. Methods: A  double-blind, randomized, placebo-controlled study (NCT 01337596) with single  escalating and multiple subcutaneous (SC) doses of galcanezumab was performed in  healthy male volunteers. Single doses of 1, 5, 25, 75, 200, and 600 mg of  galcanezumab (n = 7/dose) or placebo (n = 2/dose) were injected SC in six  consecutive cohorts of nine subjects each. One cohort of nine subjects received  multiple (4) 150 mg doses of galcanezumab or placebo every other week. Target  engagement was evaluated by measuring inhibition of capsaicin-induced increase  in dermal blood flow (DBF). Findings: Sixty-three subjects were randomized and  included in the safety analyses. Galcanezumab was well tolerated in single doses  (1-600 mg SC) and consecutive doses (150 mg SC). There was no dose-dependent  difference in type or frequency of treatment-emergent adverse events, and no  clinically meaningful difference when compared with placebo. Pharmacokinetics  were linear. Galcanezumab induced a robust, dose-dependent, and durable  inhibition of capsaicin-induced increase in DBF, supporting the continued  clinical development of galcanezumab for prophylaxis in migraine patients.', 'OBJECTIVE: To characterize adult patients with episodic migraine who achieved  100% response to galcanezumab treatment. BACKGROUND: Galcanezumab is a humanized monoclonal antibody that selectively  binds to the calcitonin gene-related peptide (CGRP) and has demonstrated  efficacy in reducing migraine headache days (MHD) in patients with episodic and  chronic migraine. METHODS: A post hoc analysis of the proportion of patients with 100% response  (100% reduction from baseline in monthly MHD) was calculated for each month from  pooled data of 2 double-blind, 6-month galcanezumab studies in patients with  episodic migraine (4 to 14 MHD and ≥2 migraine attacks per month at baseline).  The patients were randomized (1:1:2) to monthly subcutaneous galcanezumab,  120\xa0mg (after 240\xa0mg initial loading dose) or 240\xa0mg, or placebo. A generalized  linear mixed model with effects for baseline MHD, treatment, month, and  treatment-by-month interaction was used to estimate the mean monthly response  rate. RESULTS: The analysis included 1739 patients treated with galcanezumab, 120\xa0mg  (n\xa0=\xa0436) or 240\xa0mg (n\xa0=\xa0428), or placebo (n\xa0=\xa0875). The mean monthly 100%  response rate on an average month in the 6-month double-blind phase was greater  for galcanezumab 120\xa0mg (13.5%) and 240\xa0mg (14.3%) groups vs placebo (5.9%) with  odds ratios of 2.5 (95% confidence interval [CI] 1.9, 3.2) and 2.6 (95% CI 2.0,  3.4), respectively (P\xa0<\xa0.001). The rate of 100% monthly response increased at  each month over the 6-month double-blind phase with higher rates for  galcanezumab dose groups (9 to 21%) than placebo (2 to 10%) (P\xa0<\xa0.02).  Evaluation of 100% response by the number of months showed a greater proportion  of galcanezumab-treated patients in either dose group, compared to placebo, were  able to achieve a 100% response (P\xa0<\xa0.001 up to 3 months); however, though  greater than placebo, few galcanezumab patients had ≥4 months of 100% response  (P\xa0<\xa0.02). The proportions of patients with 100% response were greatest in the  last 3 months of the treatment. Considering the average number days between  nonconsecutive MHD across the 6-month period (not just during the times of 100%  response), the duration of migraine headache-free periods in the galcanezumab  groups was 29 days for those with at least 1 month of 100% response and 55 days  for those with at least 3 months of 100% response. This gap was approximately 6  to 11 times greater than the mean gap of 5 days observed at baseline. CONCLUSIONS: More than a third of the patients with episodic migraine treated  with galcanezumab 120\xa0mg or 240\xa0mg achieved 100% response for at least 1 month.  More patients had 100% monthly response in the last 3 months of the 6-month  double-blind period. For those with 100% response for at least 1 month, the  average time between nonconsecutive MHD for the entire treatment period was  nearly 1 month and approached 2 months for patients with 3 or more months of  100% response.', 'BACKGROUND: Episodic cluster headache is a disabling neurologic disorder that is  characterized by daily headache attacks that occur over periods of weeks or  months. Galcanezumab, a humanized monoclonal antibody to calcitonin gene-related  peptide, may be a preventive treatment for cluster headache. METHODS: We enrolled patients who had at least one attack every other day, at  least four total attacks, and no more than eight attacks per day during a  baseline assessment, as well as a history of cluster headache periods lasting at  least 6 weeks, and randomly assigned them to receive galcanezumab (at a dose of  300 mg) or placebo, administered subcutaneously at baseline and at 1 month. The  primary end point was the mean change from baseline in the weekly frequency of  cluster headache attacks across weeks 1 through 3 after receipt of the first  dose. The key secondary end point was the percentage of patients who had a  reduction from baseline of at least 50% in the weekly frequency of cluster  headache attacks at week 3. Safety was also assessed. RESULTS: Recruitment was halted before the trial reached the planned sample size  of 162 because too few volunteers met the eligibility criteria. Of 106 enrolled  patients, 49 were randomly assigned to receive galcanezumab and 57 to receive  placebo. The mean (±SD) number of cluster headache attacks per week in the  baseline period was 17.8±10.1 in the galcanezumab group and 17.3±10.1 in the  placebo group. The mean reduction in the weekly frequency of cluster headache  attacks across weeks 1 through 3 was 8.7 attacks in the galcanezumab group, as  compared with 5.2 in the placebo group (difference, 3.5 attacks per week; 95%  confidence interval, 0.2 to 6.7; P\u2009=\u20090.04). The percentage of patients who had a  reduction of at least 50% in headache frequency at week 3 was 71% in the  galcanezumab group and 53% in the placebo group. There were no substantial  between-group differences in the incidence of adverse events, except that 8% of  the patients in the galcanezumab group had injection-site pain. CONCLUSIONS: Galcanezumab administered subcutaneously at a dose of 300 mg once  monthly reduced the weekly frequency of attacks of episodic cluster headache  across weeks 1 through 3 after the initial injection, as compared with placebo.

A population pharmacokinetic (PK) analysis was performed to  characterize galcanezumab PK using data pooled from 7 clinical studies. Clinical  studies included healthy individuals and patients with episodic or chronic  migraine who were administered between 5 and 300\xa0mg galcanezumab. The PK data  were analyzed using nonlinear mixed-effects modeling. Galcanezumab  concentration-time data were described with a 1-compartment model with  first-order absorption following subcutaneous administration and linear  elimination. At the median body weight of 74 kg, the estimated population  apparent clearance (CL/F) was 0.00785 L/h (34% IIV), the apparent volume of  distribution was 7.33 L (34% IIV), and half-life was 27 days. Patient body  weight was found to have a modest effect of CL/F, with median galcanezumab  concentrations being lower in the heaviest patients compared to the lightest  patients, but this outcome was determined not to be clinically relevant in the  context of model-estimated random variability. Dosing adjusted for body weight  is not warranted in adults. Age, sex, race/ethnicity, immunogenicity,  renal/hepatic markers, and injection-site location did not affect galcanezumab  PK. In conclusion, galcanezumab exhibits PK parameters typical for an IgG mAb  administered subcutaneously. The population PK model developed in this study  demonstrates that galcanezumab exhibits linear PK that was not influenced in a  clinically relevant manner by the patient factors evaluated.', 'OBJECTIVE: This meta-analysis was performed to evaluate the efficacy and safety  of monoclonal antibodies against calcitonin gene-related peptide (CGRP) for  episodic migraine prevention.

Studies considered to be eligible were randomized  controlled trials about efficacy and safety of calcitonin gene-related peptide  monoclonal antibody for episodic migraine prevention. RESULTS: Eight randomized controlled trials involving 2292 patients were  included. The outcomes of this meta-analysis presented that CGRP monoclonal  antibodies for preventive treatment of episodic migraine significantly reduced  the monthly migraine days from baseline [weighted mean difference  (WMD)\u2009=\u2009-\u20091.52; 95%CI, -\u20091.92 to -\u20091.11; Z\u2009=\u20097.40; P\u2009<\u20090.001] and monthly acute  migraine-specific medication consumption from baseline [WMD\u2009=\u2009-\u20091.45; 95%CI,  -\u20092.17 to -\u20090.72; Z\u2009=\u20093.93; P\u2009<\u20090.001], as compared with placebo group.

We  provide an update on published Phase 2 and Phase 3 trials, safety/tolerability  data, pharmacokinetics and mechanism of action of these biologicals. RECENT FINDINGS: The efficacy data from Phase 2 trials are corroborated by those  from published Phase 3 trials, with a multitude of publications expected in  2018. Review of safety data concluded there was no difference in total adverse  events or main adverse events (including upper respiratory tract infection,  nasopharyngitis, nausea, injection-site pain and back pain) between the mAbs and  placebo injections except apparently for dizziness. The site of action of these  mAbs is not fully elucidated but current insight is that their effect resides in  the periphery; a contribution of central effect(s) can however not be excluded  at present. SUMMARY: Although efficacy of all four drugs is modest over placebo in episodic  and chronic migraine prevention and overall comparable with available oral  preventive treatments, current tolerability and (short-term) safety data of this  new treatment approach certainly promise a major step forward for migraine  patients.', 'BACKGROUND: A substantial proportion of patients with migraine does not respond  to, or cannot tolerate, oral preventive treatments. Erenumab is a novel  CGRP-receptor antibody with preventive efficacy in migraine. We assessed its  efficacy and tolerability in patients with episodic migraine in whom previous  treatment with two-to-four migraine preventives had been unsuccessful. METHODS: LIBERTY was a 12-week, double-blind, placebo-controlled randomised  study at 59 sites in 16 countries. Eligible patients were aged 18-65 years and  had a history of episodic migraine with or without aura for at least 12 months,  had migraine for an average of 4-14 days per month during the 3 months before  screening, and had been treated unsuccessfully (in terms of either efficacy or  tolerability, or both) with between two and four preventive treatments. Eligible  participants were randomly assigned (1:1) to receive either erenumab 140 mg (via  two 70 mg injections) or placebo every 4 weeks subcutaneously for 12 weeks.  Randomisation was by interactive response technology and was stratified by  monthly frequency of migraine headache (4-7 vs 8-14 migraine days per month)  during the baseline phase. Cenduit generated the randomisation list and assigned  participants to groups. Participants, investigators, people doing various  assessments, and the study sponsor were masked to treatment assignment. The  primary endpoint was the proportion of patients achieving a 50% or greater  reduction in the mean number of monthly migraine days during weeks 9-12.  Efficacy was measured in the full analysis set, which included all randomly  assigned patients who started their assigned treatment and completed at least  one post-baseline monthly migraine day measurement. Safety and tolerability were  assessed by recording adverse events and by physical examination, assessment of  vital signs, clinical laboratory assessments, and electrocardiography. Safety  was assessed in all randomly assigned patients who received at least one dose of  study drug. This trial is registered with ClinicalTrials.gov, number  NCT03096834. The trial is closed to new participants, but the open-label  extension phase is ongoing. FINDINGS: Between March 20, 2017, and Oct 27, 2017, 246 participants were  randomly assigned, 121 to the erenumab group and 125 to the placebo group. 95 of  246 (39%) participants had previously unsuccessfully tried two preventive drugs,  93 (38%) had tried three, and 56 (23%) had tried four. At week 12, 36 (30%)  patients in the erenumab had a 50% or greater reduction from baseline in the  mean number of monthly migraine days, compared with 17 (14%) in the placebo  group (odds ratio 2·7 [95% CI 1·4-5·2]; p=0·002). The tolerability and safety  profiles of erenumab and placebo were similar. The most frequent  treatment-emergent adverse event was injection site pain, which occurred in  seven (6%) participants in both groups. INTERPRETATION: Compared with placebo, erenumab was efficacious in patients with  episodic migraine who previously did not respond to or tolerate between two and  four previous migraine preventive treatments. Erenumab might be an option for  patients with difficult-to-treat migraine who have high unmet needs and few  treatment options. FUNDING: Novartis Pharma.']",Yes.

78,Which drug can be reversed with idarucizumab?,"['BACKGROUND: Specific reversal agents for non-vitamin K antagonist oral  anticoagulants are lacking. Idarucizumab, an antibody fragment, was developed to  reverse the anticoagulant effects of dabigatran. METHODS: We undertook this prospective cohort study to determine the safety of 5  g of intravenous idarucizumab and its capacity to reverse the anticoagulant  effects of dabigatran in patients who had serious bleeding (group A) or required  an urgent procedure (group B). The primary end point was the maximum percentage  reversal of the anticoagulant effect of dabigatran within 4 hours after the  administration of idarucizumab, on the basis of the determination at a central  laboratory of the dilute thrombin time or ecarin clotting time. A key secondary  end point was the restoration of hemostasis. RESULTS: This interim analysis included 90 patients who received idarucizumab  (51 patients in group A and 39 in group B). Among 68 patients with an elevated  dilute thrombin time and 81 with an elevated ecarin clotting time at baseline,  the median maximum percentage reversal was 100% (95% confidence interval, 100 to  100). Idarucizumab normalized the test results in 88 to 98% of the patients, an  effect that was evident within minutes. Concentrations of unbound dabigatran  remained below 20 ng per milliliter at 24 hours in 79% of the patients. Among 35  patients in group A who could be assessed, hemostasis, as determined by local  investigators, was restored at a median of 11.4 hours. Among 36 patients in  group B who underwent a procedure, normal intraoperative hemostasis was reported  in 33, and mildly or moderately abnormal hemostasis was reported in 2 patients  and 1 patient, respectively. One thrombotic event occurred within 72 hours after  idarucizumab administration in a patient in whom anticoagulants had not been  reinitiated. CONCLUSIONS: Idarucizumab completely reversed the anticoagulant effect of  dabigatran within minutes.

For patients who present with an  acute stroke despite dabigatran therapy, clinical data on the use of intravenous  tissue plasminogen activator (IV-tPA) is limited. There is an anticipated  increased risk of symptomatic intracranial hemorrhage (sICH) when using IV-tPA  in patients on dabigatran therapy. In 2015, the humanized monoclonal antibody  fragment idarucizumab was approved for rapid (minutes) reversal of anticoagulant  effects of dabigatran. Dabigatran reversal with idarucizumab before  administration of IV-tPA might reduce the risk of sICH. We report a case of a  69-year-old stroke patient on dabigatran for paroxysmal atrial fibrillation who  presented with an initial National Institutes of Health Stroke Scale (NIHSS) of  12. There was no early evidence of ischemic stroke or hemorrhage on head  computed tomography, and coagulation studies implied therapeutic dabigatran  levels. After controlling blood pressure, dabigatran was reversed with  idarucizumab, and IV-tPA was administrated beginning 197\u2009minutes after he was  last seen at his baseline. Subsequent brain magnetic resonance imaging showed 2  punctate infarcts in the left temporal lobe and occipital lobe with no evidence  of hemorrhage. The patient was discharged with an NIHSS of 1. Telephone  follow-up 2 months later indicated that he was at his prestroke baseline, except  for a complaint of worsened short-term memory. Idarucizumab reversal of  dabigatran may reduce the risk of sICH and should be considered for acute stroke  patients arriving in the IV-tPA time window.', 'Direct oral anticoagulants (DOACs) offer noninferior efficacy and improved  safety compared to vitamin K antagonists (VKAs) for the prevention and treatment  of venous thromboembolism and for the prevention of stroke and systemic embolism  in nonvalvular atrial fibrillation. Unlike VKAs, DOACs do not require routine  laboratory monitoring of anticoagulant effect and dose adjustment. In certain  situations, however, laboratory assessment of anticoagulant effect may be  desirable. Here we review the utility of currently available assays for  assessment of DOAC effect and recommend an optimal assessment strategy for each  drug, including calibrated dilute thrombin time or ecarin-based assays for  dabigatran and calibrated anti-Xa activity assays for the factor Xa inhibitors.  We also discuss reversal strategies, both specific and nonspecific, for each  drug, including the preferential use of idarucizumab for the reversal of  dabigatran and two agents, andexanet and ciraparantag, currently under  development for the reversal of rivaroxaban, apixaban, and edoxaban.', 'Idarucizumab is a monoclonal antibody fragment specifically targeted to  dabigatran. It has demonstrated prompt and durable reversal of the anticoagulant  effects of dabigatran in animal studies and phase 1 studies of young, elderly,  and renally impaired volunteers. Although elective invasive procedures and most  bleeding complications in dabigatran-treated patients can be managed by  temporarily stopping dabigatran therapy and using supportive measures, there are  rare clinical situations that require urgent reversal of the anticoagulant  effect of dabigatran. The effectiveness and safety of 5 g of intravenous  idarucizumab is being investigated in a prospective, open-label, single-cohort  study in patients with serious bleeding or in those requiring an urgent  procedure. In an interim analysis of the first 90 participants, idarucizumab  rapidly and completely reversed the anticoagulant activity of dabigatran in  88%-98% of participants, and there were no safety concerns, with no deaths or  serious adverse events being attributable to idarucizumab. Supported by these  interim results, idarucizumab has been approved in the United States and the  European Union for use when reversal of the anticoagulant effects of dabigatran  is needed for emergency surgery/urgent procedures or in patients with  life-threatening or uncontrolled bleeding. Clinical use of idarucizumab should  follow the same processes as patient enrollment in this study, which is  projected to be completed in 2016. The outcomes achieved with this specific  reversal agent are likely to be of continued interest to treating physicians.', 'OBJECTIVE: To evaluate the role of idarucizumab, a humanized monoclonal antibody  fragment, as a specific reversal agent for the anticoagulant activity of  dabigatran and to review the pharmacology, pharmacokinetic properties, efficacy,  and safety of this agent. METHODS: A literature search was conducted consisting of a PubMed database using  the MeSH term idarucizumab and the key word dabigatran antidote. Studies  evaluating the pharmacology, pharmacokinetics, safety, and efficacy of  idarucizumab for the reversal of the anticoagulant activity of dabigatran were  included. RESULTS: Idarucizumab represents a novel treatment option as it is the only  humanized, monoclonal antibody fragment that specifically binds to dabigatran.  Studies evaluating reversal of dabigatran-induced anticoagulation have  demonstrated immediate, complete, and sustained effects with idarucizumab.  Idarucizumab did not overcorrect thrombin generation. Additionally, evaluations  have shown that dabigatran can be safely reinitiated 24 hours after the  administration of idarucizumab. The United States Food and Drug Administration  granted priority review for the biologic license application and accelerated  approval for idarucizumab. CONCLUSION: Idarucizumab represents an encouraging development in the reversal  of dabigatran. Its novel mechanism of action, pharmacokinetics, tolerability,  and lack of thrombotic events contribute positively to its use in patients who  experience bleeding or for those who require emergent surgery or procedures.', 'The new oral anticoagulants have many advantages over vitamin K antagonists, but  they are still associated with a troublesome incidence of major bleeding.  Additionally, the absence of a reversal agent for the new oral anticoagulants is  a barrier to their more widespread use. Currently, there are 3 potential  reversal agents in development: idarucizumab is a humanized murine monoclonal  antibody fragment directed specifically at dabigatran; andexanet alfa is a  recombinant modified decoy factor Xa that binds to factor Xa inhibitors; and  PER977 is a small molecule that binds to factor Xa and IIa inhibitors and to  heparin-based anticoagulants through charge interaction. These agents have  undergone phase I clinical testing, appear to be well tolerated in healthy  volunteers, and are effective in neutralizing their respective targets. All 3  are currently undergoing or entering into a phase II or III clinical study. This  article reviews the available data for idarucizumab, andexanet alfa, and PER977.', 'The use of direct oral anticoagulants over traditional warfarin has increased in  the United States over the past 10 years because of advantages such as ease of  use, predictable pharmacokinetic response, and safety. In 2015, the U.S. Food  and Drug Administration approved idarucizumab (Praxbind) for the reversal of the  direct thrombin inhibitor dabigatran, but no reversal agent has been available  for oral factor Xa (FXa) inhibitors until recently. Andexanet alfa was approved  in May 2018, under the brand name ANDEXXA, for the reversal of 2 of FXa  inhibitors, apixaban and rivaroxaban, when life-threatening or uncontrolled  bleeding occurs. This accelerated approval was based on change in anti-FXa  activity from baseline that indicated a reversal of the anticoagulant effect.  Any expanded Food and Drug Administration indication will be contingent on  results demonstrating improved hemostasis and efficacy for reversing other FXa  inhibitors.', 'AIMS: Upadacitinib (ABT-494) is a selective Janus kinase 1 inhibitor being  developed for treatment of auto-immune inflammatory disorders. This work  evaluated effects of high-fat meal, cytochrome P450 (CYP) 3A inhibition, CYP  induction, and organic anion transporting polypeptide (OATP) 1B inhibition on  upadacitinib pharmacokinetics. METHODS: Two Phase 1 evaluations were conducted, each in 12 healthy subjects. In  Study 1, using a randomized, two-sequence crossover design, a 3\xa0mg dose of  upadacitinib (immediate-release capsules) was administered alone under fasting  conditions, after high-fat meal, or on Day 4 of a 6-day regimen of 400\xa0mg  once-daily ketoconazole. In Study 2, a 12\xa0mg upadacitinib dose was administered  alone, with the first, and with the eighth dose of a 9-day regimen of rifampin  600\xa0mg once daily. Upadacitinib plasma concentrations were characterized. RESULTS: Administration of upadacitinib immediate-release capsules after a  high-fat meal decreased upadacitinib Cmax by 23% and had no impact on  upadacitinib AUC relative to the fasting conditions. Ketoconazole (strong CYP3A  inhibitor) increased upadacitinib Cmax and AUC by 70% and 75%, respectively.  Multiple doses of rifampin (broad CYP inducer) decreased upadacitinib Cmax and  AUC by approximately 50% and 60%, respectively. A single dose of rifampin (also  an OATP1B inhibitor) had no effect on upadacitinib AUC. Upadacitinib was well  tolerated when co-administered with ketoconazole, rifampin, or after a high-fat  meal. CONCLUSIONS: Strong CYP3A inhibition and broad CYP induction result in a weak  and moderate effect, respectively, on upadacitinib exposures. OATP1B inhibition  and administration of upadacitinib immediate-release formulation with food does  not impact upadacitinib exposure.', 'PURPOSE: The available clinical data on target-specific oral anticoagulant  (TSOAC) reversal agents that are currently in development or have been approved  by the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) are reviewed. SUMMARY: The development of TSOACs such as dabigatran, rivaroxaban, edoxaban,  and apixaban has presented benefits and new challenges. One of the main  challenges associated with the use of TSOACs is the lack of suitable  agent-specific reversal agents. Several treatment options for the management of  life-threatening bleeding events associated with TSOAC use, such as fresh frozen  plasma, prothrombin complex concentrates, and recombinant coagulation factor  VIIa, have been used, with inconsistent results. Currently, two potential  reversal agents for oral direct factor Xa inhibitors (andexanet alfa and  ciraparantag) are at various stages of clinical development. Idarucizumab, a  reversal agent for the oral direct thrombin inhibitor dabigatran, was approved  by FDA in October 2015. Idarucizumab and andexanet alfa have been reported to  produce anticoagulation reversal effects within minutes of administration.  Ciraparantag was demonstrated to decrease whole blood clotting time to within  10% of baseline values in 10 minutes or less, with a return to baseline  hemostasis in 10-30 minutes. TSOAC reversal agents have been generally well  tolerated in clinical trials. CONCLUSION: Idarucizumab and other TSOAC reversal agents, such as andexanet alfa  and ciraparantag, present the potential for consistent and effective treatment  and management options when life-threatening or uncontrolled TSOAC-associated  bleeding occurs or when emergency surgery is warranted in patients using TSOACs.', '1.\u2002Idasanutlin (RG7388) is a potent p53-MDM2 antagonist currently in clinical  development for treatment of cancer. The purpose of the present studies was to  investigate the cause of marked decrease in plasma exposure after repeated oral  administration of RG7388 in monkeys and whether the autoinduction observed in  monkeys is relevant to humans. 2.\u2002In monkey liver and intestinal microsomes  collected after repeated oral administration of RG7388 to monkeys, significantly  increased activities of homologue CYP3A8 were observed (ex vivo). Investigation  using a physiologically based pharmacokinetic (PBPK) model suggested that the  loss of exposure was primarily due to induction of metabolism in the gut of  monkeys. 3.\u2002Studies in monkey and human primary hepatocytes showed that CYP3A  induction by RG7388 only occurred in monkey hepatocytes but not in human  hepatocytes, which suggests the observed CYP3A induction is monkey specific.  4.\u2002The human PK data obtained from the first cohorts confirmed the lack of  relevant induction as predicted by the human hepatocytes and the PBPK modelling  based on no induction in humans.']",Idarucizumab is an antibody fragment that specifically reverses dabigatran mediated anticoagulation.
79,Proteomic analyses have revealed proteins associated with the triple-negative breast cancers. List some proposed proteins.,"['Breast cancer is by far the most common diagnosed form of cancer and the leading  cause of cancer death in women today. Clinically useful biomarkers for early  detection of breast cancer could lead to a significant reduction in mortality.  Here we describe a detailed analysis using gel-based proteomics in combination  with mass spectrometry and immunohistochemistry (IHC) of the tumour interstitial  fluids (TIF) and normal interstitial fluids (NIF) collected from 69 prospective  breast cancer patients. The goal of this study was to identify abundant cancer  up-regulated proteins that are externalised by cells in the tumour  microenvironment of most if not all these lesions. To this end, we applied a  phased biomarker discovery research strategy to the analysis of these samples  rather than comparing all samples among each other, with inherent inter and  intra-sample variability problems. To this end, we chose to use samples derived  from a single tumour/benign tissue pair (patient 46, triple negative tumour),  for which we had well-matched samples in terms of epithelial cell numbers, to  generate the initial dataset. In this first phase we found 110 proteins that  were up-regulated by a factor of 2 or more in the TIF, some of which were  confirmed by IHC. In the second phase, we carried out a systematic computer  assisted analysis of the 2D gels of the remaining 68 TIF samples in order to  identify TIF 46 up-regulated proteins that were deregulated in 90% or more of  all the available TIFs, thus representing common breast cancer markers. This  second phase singled out a set of 26 breast cancer markers, most of which were  also identified by a complementary analysis using LC-MS/MS. The expression of  calreticulin, cellular retinoic acid-binding protein II, chloride intracellular  channel protein 1, EF-1-beta, galectin 1, peroxiredoxin-2, platelet-derived  endothelial cell growth factor, protein disulfide isomerase and ubiquitin  carboxyl-terminal hydrolase 5 were further validated using a tissue microarray  containing 70 malignant breast carcinomas of various grades of atypia. A  significant number of these proteins have already been detected in the  blood/plasma/secretome by others. The next steps, which include biomarker  prioritization based on the hierarchal evaluation of these markers, antibody and  antigen development, assay development, analytical validation, and preliminary  testing in the blood of healthy and breast cancer patients, are discussed.', 'PURPOSE: To identify molecular markers of pathologic response to neoadjuvant  paclitaxel/radiation treatment, protein and gene expression profiling were done  on pretreatment biopsies. EXPERIMENTAL DESIGN: Patients with high-risk, operable breast cancer were  treated with three cycles of paclitaxel followed by concurrent  paclitaxel/radiation. Tumor tissue from pretreatment biopsies was obtained from  19 of the 38 patients enrolled in the study. Protein and gene expression  profiling were done on serial sections of the biopsies from patients that  achieved a pathologic complete response (pCR) and compared to those with  residual disease, non-pCR (NR). RESULTS: Proteomic and validation immunohistochemical analyses revealed that  alpha-defensins (DEFA) were overexpressed in tumors from patients with a pCR.  Gene expression analysis revealed that MAP2, a microtubule-associated protein,  had significantly higher levels of expression in patients achieving a pCR.  Elevation of MAP2 in breast cancer cell lines led to increased paclitaxel  sensitivity. Furthermore, expression of genes that are associated with the  basal-like, triple-negative phenotype were enriched in tumors from patients with  a pCR. Analysis of a larger panel of tumors from patients receiving presurgical  taxane-based treatment showed that DEFA and MAP2 expression as well as  histologic features of inflammation were all statistically associated with  response to therapy at the time of surgery. CONCLUSION: We show the utility of molecular profiling of pretreatment biopsies  to discover markers of response. Our results suggest the potential use of immune  signaling molecules such as DEFA as well as MAP2, a microtubule-associated  protein, as tumor markers that associate with response to neoadjuvant  taxane-based therapy.', 'We have begun an early phase of biomarker discovery in three clinically  important types of breast cancer using a panel of human cell lines: HER2  positive, hormone receptor positive and HER2 negative, and triple negative  (HER2-, ER-, PR-). We identified and characterized the most abundant secreted,  sloughed, or leaked proteins released into serum free media from these breast  cancer cell lines using a combination of protein fractionation methods before  LC-MS/MS mass spectrometry analysis. A total of 249 proteins were detected in  the proximal fluid of 7 breast cancer cell lines. The expression of a selected  group of high abundance and/or breast cancer-specific potential biomarkers  including thromobospondin 1, galectin-3 binding protein, cathepsin D, vimentin,  zinc-α2-glycoprotein, CD44, and EGFR from the breast cancer cell lines and in  their culture media were further validated by Western blot analysis.  Interestingly, mass spectrometry identified a cathepsin D protein  single-nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) by alanine to valine replacement from the  MCF-7 breast cancer cell line. Comparison of each cell line media proteome  displayed unique and consistent biosignatures regardless of the individual group  classifications, demonstrating the potential for stratification of breast  cancer. On the basis of the cell line media proteome, predictive Tree software  was able to categorize each cell line as HER2 positive, HER2 negative, and  hormone receptor positive and triple negative based on only two proteins, muscle  fructose 1,6-bisphosphate aldolase and keratin 19. In addition, the predictive  Tree software clearly identified MCF-7 cell line overexpresing the HER2 receptor  with the SNP cathepsin D biomarker.', 'Triple-negative breast cancer is difficult to treat because of the lack of  rationale-based therapies. There are no established markers and targets that can  be used for stratification of patients and targeted therapy. Here we report the  identification of novel molecular features, which appear to augment metastasis  of triple negative breast tumors. We found that triple-negative breast tumors  can be segregated into 2 phenotypes based on their genome-wide protein abundance  profiles. The first is characterized by high expression of Stat1, Mx1, and CD74.  Seven out of 9 tumors from this group had invaded at least 2 lymph nodes while  only 1 out of 10 tumors in group 2 was lymph node positive. In vitro experiments  showed that the interferon-induced increase in Stat1 abundance correlates with  increased migration and invasion in cultured cells. When CD74 was overexpressed,  it increased cell adhesion on matrigel. This effect was accompanied with a  marked increase in the membrane expression of beta-catenin, MUC18, plexins,  integrins, and other proteins involved in cell adhesion and cancer metastasis.  Taken together, our results show that Stat1/CD74 positive triple-negative tumors  are more aggressive and suggest an approach for development of better  diagnostics and more targeted therapies for triple negative breast cancer. This  article is part of a Special Issue entitled: Proteomics: The clinical link.', 'We compared the protein expression pattern of triple-negative breast carcinomas  (HER2-, ER-, PR-) versus those being positive for HER2 and negative for the  hormone receptors (HER2+, ER-, PR-) by 2-D DIGE and mass spectrometry. We  obtained differential expression patterns for several glycolytic enzymes (as for  example MDH2, PGK1, TKT, Aldolase1), cytokeratins (CK7, 8, 9, 14, 17, 19),  further structure proteins (vimentin, fibronectin, L-plastin), for NME1-NME2,  lactoferrin, and members of the Annexin family. Western blot analysis and  immunohistochemistry were conducted to verify the results. The identified marker  proteins may advance a more detailed characterization of triple-negative breast  cancers and may contribute to the development of better treatment strategies.', 'OBJECTIVES: To use proteomics to identify and characterize proteins in maternal  serum from patients at high-risk for fetal trisomy 21, trisomy 18, and trisomy  13 on the basis of ultrasound and maternal serum triple tests. METHODS: We performed a comprehensive proteomic analysis on 23 trisomy cases and  85 normal cases during the early second trimester of pregnancy. Protein  profiling along with conventional sodium dodecyl sulfate polyacrylamide gel  electrophoresis/Tandem mass spectrometry analysis was carried out to  characterize proteins associated with each trisomy condition and later validated  using Western blot. RESULTS: Protein profiling approach using surface enhanced laser  desorption/ionization time-of-flight mass (SELDI-TOF/MS) spectrometry resulted  in the identification of 37 unique hydrophobic proteomic features for three  trisomy conditions. Using sodium dodecyl sulfate polyacrylamide gel  electrophoresis followed by Matrix Assisted Laser Desorption Ionization - Time  of Flight/Time of Flight (MALDI-TOF/TOF) and western blot, glyco proteins such  as alpha-1-antitrypsin, apolipoprotein E, apolipoprotein H, and serum carrier  protein transthyretin were identified as potential maternal serum markers for  fetal trisomy condition. The identified proteins showed differential expression  at the subunit level. CONCLUSIONS: Maternal serum protein profiling using proteomics may allow  non-invasive diagnostic testing for the most common trisomies and may complement  ultrasound-based methods to more accurately determine pregnancies with fetal  aneuploidies.', 'BACKGROUND AND AIMS: We used a proteomics array to simultaneously measure  multiple proteins that have been suggested to be associated with atherosclerosis  and related them to plaque prevalence in carotid arteries in a human  population-based study. METHODS: In the Prospective Study of the Vasculature in Uppsala Seniors (PIVUS;  n = 931, 50% women, all aged 70 years), the number of carotid arteries with  plaques was recorded by ultrasound. Levels of 82 proteins were assessed in  plasma by a proximity extension assay (Proseek Multiplex CVD, Olink Bioscience,  Uppsala, Sweden) and related to carotid measures in a regression framework. RESULTS: Following adjustment for multiple testing with Bonferroni correction,  seven of the proteins were significantly related to the number of carotid  arteries affected by plaques in sex-adjusted models (osteoprotegrin, T-cell  immunoglobulin and mucin domain (TIM)-1, growth/differentiation factor 15  (GDF-15), matrix metalloprotease-12 (MMP-12), renin, tumor necrosis factor  ligand superfamily member 14 (TNFSF14) and growth hormone). Of these, renin  (odds ratio [OR], 1.30; 95% confidence interval [CI], 1.13-1.49 per standard  deviation increase), growth hormone (OR, 1.24; 95% CI, 1.08-1.43),  osteoprotegerin (OR, 1.22; 95% CI, 1.05-1.43) and TNFSF14 (OR, 1.17; 95% CI,  1.01-1.35) were related to plaque prevalence independently of each other and  traditional cardiovascular risk factors. CONCLUSION: A novel targeted proteomics approach using the proximity extension  technique discovered several new associations of candidate proteins with carotid  artery plaque prevalence in a large human sample.', 'BACKGROUND: Triple-negative breast cancers (TNBC) do not represent a single  disease subgroup and are often aggressive breast cancers with poor prognoses.  Unlike estrogen/progesterone receptor and HER2 (human epidermal growth factor  receptor 2) breast cancers, which are responsive to targeted treatments, there  is no effective targeted therapy for TNBC, although approximately 50% of  patients respond to conventional chemotherapies, including taxanes,  anthracyclines, cyclophosphamide, and platinum salts. CONTENT: Genomic studies have helped clarify some of the possible disease  groupings that make up TNBC. We discuss the findings, including copy  number-transcriptome analysis, whole genome sequencing, and exome sequencing, in  terms of the biological properties and phenotypes that make up the constellation  of TNBC. The relationships between subgroups defined by transcriptome and genome  analysis are discussed. SUMMARY: TNBC is not a uniform molecular or disease entity but a constellation  of variably well-defined biological properties whose relationship to each other  is not understood. There is good support for the existence of a basal expression  subtype, p53 mutated, high-genomic instability subtype of TNBC. This should be  considered a distinct TNBC subtype. Other subtypes with variable degrees of  supporting evidence exist within the nonbasal/p53wt (wild-type p53) TNBC,  including a group of TNBC with PI3K (phosphoinositide 3-kinase) pathway  activation that have better overall prognosis than the basal TNBC. Consistent  molecular phenotyping of TNBC by whole genome sequencing, transcriptomics, and  functional studies with patient-derived tumor xenograft models will be essential  components in clinical and biological studies as means of resolving this  heterogeneity.', 'The development of metastasis is a complex, multistep process that remains  poorly defined. To identify proteins involved in the colonization phase of the  metastatic process, we compared the proteome of tumors derived from inoculation  of a panel of isogenic human cancer cell lines with different metastatic  capabilities into the mammary fat pad of immunodeficient mice. Using a protein  standard generated by SILAC-labeling, a total of 675 proteins were identified  and 30 were differentially expressed between at least two of the tumors. The  protein standard contained the proteomes of seven cell lines from multiple  histogenic origins and displayed superior features compared to standard  super-SILAC. The expression of some proteins correlated with metastatic  capabilities, such as myosin-9 (nonmuscle myosin II A) and L-lactate  dehydrogenase A, while the expression of elongation factor tu correlated  inversely to metastatic capabilities. The expression of these proteins was  biochemically validated, and expression of myosin-9 in clinical breast cancer  samples was further shown to be altered in primary tumors versus corresponding  lymph node metastasis. Our study demonstrates an improved strategy for  quantitative comparison of an unlimited number of tumor tissues, and provides  novel insights into key proteins associated with the colonization phase of  metastasis formation.', 'About 5000 (25%) of the ~20400 human protein-coding genes currently lack any  experimental evidence at the protein level. For many others, there is only  little information relative to their abundance, distribution, subcellular  localization, interactions, or cellular functions. The aim of the HUPO Human  Proteome Project (HPP, www.thehpp.org ) is to collect this information for every  human protein. HPP is based on three major pillars: mass spectrometry (MS),  antibody/affinity capture reagents (Ab), and bioinformatics-driven knowledge  base (KB). To meet this objective, the Chromosome-Centric Human Proteome Project  (C-HPP) proposes to build this catalog chromosome-by-chromosome ( www.c-hpp.org  ) by focusing primarily on proteins that currently lack MS evidence or Ab  detection.

80,What is Jackhammer esophagus?,"['BACKGROUND/AIMS: Jackhammer esophagus is an uncommon heterogeneous motility  disorder associated with a distal contractile integral > 8000 mmHg∙sec∙cm. The  spectrum of abnormality ranges from a relatively normal looking contraction to  chaotic repetitive contractions akin to a jackhammer. Although previous studies  have shown an uncertain correlation between peristaltic vigor and symptoms, we  hypothesize that symptoms may be more severe with repetitive contractions as  opposed to an elevated contractile measure. Thus, this study aims to investigate  whether symptom severity is related to the contraction pattern in the patients  with hypercontractile esophagus. METHODS: Patients with hypercontractile esophagus were retrospectively  identified, their demographic and high-resolution manometry characteristics were  collected. Contraction pattern on high-resolution manometry was categorized into  single-peak and multiple-peak. Comparison was performed between patients with  single-peak and multiple-peak. RESULTS: Altogether 35 patients (age range, 45-70 years; female:male, 24:11)  were included. Seven patients presented with single-peak hypercontractile  swallows, while 28 patients presented with multiple-peak hypercontractile  swallows. The patients with multiple-peak showed higher Brief Esophageal  Dysphagia Questionnaire scores compared with patients with single-peak. The  jackhammer swallows with multiple-peak were associated with higher distal  contractile integral values, longer distal latency intervals, and a lower  integrated relaxation pressure. CONCLUSIONS: Repetitive contractions akin to a jackhammer were common amongst  patients with hypercontractile esophagus. Patients with the jackhammer pattern  also presented with more severe symptoms. Further distinction of  hypercontractile esophagus into a jackhammer dominant subtype may be warranted.', 'BACKGROUND: Jackhammer esophagus is a rare esophageal motility disorder that can  result in dysphagia, chest pain, and gastro-esophageal reflux symptoms.  High-resolution manometry is the gold standard for diagnosis, while corkscrew  esophagus on upper gastrointestinal endoscopy is an uncommon manifestation. CASE PRESENTATION: 72-year-old man who presented with progressive dysphagia for  three months without symptoms of chest pain or heartburn. Initial workup showed  a corkscrew esophagus on upper gastrointestinal endoscopy; subsequently,  high-resolution manometry revealed an esophago-gastric junction outflow  obstruction with hypercontractile (jackhammer) esophagus. Treatment with calcium  channel blockers and proton pump inhibitors was successful and relieved his  symptoms near completion. CONCLUSIONS: Even though the corkscrew esophagus is typically for distal  esophageal spasm, the hypercontractile (jackhammer) esophagus can appear. The  high-resolution manometry can help to distinguish each specific motility  disorder.', 'Hypercontractile esophagus (nicknamed jackhammer esophagus) is a recently  defined disease within the esophageal motility disorders classification.  Responses to treatments for jackhammer esophagus have been inconsistent in  previous trials, possibly due to its heterogeneous manifestation. Thus, we  reviewed 10 patients diagnosed with jackhammer esophagus and compared their  clinical and manometric features at baseline. Additionally, manometric and  symptomatic responses after treatment with known smooth muscle relaxants,  including anticholinergic drugs (cimetropium bromide and scopolamine  butylbromide) and a phosphodiesterase-5 inhibitor (sildenafil) were compared. We  observed two distinct subgroups in the findings: one with hypercontractility and  normal distal latencies (""classic jackhammer esophagus,"" n=7) and the other with  hypercontractility and short distal latencies (""spastic jackhammer esophagus,""  n=3). The two types also differed in their responses to medications in that  symptoms improved upon treatment with an anticholinergic agent in classic  jackhammer esophagus patients, while spastic jackhammer esophagus was  unresponsive to both the anticholinergic drugs and the phosphodiesterase-5  inhibitor. In conclusion, hypercontractile esophagus may be a heterogeneous  disease with different underlying pathophysiologies. We introduced two novel  terms, ""classic jackhammer esophagus"" and ""spastic jackhammer esophagus,"" to  distinguish the two types.', 'Hypercontractile esophagus (HE), also known as jackhammer esophagus, is an  esophageal motility disorder. Nowadays, high-resolution manometry (HRM) is used  to diagnose the disorder. According to the latest iteration of the Chicago  classification, HE is present when at least 2 out 10 liquid swallow-induced  peristaltic waves have an abnormally high Distal Contractile Integral. In the  era of conventional manometry, a similar condition, referred to as nutcracker  esophagus, was diagnosed when the peristaltic contractions had an abnormally  high mean amplitude. Although the HRM diagnosis of HE is relatively  straight-forward, effective management of the disorder is challenging as the  correlation with symptoms is variable and treatment effects are dubious. In this  mini-review, we discuss the most troublesome uncertainties that still surround  HE, in the light of new data on etiology and epidemiology published in this  issue of Neurogastroenterology and Motility.', ""Jackhammer esophagus (JE) is a recently recognized esophageal motility disorder  that is characterized by hypercontractile peristalsis. More than 500 cases have  been reported in the literature. Among patients referred for esophageal motility  disorders, the prevalence of JE ranges from 0.42% to 9%, with most series  describing a prevalence of 2% to 4%. Most cases are women (60.5%). The mean  reported age of patients with JE is 65.2 years, and patients commonly have  dysphagia (62.8%). Reflux symptoms occur in ∼40% of patients, and chest pain  affects more than one-third of patients (36.4%). JE is a heterogenous disorder  that is associated with several conditions, including obesity, opioid use, lung  transplantation, eosinophilic infiltration of the esophagus, neoplasia, and  systemic diseases. The cause and pathogenesis remain unknown, but several  observations suggest that it is the result of multiple conditions that likely  precipitate increased excitation and abnormal inhibition of neuromuscular  function. The natural course of JE also is unknown, but progression to achalasia  has been observed in a few patients. Treatment is challenging, in part because  of the insufficient understanding of the disorder's underlying mechanisms.  Various therapeutic modalities have been used, ranging from observation only to  pharmacologic and endoscopic interventions (eg, botulinum toxin injection) to  peroral endoscopic myotomy. Treatment efficacy remains largely anecdotal and  insufficiently studied."", 'The concept of esophageal spastic disorders encompasses spastic achalasia,  distal esophageal spasm, and jackhammer esophagus. These are conceptually  distinct in that spastic achalasia and distal esophageal spasm are characterized  by a loss of neural inhibition, whereas jackhammer esophagus is associated with  hypercontractility. Hypercontractility may also occur as a result of  esophagogastric junction outflow obstruction or inflammation. The diagnosis of  jackhammer esophagus as a primary motility disorder is based on the  characteristic manometric findings after ruling out mechanical obstruction and  eosinophilic esophagitis. Despite the differences in pathophysiology among the  esophageal spastic disorders, their management is similar.', 'Jackhammer esophagus (JE) is a hypercontractile disorder, the pathogenesis of  which is incompletely understood. Multiple rapid swallows (MRS) and rapid drink  challenge (RDC) are complementary tests used during high-resolution manometry  (HRM) that evaluate inhibitory and excitatory neuromuscular function and latent  obstruction, respectively. Our aim was to evaluate esophageal pathophysiology  using MRS and RDC in 83 JE patients (28 men; median age: 63 yr; IQR: 54-70 yr).  Twenty-one healthy subjects (11 men; median age: 28 yr; range: 26-30 yr) were  used as a control group. All patients underwent solid-state HRM with ten 5-ml  single swallows (SS) and one to three 10-ml MRS; 34 patients also underwent RDC.  Data are shown as median (interquartile range). Abnormal motor inhibition was  noted during at least one MRS test in 48% of JE patients compared with 29% of  controls ( P = 0.29). Mean distal contractile integral (DCI) after MRS was  significantly lower than after SS [6,028 (3,678-9,267) mmHg·cm·s vs. 7,514  (6,238-9,197) mmHg·cm·s, P = 0.02], as was highest DCI ( P < 0.0001).  Consequently, 66% of JE patients had no contraction reserve. At least one  variable of obstruction during RDC (performed in 34 patients) was outside the  normal range in 25 (74%) of JE patients. Both highest DCI after SS and pressure  gradient across the esophagogastric junction (EGJ) during RDC were higher in  patients with dysphagia versus those without ( P = 0.04 and 0.01, respectively).  Our data suggest altered neural control in JE patients with heterogeneity in  inhibitory function. Furthermore, some patients had latent EGJ obstruction  during RDC, which correlated with the presence of dysphagia. NEW & NOTEWORTHY  Presence of abnormal inhibition was observed during multiple rapid swallows  (MRS) in some but not all patients with jackhammer esophagus (JE). Unlike  healthy subjects, JE patients were more strongly stimulated after single  swallows than after MRS. An obstructive pattern was frequently observed during  rapid drink challenge (RDC) and was related to presence of dysphagia. MRS and  RDC during high-resolution manometry are useful to show individual  pathophysiological patterns in JE and may guide optimal therapeutic strategies.', 'Corkscrew esophagus (also referred as rosary bead esophagus) is a classic  finding of diffuse esophageal spasm (DES) in barium studies reflecting abnormal  contractions, leading to compartmentalization and curling of the esophagus,  ultimately giving an appearance similar to a corkscrew or rosary beads. We  review the pathophysiology of this finding, correlating it to corkscrew and  rosary images that originated this classic description.', '""Corkscrew oesophagus"" is characterised on the basis of two case reports and  attention is drawn to thoracic pain of oesophageal origin. Corkscrew oesophagus  is a radiological diagnosis and is characterised by twisted segments in the  distal third of the oesophagus. The condition can sometimes be demonstrated  endoscopically and it is due to a basic disturbance in the motility of the  oesophagus. Painful conditions in the oesophagus are most frequently caused by  gastro-oesophageal reflux or disturbances in motility and the latter is  frequently complicated by reflux oesophagitis. Pain of oesophageal origin is  frequently a diagnosis by exclusion and requires exclusion of ischaemic heart  disease. The initial treatment should be directed to the reflux oesophagitis.  The diagnosis and information about the origin of the pain and the benign course  of the condition will calm the majority of the patients and remove their fear of  a possible fatal heart disease.', 'Gastroesophageal reflux disease (GERD), commonly manifested by heartburn or  regurgitation, is a chronic, progressive condition in which failed sphincter  function allows the contents of the stomach to reflux into the esophagus, the  airways and the mouth. Chronic GERD affects 10% of Western society. The majority  of patients receive adequate relief from proton pump inhibitors, but up to 40%  have incomplete relief of symptoms that cannot be addressed by increasing the  dose of medications. The laparoscopic Nissen fundoplication is the surgical gold  standard; however, the level of technical difficulty and its side effects have  limited its use to less than 1% of the GERD population. These factors have  contributed to the propensity of patients to persist with medical therapy, even  when inadequate to control symptoms and complications of the disease.  Consequently, a significant gap in the treatment continuum for GERD remains  evident in current clinical practice. The LINX(™) Reflux Management System  (Torax Medical) is designed to provide a permanent solution to GERD by  augmenting the physiologic function of the sphincter barrier with a simple and  reproducible laparoscopic procedure that does not alter gastric anatomy and can  be easily reversed if necessary.']",Jackhammer esophagus (JE) is a hypercontractile esophageal motor disorder defined by at least two swallows with a distal contractile integral (DCI) >8000 mm Hg.s.cm during high-resolution manometry (HRM).
81,From which tissue was the NCI-H520 cell-line derived?,"['Humoral hypercalcemia of malignancy, a frequent complication of squamous cell  carcinomas of the lung, is mediated by the parathyroid hormone-related peptide  (PTHrP). This study was undertaken to determine whether 1,25-dihydroxyvitamin  D(3) [1,25(OH)(2)D(3)] and two nonhypercalcemic analogues. EB1089 and  22-oxa-1,25(OH)(2)D(3) (OCT), suppress PTHrP gene expression in a human lung  squamous cancer cell line, NCI H520. All three compounds (1) decreased  steady-state PTHrP mRNA and secreted peptide levels via a transcriptional  mechanism; (2) modulated promoter activity of 1,25(OH)(2)D(3)-responsive DNA  sequences; and (3) activated the vitamin D receptor (VDR) both in vitro and in  vivo. Thus, EB1089 and OCT inhibit PTHrP gene expression in NCI H520 cells and  modulate gene expression through the same mechanism as 1,25(OH)(2)D(3), namely,  activation of the VDR. 1,25(OH)(2)D(3) is hypercalcemic in vivo. However, the  noncalcemic analogues EB1089 and OCT have a therapeutic potential through  suppression of PTHrP gene transcription.', 'Connective tissue growth factor (CTGF) is a secreted protein that belongs to CCN  family. The proteins in this family are implicated in various biological  processes, such as angiogenesis, adhesion, migration, and apoptosis. In this  study, we explored the roles of CTGF in lung tumorigenesis. The expression  levels of CTGF in 58 lung cancer samples were reduced by >2 fold in 57% of the  samples compared with matched normal samples using real-time reverse  transcription-PCR. These results were confirmed by immunohistochemical staining  for CTGF in normal lung epithelia and lung cancer. Cellular proliferation was  inhibited in non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) cell lines NCI-H460, NCI-H520,  NCI-H1299, and SK-MES-1 by CTGF overexpression. Partially purified CTGF  suppressed lung cancer cell growth. The growth inhibition caused by CTGF  overexpression was associated with growth arrest at G(0)-G(1) and prominent  induction of p53 and ADP ribosylation factor. Most interestingly, overexpression  of CTGF suppressed insulin-like growth factor-I-dependent Akt phosphorylation  and epidermal growth factor-dependent extracellular signal-regulated kinase 1/2  phosphorylation. In summary, NSCLC cells expressed decreased levels of CTGF  compared with normal lung cells; this lower expression has an effect on lung  cancer cell proliferation and its cellular response to growth factors. Our data  suggest that CTGF may behave as a secreted tumor suppressor protein in the  normal lung, and its expression is suppressed in many NSCLCs.', 'Juvenile Batten disease is a neurodegenerative disease caused by accelerated  apoptotic death of photoreceptors and neurons attributable to defects in the  CLN3 gene. CLN3 is antiapoptotic when overexpressed in NT2 neuronal precursor  cells. CLN3 negatively modulates endogenous ceramide levels in NT2 cells and  acts upstream of ceramide generation. Because defects in regulation of apoptosis  are involved in the development of cancer, we evaluated the expression of CLN3  on both mRNA and protein levels in a variety of cancer cell lines and solid  colon cancer tissue. We also observed the effect of the blocking of CLN3 protein  expression on cancer cell growth, survival, ceramide production, and apoptosis  by using an adenovirus-bearing antisense CLN3 construct. We show that CLN3 mRNA  and protein are overexpressed in glioblastoma (U-373G and T98g), neuroblastoma  (IMR-32 and SK-N-MC), prostate (Du145, PC-3, and LNCaP), ovarian (SK-OV-3,  SW626, and PA-1), breast (BT-20, BT-549, and BT-474), and colon (SW1116, SW480,  and HCT 116) cancer cell lines but not in pancreatic (CAPAN and As-PC-1) or lung  (A-549 and NCI-H520) cancer cell lines. CLN3 is also up-regulated in mouse  melanoma and breast carcinoma cancer cell lines. We found CLN3 expression is  22-330% higher than in corresponding normal colon control tissue in 8 of 10  solid colon tumors. An adenovirus-expressing antisense CLN3 (Ad-AS-CLN3) blocks  CLN3 protein expression in DU-145, BT-20, SW1116, and T98g cancer cell lines as  seen by Western blot. Blocking of CLN3 expression using Ad-AS-CLN3 inhibits  growth and viability of cancer cells. It also causes elevation in endogenous  ceramide production through de novo ceramide synthesis and results in increased  apoptosis as shown by propidium iodide and JC-1 staining. This suggests that  Ad-AS-CLN3 may be an option for therapy in some cancers. More importantly these  results suggest that CLN3 is a novel molecular target for cancer drug discovery.', ""BACKGROUND: Multidrug resistance (MDR) is a main reason for paclitaxel (TAX)  treatment failure. Indirubin-3'-monoxime (IRO) and Matrine are traditional  Chinese medicines, which may reverse the resistance of tumor cells to some  chemotherapy drugs, but the relationship between paclitaxel resistance and  Matrine is still unclear. The aim of this study was to explore the potential  molecular mechanism of IRO and Matrine in reversal of TAX resistance. METHODS: In this study, MTT assay was used to measure the non-cytotoxic dosage  of IRO and Matrine on NCI-H520/TAX25 cells and determine the reversal extent of  TAX resistance under non-toxic doses. In addition, RT-PCR and Western blotting  were used to evaluate the mRNA expression and the protein level of survivin,  Oct-4, and Sox-2 in NCI-H520/TAX25 cells using semi-quantitative methods. RESULTS: There was no obvious inhibition on sensitive cell strains and  drug-resistant strains, when the final concentration was at lest 4 µmol/L for  IRO and 100 µmol/L for Matrine. So 4 µmol/L of IRO and 100 µmol/L of Matrine  were considered as the reversal dosage. When 4 µmol/L of IRO or 100 µmol/L of  Matrine were used together with TAX, the sensitivity to TAX increased evidently  in NCI-H520/TAX2 cells; the reversal rate of IRO and Matrine was about 1.92  (43.56/22.6 nmol/L) and 1.74 (43.56/25.0 nmol/L), respectively. The mRNA  expression and the protein level of survivin, Oct-4, and Sox-2 in NCI-H520/TAX25  decreased significantly (P < 0.05) after addition of IRO or Matrine in TAX  treatment, compared to that of TAX treatment alone. CONCLUSION: The decrease in both mRNA expression and protein level of survivin,  Oct-4, and Sox-2 might be the molecular mechanism, by which IRO and Matrine  mediate the reversal of TAX resistance."", 'BACKGROUND: Inactivation of retinoblastoma (RB) tumor suppressor function occurs  frequently in lung cancer. Short-hairpin RNA can be constructed to target  specific sequences and efficiently knock down protein expression. We developed a  short-hairpin RNA approach to specifically target Rb in lung cancer cells to  determine the influence of RB knockdown on proliferation. METHODS: NCI-H520 human lung cancer cells (wild-type Rb) were transfected with  pMSCVpuro-Rb3C, a plasmid containing a short-hairpin sequence targeted to human  Rb. Transfectants harboring the construct were selected with puromycin. Loss of  RB expression in selected cell populations was determined by immunoblotting.  Proliferating cells were counted to establish growth rates.  Retinoblastoma-proficient and RB-deficient tumor growth was monitored in nude  mice. RESULTS: Transfection with pMSCVpuro-Rb3C dramatically diminished RB expression  and led to aberrant expression of RB-regulated genes. Cells harboring  pMSCVpuro-Rb3C grew at an increased rate compared with control cells: 480.6 +/-  37.7 versus 159.4 +/- 36.2 (relative cell count at 12 days). Tumor growth in  nude mice also increased with RB knockdown compared with control mice: 135.2 +/-  73.6 mm3 versus 40.0 +/- 17.0 mm3 (tumor volume at 10 days). CONCLUSIONS: Inhibition of RB expression is efficiently achieved in lung cancer  cells with short-hairpin RNA. Genetic targets of RB are deregulated with RB  knockdown. Retinoblastoma depletion increases growth in vitro and in murine  xenografts. These studies indicate that even in the context of an established  tumor cell line, RB limits tumorigenic proliferation. Additionally, this model  will serve as an ideal system to evaluate the role of RB activity on therapeutic  response.', 'The cylindromatosis (CYLD) gene was originally identified as a tumor suppressor  that is mutated in familial cylindromatosis, an autosomal dominant condition  that confers a predisposition to multiple tumors of the skin appendages. CYLD  has deubiquitinating enzyme activity and inhibits the activation of  transcription factor NF-kappaB. Therefore, loss of CYLD function correlates with  tumorigenesis. Expression of CYLD has been detected in various organs, but its  expression in salivary gland tumor (SGT) is still unknown. Adenoid cystic  carcinoma (ACC) is a well known and typical malignant SGT ACC was previously  known as cylindroma in view of its marked histological resemblance to dermal  cylindroma. In this study, the expressions of CYLD and NF-kappaB mRNA in HSG, a  human SGT cell line, were found to be increased by TNF-alpha stimulation.  Immunohistochemistry clearly demonstrated the expression of CYLD and  NF-kappaB-related factors in ACC tissue.', 'Advances in the understanding of cancer cell biology and response to drug  treatment have benefited from new molecular technologies and methods for  integrating information from multiple sources. The NCI-60, a panel of 60 diverse  human cancer cell lines, has been used by the National Cancer Institute to  screen >100,000 chemical compounds and natural product extracts for anticancer  activity. The NCI-60 has also been profiled for mRNA and protein expression,  mutational status, chromosomal aberrations, and DNA copy number, generating an  unparalleled public resource for integrated chemogenomic studies. Recently,  microRNAs have been shown to target particular sets of mRNAs, thereby preventing  translation or accelerating mRNA turnover. To complement the existing NCI-60  data sets, we have measured expression levels of microRNAs in the NCI-60 and  incorporated the resulting data into the CellMiner program package for  integrative analysis. Cell line groupings based on microRNA expression were  generally consistent with tissue type and with cell line clustering based on  mRNA expression. However, mRNA expression seemed to be somewhat more informative  for discriminating among tissue types than was microRNA expression. In addition,  we found that there does not seem to be a significant correlation between  microRNA expression patterns and those of known target transcripts. Comparison  of microRNA expression patterns and compound potency patterns showed significant  correlations, suggesting that microRNAs may play a role in chemoresistance.  Combined with gene expression and other biological data using multivariate  analysis, microRNA expression profiles may provide a critical link for  understanding mechanisms involved in chemosensitivity and chemoresistance.', 'CONTEXT: CD31 (platelet-endothelial cell adhesion molecule-1; PECAM-1), an  adhesion molecule involved in the process of angiogenesis, is used as a marker  of normal and neoplastic vascularization. During the assessment of angiogenesis  and vascular invasion in a thymic carcinoid tumor, we observed unexpected  immunostaining for CD31 in perithymic brown fat nests. OBJECTIVE: To determine whether CD31 is expressed by normal and neoplastic cells  of brown fat, a tissue whose thermogenetic activity depends heavily on high  perfusion. DESIGN: Formalin-fixed, paraffin-embedded archival tissues were immunostained by  the labeled avidin-biotin method using antibodies against CD31 (clones JC70A and  1A10) after retrieval of heat-induced epitopes. Archival tissues included  perithymic, periadrenal, axillary, and neck adipose tissue in which were  embedded nests of brown fat (n = 15), hibernoma (n = 3), lipoma (n = 6),  well-differentiated liposarcoma (n = 4), and myxoid liposarcoma (n = 4). RESULTS: Invariably, multivacuolated and univacuolated adipocytes of normal  brown fat and hibernomas were intensely positive for the CD31 antigen. The  immunostaining ""decorated"" cell membranes and the membranes of intracytoplasmic  vacuoles. No expression of CD31 was found in normal adipocytes of white fat, in  neoplastic cells of lipomas, or in multivacuolated lipoblasts of  well-differentiated and myxoid liposarcomas. CONCLUSIONS: The spectrum of cell types that express CD31 is expanded to include  normal and neoplastic brown fat cells. We speculate that the expression of CD31  may play a role in the development and maintenance of the vascular network  characterizing this specialized adipose tissue. Moreover, CD31 may inhibit the  Bax-mediated apoptosis of brown fat cells. For practical purposes, CD31 may be  used as an immunohistochemical marker for distinguishing between white and brown  fat and for diagnosing hibernoma in paraffin sections.', 'Histone deacetylase (HDAC) inhibitors induce growth arrest and apoptosis in a  variety of human cancer cells. Sodium butyrate (NaB), a short chain fatty acid,  is a HDAC inhibitor and is produced in the colonic lumen as a consequence of  microbial degradation of dietary fibers. In order to dissect out the mechanism  of NaB-induced growth inhibition of cancer cells, we carried out expression  profiling of a human lung carcinoma cell line (H460) treated with NaB using a  cDNA microarray. Of the total 1728 genes analysed, there were 32 genes with a  mean expression value of 2.0-fold and higher and 66 genes with a mean expression  value 3.0-fold and lower in NaB-treated cells. For a few selected genes, we  demonstrate that their expression pattern by semiquantitative reverse  transcription-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) analysis is matching with the  results obtained by microarray analysis. Closer view at the expression profile  of NaB-treated cells revealed the downregulation of a total of 16 genes  associated with cytokine signaling, in particular, interferon gamma (IFNgamma)  pathway. In good correlation, NaB-pretreated cells failed to induce interferon  regulatory factor 1, an INFgamma target gene, efficiently upon IFNgamma  addition. These results suggest that NaB inhibits proinflammatory cytokine  signaling pathway, thus providing proof of mechanism for its anti-inflammatory  activity. We also found that NaB induced three genes, which are known metastatic  suppressors, and downregulated 11 genes, which have been shown to promote  metastasis. Upregulation of metastatic suppressor Kangai 1 (KAI1) by NaB in a  time-dependent manner was confirmed by RT-PCR analysis. The differential  regulation of metastasis-associated genes by NaB provides explanation for the  anti-invasive properties of NaB. Therefore, our study presents new evidence for  pathways regulated by NaB, thus providing evidence for the mechanism behind  anti-inflammatory and antimetastatic activities of NaB.', 'Proteomic analysis of formalin-fixed paraffin-embedded (FFPE) tissue would  enable retrospective biomarker investigations of this vast archive of  pathologically characterized clinical samples that exist worldwide. These FFPE  tissues are, however, refractory to proteomic investigations utilizing many  state of the art methodologies largely due to the high level of covalently  cross-linked proteins arising from formalin fixation. A novel tissue  microdissection technique has been developed and combined with a method to  extract soluble peptides directly from FFPE tissue for mass spectral analysis of  prostate cancer (PCa) and benign prostate hyperplasia (BPH). Hundreds of  proteins from PCa and BPH tissue were identified, including several known PCa  markers such as prostate-specific antigen, prostatic acid phosphatase, and  macrophage inhibitory cytokine-1. Quantitative proteomic profiling utilizing  stable isotope labeling confirmed similar expression levels of prostate-specific  antigen and prostatic acid phosphatase in BPH and PCa cells, whereas the  expression of macrophage inhibitory cytokine-1 was found to be greater in PCa as  compared with BPH cells.']","Non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) cell line NCI-H520.

82,Is there a role of proton beam therapy in medulloblastoma treatment?,"['PURPOSE: In this study factors are analyzed that may potentially influence the  site of failure in pediatric medulloblastoma. Patient-related, disease-related,  and treatment-related variables are analyzed with a special focus on  radiotherapy time-dose and technical factors. METHODS AND MATERIALS: Eighty-six children and adolescents with a diagnosis of  medulloblastoma were treated in Switzerland during the period 1972-1991.  Postoperative megavoltage radiotherapy was delivered to all patients. Simulation  and portal films of the whole-brain irradiation (WBI) fields were  retrospectively reviewed in 77 patients. The distance from the field margin to  the cribiform plate and to the floor of the temporal fossa was carefully  assessed and correlated with supratentorial failure-free survival. In 19  children the spine was treated with high-energy electron beams, the remainder  with megavoltage photons. Simulation and port films of the posterior fossa  fields were also reviewed in 72 patients. The field size and the field limits  were evaluated and correlated with posterior fossa failure-free survival. RESULTS: In 36 patients (47%) the WBI margins were judged to miss the inferior  portion of the frontal and temporal lobes. Twelve patients failed in the  supratentorial region and 9 of these patients belonged to the group of 36  children in whom the inferior portion of the brain had been underdosed. On  multivariate analysis only field correctness was retained as being significantly  correlated with supratentorial failure-free survival (p = 0.049). Neither the  total dose to the spinal theca nor the treatment technique (electron vs. photon  beams) were significantly correlated with outcome. Posterior fossa failure-free  survival was not influenced by total dose, overall treatment time, field size,  or field margin correctness. Overall survival was not influenced by any of the  radiotherapy-related technical factors. CONCLUSION: A correlation between WBI field correctness and supratentorial  failure-free survival was observed. Treatment protocols should be considered  that limit supratentorial irradiation mainly to subsites at highest risk of  relapse. Optimized conformal therapy or proton beam therapy may help to reach  this goal. Treating the spine with electron beams was not deletereous. A  significant correlation between local control and other technical factors was  not observed, including those relating to posterior fossa treatment. The use of  small conformal tumor bed boost fields may be prefered to the larger posterior  fossa fields usually considered as the standard treatment approach.', 'Embryonal brain tumors are a heterogeneous group of neoplasms that primarily  occur in infants and young children. They are highly cellular tumors with brisk  mitotic activity, and they share a propensity for dissemination throughout the  neuroaxis. Emerging molecular data enable improved diagnostic and prognostic  discrimination for these tumors. Because of their aggressive potential, they are  treated similarly with multimodality therapy including maximal safe resection,  chemotherapy, and age- and risk-adapted radiotherapy. Craniospinal irradiation  is commonly used in the treatment of these patients, especially in those older  than 3 years. Because proton therapy allows for increased sparing of the  anterior structures in craniospinal irradiation, there is a particular interest  in using proton therapy to treat these young patients. For very young patients  treated with focal fields only, proton therapy also decreases unnecessary  radiation exposure to uninvolved intracranial structures. It is hoped that the  use of proton therapy for these vulnerable patients will translate into  decreased long-term neurocognitive, endocrine, vascular, and developmental  effects, in addition to a decreased risk of second malignancies. This review  describes the role of radiation in general and proton therapy in particular for  the treatment of medulloblastoma, central nervous system primitive  neuroectodermal tumors, atypical teratoid/rhabdoid tumors, and the recently  described embryonal tumor with multilayered rosettes.', 'PURPOSE: We report on a radiation treatment technique that has reduced the dose  to critical normal structures in children with medulloblastoma. PATIENTS AND METHODS: Three children between the ages of 3 and 4 with stage M2  or M3 medulloblastoma were treated between 2001 and 2003 with craniospinal  irradiation using protons. Patients received 36 cobalt gray equivalent to the  craniospinal axis, then 18 cobalt gray equivalent to the posterior fossa. The  cranium was treated with opposed lateral fields. The spine was treated with  three matched posteroanterior fields, with the beam stopping just beyond the  thecal sac. The posterior fossa was then treated with alternating  posteroanterior, right posterior oblique, and left posterior oblique fields,  with the beam stopping just proximal to the cochlea. The use of general  anesthesia and pre-porting with diagnostic-quality x-rays allowed precise  patient positioning. RESULTS: Craniospinal irradiation delivered via conformal proton irradiation  substantially reduced the dose to the cochlea and vertebral bodies and virtually  eliminated the exit dose through thorax, abdomen, and pelvis. Despite concurrent  chemotherapy, a clinically significant lymphocyte count reduction was not seen.  Patients tolerated treatment well; acute side effects (e.g., nausea, decreased  appetite, and odynophagia) were mild. All patients completed therapy without  interruption. CONCLUSION: Our proton-beam technique for craniospinal irradiation of pediatric  medulloblastoma has successfully reduced normal-tissue doses and acute  treatment-related sequelae. This technique may be especially advantageous in  children with a history of myelosuppression, who might not other wise tolerate  irradiation.', 'The aim of this treatment planning comparison study was to explore different  spinal irradiation techniques with respect to the risk of late side-effects,  particularly radiation-induced cancer. The radiotherapy techniques compared were  conventional photon therapy, intensity modulated x-ray therapy (IMXT),  conventional electron therapy, intensity/energy modulated electron therapy  (IMET) and proton therapy (IMPT).CT images for radiotherapy use from five  children, median age 8 and diagnosed with medulloblastoma, were selected for  this study. Target volumes and organs at risk were defined in 3-D. Treatment  plans using conventional photon therapy, IMXT, conventional electron therapy,  IMET and IMPT were set up. The probability of normal tissue complication (NTCP)  and the risk of cancer induction were calculated using models with  parameters-sets taken from published data for the general population; dose data  were taken from dose volume histograms (DVH). Similar dose distributions in the  targets were achieved with all techniques but the absorbed doses in the  organs-at-risk varied significantly between the different techniques. The NTCP  models based on available data predicted very low probabilities for side-effects  in all cases. However, the effective mean doses outside the target volumes, and  thus the predicted risk of cancer induction, varied significantly between the  techniques. The highest lifetime risk of secondary cancers was estimated for  IMXT (30%). The lowest risk was found with IMPT (4%). The risks associated with  conventional photon therapy, electron therapy and IMET were 20%, 21% and 15%,  respectively. This model study shows that spinal irradiation of young children  with photon and electron techniques results in a substantial risk of  radiation-induced secondary cancers. Multiple beam IMXT seems to be associated  with a particularly high risk of secondary cancer induction. To minimise this  risk, IMPT should be the treatment of choice. If proton therapy is not  available, advanced electron therapy may provide a better alternative.', ""BACKGROUND: Proton therapy has been a hotly contested issue in both scientific  publications and lay media. Proponents cite the modality's ability to spare  healthy tissue, but critics claim the benefit gained from its use does not  validate its cost compared with photon therapy. The objective of this study was  to evaluate the cost effectiveness of proton therapy versus photon therapy in  the management of pediatric medulloblastoma. METHODS: A cost-effective analysis was performed from the societal perspective  using a Monte Carlo simulation model. A population of pediatric medulloblastoma  survivors aged 18 years was studied who had received treatment at age 5 years  and who were at risk of developing 10 adverse events, such as growth hormone  deficiency, coronary artery disease, ototoxicity, secondary malignant neoplasm,  and death. Costing data included the cost of investment and the costs of  diagnosis and management of adverse health states from institutional and  Medicare data. Longitudinal outcomes data and recent modeling studies informed  risk parameters for the model. Incremental cost-effectiveness ratios were used  to measure outcomes. RESULTS: Results from the base case demonstrated that proton therapy was  associated with higher quality-adjusted life years and lower costs; therefore,  it dominated photon therapy. In 1-way sensitivity analyses, proton therapy  remained the more attractive strategy, either dominating photon therapy or  having a very low cost per quality-adjust life year gained. Probabilistic  sensitivity analysis illustrated the domination of proton therapy over photon  therapy in 96.4% of simulations. CONCLUSIONS: By using current risk estimates and data on required capital  investments, the current study indicated that proton therapy is a cost-effective  strategy for the management of pediatric patients with medulloblastoma compared  with standard of care photon therapy."", 'PURPOSE: One of the components of radiotherapy (RT) in medulloblastoma/primitive  neuroectodermal tumors is the prophylactic irradiation of the whole brain (WBI).  With the aim of reducing late neuropsychologic morbidity a CT-scan-based  dosimetric study was undertaken in which treatment was confined mainly or  exclusively to supratentorial sites considered at high risk for disease  recurrence. METHODS AND MATERIALS: A comparative dosimetric study is presented in which a  three field (two laterals and one posterior) proton plan (spot scanning method)  is compared with a two-field conventional WBI 6 MV x-ray plan, to a 6-field  ""hand-made"" 6 MV x-ray plan, and to a computer-optimized 9-field ""inverse"" 15 MV  x-ray plan. For favorable patients, 30 Gy were delivered to the ventricles and  main cisterns, the subfrontal and subtemporal regions, and the posterior fossa.  For the unfavorable patients, 10 Gy WBI preceeded a boost to 30 Gy to the same  treatment volume chosen for favorable patients. The dose distribution was  evaluated with dose-volume histograms to examine the coverage of the targets as  well as the dose to the nontarget brain and optical structures. In addition, the  risks of radiation-related late neuropsychologic effects after WBI were  collected from the literature and used to predict normal tissue complication  probabilities (NTCPs) for an intelligence quotient deficit after treatment with  photon or proton beams. RESULTS: Proton beams succeeded better in reducing the dose to the brain  hemispheres and eye than any of the photon plans. A 25.1% risk of an IQ score  <90 was predicted after 30 Gy WBI. Almost a 10% drop in the predicted risk was  observed when using proton beams in both favorable and unfavorable patients.  However, predicted NTCPs for both optimized photon plans (""hand made"" and  ""inverse"") were only slightly higher (0.3-2.5%) than those of proton beams. An  age-modifying factor was introduced in the predictive NTCP model to assess for  IQ differences in relation with age at irradiation. Children with ages between  age 4 to 8 benefitted most from the dose reduction in this exercise (similar  NTCP predictions for both proton and ""inverse"" plans). CONCLUSION: Modulated proton beams may help to significantly reduce the  irradiation of normal brain while optimally treating the supratentorial subsites  at higher risk for relapse. A decrease in morbidity can be expected from protons  and both optimized proton plans compared to WBI.', 'PURPOSE: To calculate treatment plans and compare the dose distributions and  dose-volume histograms (DVHs) for photon three-dimensional conformal radiation  therapy (3D-CRT), electron therapy, intensity-modulated radiation therapy  (IMRT), and standard (nonintensity modulated) proton therapy in three pediatric  disease sites. METHODS AND MATERIALS: The tumor volumes from 8 patients (3 retinoblastomas, 2  medulloblastomas, and 3 pelvic sarcomas) were studied retrospectively to compare  DVHs from proton therapy with 3D-CRT, electron therapy, and IMRT. In  retinoblastoma, several planning techniques were analyzed: A single electron  appositional beam was compared with a single 3D-CRT lateral beam, a 3D-CRT  anterior beam paired with a lateral beam, IMRT, and protons. In medulloblastoma,  three posterior fossa irradiation techniques were analyzed: 3D-CRT, IMRT, and  protons. Craniospinal irradiation (which consisted of composite plans of both  the posterior fossa and craniospinal components) was also evaluated, primarily  comparing spinal irradiation using 3D-CRT electrons, 3D-CRT photons, and  protons. Lastly, in pelvic sarcoma, 3D-CRT, IMRT, and proton plans were  assessed. RESULTS: In retinoblastoma, protons resulted in the best target coverage  combined with the most orbital bone sparing (10% was the mean orbital bone  volume irradiated at > or =5 Gy for protons vs. 25% for 3D-CRT electrons, 69%  for IMRT, 41% for a single 3D lateral beam, 51% for a 3D anterolateral beam with  a lens block, and 65% for a 3D anterolateral beam without a lens block). A  single appositional electron field was the next best technique followed by other  planning approaches. In medulloblastoma, for posterior fossa and craniospinal  irradiation, protons resulted in the least dose to the cochlea (for only  posterior fossa irradiation at > or =20 Gy, 34% was the mean cochlear volume  irradiated for protons, 87% for IMRT, 89% for 3D-CRT) and hypothalamus-pituitary  axis (for only posterior fossa irradiation at > or =10 Gy, 21% was the mean  hypothalamus-pituitary volume irradiated for protons, 81% for IMRT, 91% for  3D-CRT); additional dose reductions to the optic chiasm, eyes, vertebrae,  mandible, thyroid, lung, kidneys, heart, and liver were seen.  Intensity-modulated radiotherapy appeared to be the second best technique for  posterior fossa irradiation. For spinal irradiation 3D-CRT electrons were better  than 3D-CRT photons in sparing dose to the thyroid, heart, lung, kidney, and  liver. With pelvic sarcoma, protons were superior in eliminating any dose to the  ovaries (0% of mean ovarian volume was irradiated at > or =2 Gy with protons)  and to some extent, the pelvic bones and vertebrae. Intensity-modulated  radiotherapy did show more bladder dose reduction than the other techniques in  pelvic sarcoma irradiation. CONCLUSIONS: In the diseases studied, using various techniques of 3D-CRT,  electrons, IMRT, and protons, protons are most optimal in treating  retinoblastomas, medulloblastomas (posterior fossa and craniospinal), and pelvic  sarcomas. Protons delivered superior target dose coverage and sparing of normal  structures. As dose-volume parameters are expected to correlate with acute and  late toxicity, proton therapy should receive serious consideration as the  preferred technique for the treatment of pediatric tumors.', 'BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: Brain tumours are the most frequent solid tumours in  children and the most frequent radiotherapy indications in paediatrics, with  frequent late effects: cognitive, osseous, visual, auditory and hormonal. A  better protection of healthy tissues by improved beam ballistics, with particle  therapy, is expected to decrease significantly late effects without decreasing  local control and survival. This article reviews the scientific literature to  advocate indications of protontherapy and carbon ion therapy for childhood  central nervous system cancer, and estimate the expected therapeutic benefits. MATERIALS AND METHODS: A systematic review was performed on paediatric brain  tumour treatments using Medline (from 1966 to March of 2014). To be included,  clinical trials had to meet the following criteria: age of patients 18 years or  younger, treated with radiation, and report of survival. Studies were also  selected according to the evidence level. A secondary search of cited references  found other studies about cognitive functions, quality of life, the comparison  of photon and proton dosimetry showing potential dose escalation and/or sparing  of organs at risk with protontherapy; and studies on dosimetric and technical  issues related to protontherapy. RESULTS: A total of 7051 primary references published were retrieved, among  which 40 clinical studies and 60 papers about quality of life, dose distribution  and dosimetry were analysed, as well as the ongoing clinical trials. These  papers have been summarized and reported in a specific document made available  to the participants of a final 1-day workshop. Tumours of the meningeal envelop  and bony cranial structures were excluded from the analysis. Protontherapy  allows outstanding ballistics to target the tumour area, while substantially  decreasing radiation dose to the normal tissues. There are many indications of  protontherapy for paediatric brain tumours in curative intent, either for  localized treatment of ependymomas, germ-cell tumours, craniopharyngiomas,  low-grade gliomas; or panventricular irradiation of pure non-secreting  germinoma; or craniospinal irradiation of medulloblastomas and metastatic pure  germinomas. Carbon ion therapy is just emerging and may be studied for highly  aggressive and radioresistant tumours, as an initial treatment for diffuse  brainstem gliomas, and for relapse of high-grade gliomas. CONCLUSION: Both protontherapy and carbon ion therapy are promising for  paediatric brain tumours. The benefit of decreasing late effects without  altering survival has been described for most paediatric brain tumours with  protontherapy and is currently assessed in ongoing clinical trials with  up-to-date proton devices. Unfortunately, in 2015, only a minority of paediatric  patients in France can receive protontherapy due to the lack of equipment.', 'Pediatric patients who received radiation therapy are at risk of developing side  effects such as radiogenic second cancer. We compared proton and photon  therapies in terms of the predicted risk of second cancers for a 4 year old  medulloblastoma patient receiving craniospinal irradiation (CSI). Two CSI  treatment plans with 23.4 Gy or Gy (RBE) prescribed dose were computed: a  three-field 6 MV photon therapy plan and a four-field proton therapy plan. The  primary doses for both plans were determined using a commercial treatment  planning system. Stray radiation doses for proton therapy were determined from  Monte Carlo simulations, and stray radiation doses for photon therapy were  determined from measured data. Dose-risk models based on the Biological Effects  of Ionization Radiation VII report were used to estimate the risk of second  cancer in eight tissues/organs. Baseline predictions of the relative risk for  each organ were always less for proton CSI than for photon CSI at all attained  ages. The total lifetime attributable risk of the incidence of second cancer  considered after proton CSI was much lower than that after photon CSI, and the  ratio of lifetime risk was 0.18. Uncertainty analysis revealed that the  qualitative findings of this study were insensitive to any plausible changes of  dose-risk models and mean radiation weighting factor for neutrons. Proton  therapy confers lower predicted risk of second cancer than photon therapy for  the pediatric medulloblastoma patient.', ""The number of patients treated by proton beam therapy in Japan since 2000 has  increased; in 2016, 11 proton facilities were available to treat patients.  Notably, proton beam therapy is very useful for pediatric cancer; since the  pediatric radiation dose to normal tissues should be reduced as much as possible  because of the effect of radiation on growth, intellectual development,  endocrine organ function and secondary cancer development. Hepatocellular  carcinoma is common in Asia, and most of the studies of proton beam therapy for  liver cancer have been reported by Japanese investigators. Proton beam therapy  is also a standard treatment for nasal and paranasal lesions and lesions at the  base of the skull, because the radiation dose to critical organs such as the  eyes, optic nerves and central nervous system can be reduced with proton beam  therapy. For prostate cancer, comparative studies that address adverse effects,  safety, patient quality of life and socioeconomic issues should be performed to  determine the appropriate use of proton beam therapy for prostate cancer.  Regarding new proton beam therapy applications, experience with proton beam  therapy combined with chemotherapy is limited, although favorable outcomes have  been recently reported for locally advanced lung cancer, esophageal cancer and  pancreatic cancer. Therefore, 'chemoproton' therapy appears to be a very  attractive field for further clinical investigations. In conclusion, there are  cost issues and considerations regarding national insurance for the use of  proton beam therapy in Japan. Further studies and discussions are needed to  address the use of proton beam therapy for several types of cancers, and for  maintaining the quality of life of patients while retaining a high cure rate.""]","Yes, proton beam therapy is used for treatment of medulloblastoma."
83,Is cystatin C or cystatin 3 used as a biomarker of kidney function?,"['AIM: To study an association between clinical and morphological evidence and the  serum and daily urinary levels of cystatin C (CysC) and neutrophil  gelatinase-associated lipocalin (NGAL) in patients with primary  glomerulopathies. SUBJECTS AND METHODS: The investigation included 104 patients; morphological  examination showed minimal change disease in 15 (14.4%) patients, focal  segmental glomerulosclerosis in 24 (23.1%), membrane nephropathy in 32 (30.8%),  and IgA nephropathy (mesangioproliferative glomerulonephritis) in 33 (31.7%).  The investigators analyzed the clinical type of nephropathy, performed  conventional laboratory and instrumental examinations, and determined the level  of CysC (by immunoturbodimetry) and NGAL (by enzyme immunoassay) in the serum  and daily urine taken before kidney biopsy. The degree of glomerulosclerosis,  tubulointerstititial sclerosis, and tubular atrophy was semiquantitatively  estimated. RESULTS: Urinary CysC and NGAL excretion correlated with the degree of  glomerulosclerosis and proteinuria and the reduced glomerular filtration rate  (GFR) regardless of the method of its determination. The urinary level of NGAL  positively correlated with the degree of tubular atrophy. The GFR value  determined from serum CysC and creatinine levels more precisely reflected the  degree of glomerulosclerosis. CONCLUSION: The tubulointerstitial compartment in primary glomerulopathies  should be determined not only by morphological changes, but also by tubular  function parameters by estimating the urinary excretion of biomarkers. The  urinary content of CysC reflects tubular epithelial dysfunction whereas that of  NGAL also characterizes tubular atrophy. To estimate the degree of  glomerulosclerosis, it is more preferable to use the GFR calculated from the  blood concentrations of CysC and creatinine, by keeping in mind clinical  findings (using Chronic Kidney Disease Epidemiology Collaboration formula,  2012).', ""PURPOSE OF REVIEW: The aim is to examine a dominant narrative in nephrology over  the past decade: that measured glomerular filtration rate (GFR) is the gold  standard measure of kidney function; accurate assessment of GFR is critical and  paramount; and further efforts to refine GFR estimation should continue. RECENT FINDINGS: Studies that have simultaneously compared measured GFR and  estimated GFR (using endogenous filtration markers such as creatinine, or newer  ones such as cystatin C or β-trace protein) against some external metric of  kidney function have failed to show that measured GFR is consistently superior,  which is what one would expect if measured GFR were truly the 'gold standard.' SUMMARY: Compared with estimated GFR, measured GFR does not consistently predict  renal-related outcomes better. Clinical decision-making almost never requires  precise and accurate knowledge of a patient's static GFR value. Efforts at  perfecting cross-sectional estimates of GFR may have reached a point of  diminishing returns."", 'BACKGROUND/AIMS: Several formulas for glomerular filtration rate (GFR)  estimation, based on serum creatinine or cystatin C, have been proposed. We  assessed the impact of some of these equations on estimated GFR (eGFR) and  chronic kidney disease (CKD) prevalence, and on the association with  cardiovascular risk factors, in a general population sample characterized by a  young mean age. METHODS: We studied 1,199 individuals from three Alpine villages enrolled into  the MICROS study. eGFR was obtained with the 4- and 6-parameter MDRD study  equations, the Virga equation, and with the three CKD-EPI formulas for  creatinine, cystatin C, and the combination of creatinine and cystatin C. We  assessed the concordance between quantitative eGFR levels, CKD prevalence, and  in terms of association with total, LDL, and HDL cholesterol. RESULTS: The highest and lowest eGFR levels corresponded to the cystatin C-based  and MDRD-4 equations, respectively. CKD prevalence varied from 1.8% (Virga) to  5.8% (MDRD-4). The CKD-EPI based on creatinine showed the highest agreement with  all other equations. Agreement between methods was higher at lower eGFR levels,  older age, and in the presence of diabetes and hypertension. Creatinine-based  estimates of eGFR were associated with total and low-density lipoprotein but not  high-density lipoprotein cholesterol. The opposite was observed for the cystatin  C-based GFR. CONCLUSION: GFR estimation is strongly affected by the chosen equation.  Differences are more pronounced in healthy and younger individuals. To identify  CKD risk factors, the choice of the equation is of secondary importance to the  choice of the biomarker used in the formula. If eGFR is not calibrated to a gold  standard GFR in the general population, reports about CKD prevalence should be  considered with caution.', 'AIM: Chronic kidney disease (CKD) is a known risk factor for cardiovascular  disease (CVD). Cystatin C was recently reported to be an endogenous surrogate of  kidney function, and a high level of cystatin C is reported to be a strong  predictor of CVD; however, the association between cystatin C and  arteriosclerosis in a non-CKD population is unclear. This study aimed to clarify  the association between cystatin C and arteriosclerosis in a non-CKD population. METHODS: Of the 637 Japanese adults (264 men, 373 women) enrolled, we analyzed  446 participants with an estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR) >60 mL/min  and no proteinuria (177 men, 269 women) without a history of CVD. Kidney  function was evaluated according to serum cystatin C levels and eGFR.  Arteriosclerosis was evaluated on the basis of the cardio-ankle vascular index  (CAVI) and carotid intima-media thickness (CIMT). RESULTS: The mean age of our subjects was 67.0±10.0 years. No variables showed  any significant differences according to gender. The results of multiple linear  regression analysis showed a significant correlation between serum cystatin C  and CAVI only in women, but not CIMT. CONCLUSION: We observed a significant correlation between cystatin C and CAVI,  which is a marker of early-stage arteriosclerosis, in women in a non-CKD  population with no proteinuria and eGFR>60 mL/min.', 'Whether kidney dysfunction is associated with coronary artery calcium (CAC) in  young and middle-aged adults who have a cystatin C-derived estimated glomerular  filtration rate (eGFRcys) greater than 60 mL/min/1.73 m(2) is unknown. In the  Coronary Artery Risk Development in Young Adults (CARDIA) cohort (recruited in  1985 and 1986 in Birmingham, Alabama; Chicago, Illinois; Minneapolis, Minnesota;  and Oakland, California), we examined 1) the association of eGFRcys at years 10  and 15 and detectable CAC over the subsequent 5 years and 2) the association of  change in eGFRcys and subsequent CAC, comparing those with stable eGFRcys to  those whose eGFRcys increased (>3% annually over 5 years), declined moderately  (3%-5%), or declined rapidly (>5%). Generalized estimating equation Poisson  models were used, with adjustment for age, sex, race, educational level, income,  family history of coronary artery disease, diabetes, body mass index,  low-density lipoprotein cholesterol, high-density lipoprotein cholesterol, and  tobacco use. Among 3,070 participants (mean age 35.6 (standard deviation, 4.1)  years and mean eGFRcys 106.7 (standard deviation, 18.5) mL/min/1.73 m(2)), 529  had detectable CAC. Baseline eGFRcys was not associated with CAC. Moderate  eGFRcys decline was associated with a 33% greater relative risk of subsequent  CAC (95% confidence interval: 5, 68; P = 0.02), whereas rapid decline was  associated with a 51% higher relative risk (95% confidence interval: 10, 208; P  = 0.01) in adjusted models. In conclusion, among young and middle-aged adults  with eGFRcys greater than 60 mL/min/1.73 m(2), annual decline in eGFRcys is an  independent risk factor for subsequent CAC.', 'Routinely, kidney dysfunction and decreased glomerular filtration rate (GFR) are  diagnosed by the evaluation of changes in the serum creatinine (SCr) and blood  urea nitrogen (BUN) concentrations. However, neither of these tests is sensitive  or specific enough for the early diagnosis of impaired kidney function because  they are both affected by other renal and nonrenal factors. Furthermore, kidney  injury can be present in the absence of kidney dysfunction. Renal reserve  enables normal GFR even when nephrons are damaged. Renal biomarkers, especially  those present in urine, may be useful for the study of both acute and chronic  nephropathies. The aim of this review is to describe the current status of  urinary biomarkers as diagnostic tools for kidney injury in dogs with particular  focus on acute kidney injury (AKI). The International Renal Interest Society  (IRIS) canine AKI grading system and the implementation of urinary biomarkers in  this system also are discussed. The discovery of novel urinary biomarkers has  emerged from hypotheses about the pathophysiology of kidney injury, but few  proteomic urine screening approaches have been described in dogs. Lack of  standardization of biomarker assays further complicates the comparison of novel  canine urinary biomarker validation results among studies. Future research  should focus on novel biomarkers of renal origin and evaluate promising  biomarkers in different clinical conditions. Validation of selected urinary  biomarkers in the diagnosis of canine kidney diseases must include dogs with  both renal and nonrenal diseases to evaluate their sensitivity, specificity as  well as their negative and positive predictive values.', 'AIM: To study an association between clinical and morphological evidence and the  serum and daily urinary levels of cystatin C (CysC) and neutrophil  gelatinase-associated lipocalin (NGAL) in patients with primary  glomerulopathies.

Here, we assessed the performance of urine neutrophil gelatinase-associated  lipocalin (NGAL) for outcome prediction in a diverse cohort of 3386 patients  with CKD in the Chronic Renal Insufficiency Cohort study. In this cohort, the  baseline mean estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR) was 42.4 ml/min per  1.73 m(2), the median 24-h urine protein was 0.2 g/day, and the median urine  NGAL concentration was 17.2 ng/ml. Over an average follow-up of 3.2 years, there  were 689 cases in which the eGFR was decreased by half or incident end-stage  renal disease developed. Even after accounting for eGFR, proteinuria, and other  known CKD progression risk factors, urine NGAL remained a significant  independent risk factor (Cox model hazard ratio 1.70 highest to lowest  quartile). The association between baseline urine NGAL levels and risk of CKD  progression was strongest in the first 2 years of biomarker measurement. Within  this time frame, adding urine NGAL to a model that included eGFR, proteinuria,  and other CKD progression risk factors led to net reclassification improvement  of 24.7%, but the C-statistic remained nearly identical. Thus, while urine NGAL  was an independent risk factor of progression among patients with established  CKD of diverse etiology, it did not substantially improve prediction of outcome  events.', 'AIM: To evaluate the Chronic Kidney Disease Epidemiology Collaboration (CKD-EPI)  four-level race equation in the assessment of glomerular filtration rate (GFR)  in Chinese people with chronic kidney disease (CKD), which was published in  2011, compared with the cystatin C-based GFR estimation equation (CysC GFR) and  the combination of CysC and serum creatinine equation (CysC-Scr GFR). METHODS: The CKD-EPI four-level race equation estimated GFR (CKD-EPI GFR) was  compared with the CysC GFR and CysC-Scr GFR. Three equations were compared with  body surface area (BSA) standardized GFR (sGFR), which was measured by (99m)  Tc-DTPA renal dynamic imaging method in 111 CKD cases. RESULTS: A statistically significant correlation was found between sGFR and  CKD-EPI GFR, CysC GFR and CysC-Scr GFR. Three estimated GFR (eGFR) equations of  30% accuracy were 58.6%, 56.8% and 63.5%, respectively. Average deviations of  eGFR from sGFR were 2.34, 1.19, and 1.32 (mL/min per 1.73 m(2)) (P > 0.05),  respectively. There was no significant deviation in the CKD from stages 1 to 5  in CKD-EPI GFR and CysC-Scr GFR. However, when estimated by CysC GFR, the  deviation was increased, with the value of 12.41 mL/min per 1.73 m(2) (P= 0.002)  in CKD stage 5. CONCLUSION: Our results showed that in a Chinese population with CKD, CKD-EPI  GFR, CysC GFR and CysC-Scr GFR of bias and overall accuracy of 30% were very  similar. There was little advantage in adding Asian coefficient to modifying the  CKD-EPI equation. CysC GFR overestimated GFR in patients with CKD stages 4 and  5.', 'A growing number of patients are recognised to have chronic kidney disease  (CKD). However, only a minority will progress to end-stage renal disease  requiring dialysis or transplantation. Currently available diagnostic and  staging tools frequently fail to identify those at higher risk of progression or  death. Furthermore within specific disease entities there are shortcomings in  the prediction of the need for therapeutic interventions or the response to  different forms of therapy. Kidney and urine proteomic biomarkers are considered  as promising diagnostic tools to predict CKD progression early in diabetic  nephropathy, facilitating timely and selective intervention that may reduce the  related health-care expenditures. However, independent groups have not validated  these findings and the technique is not currently available for routine clinical  care. Furthermore, there are gaps in our understanding of predictors of  progression or need for therapy in non-diabetic CKD. Presumably, a combination  of tissue and urine biomarkers will be more informative than individual markers.  This review identifies clinical questions in need of an answer, summarises  current information on proteomic biomarkers and CKD, and describes the European  Kidney and Urine Proteomics initiative that has been launched to carry out a  clinical study aimed at identifying urinary proteomic biomarkers distinguishing  between fast and slow progressors among patients with biopsy-proven primary  glomerulopathies.']","Yes, cystatin C (CysC) is a  novel biomarker of renal function."
84,Which two interleukins are inhibited by Ustekinumab?,"[""INTRODUCTION: Ustekinumab is a human monoclonal antibody directed against the  shared p40 subunit of interleukins 12 and 23. Ustekinumab is currently approved  for the treatment of psoriatic arthritis (PsA) and moderate to severe plaque  psoriasis, and is being evaluated in Crohn's disease (CD). AREAS COVERED: The first evidence supporting the efficacy of ustekinumab in the  treatment of moderate to severe CD was published in 2008. Results from  subsequent phase II and phase III randomized controlled trials (RCTs) have shown  promising data on the clinical efficacy of induction and remission of moderate  to severe CD. These data and the safety profile of ustekinumab will be reviewed.  Expert commentary: As a significant proportion of individuals with CD have  ongoing symptoms and inflammation despite existing therapies, there is a  clinical need for new agents like ustekinumab directed at different targets on  the inflammatory pathway. Looking forward, more studies are needed to evaluate  dosing escalation or de-escalation in addition to timing of therapy switches. In  addition, further data is required to gauge the comparative effectiveness of  ustekinumab to the biologic agents that are currently used in the treatment of  CD."", ""Pyoderma gangrenosum (PG) is an orphan disease. While research on such disorders  is based on only few randomized multicenter as well as retrospective studies,  most of the data comes from case series of small patient groups. Apart from  topical and intralesional therapeutic options for early stages and mild disease  courses, treatment predominantly involves systemic therapeutic agents. Besides  systemic corticosteroids and cyclosporine A (CsA), options also include  intravenous immunoglobulins (IVIG) and biologics such as the TNFα inhibitors  infliximab, adalimumab, and etanercept; the interleukin (IL) 12/23 antibody  ustekinumab; the IL-1 receptor antagonist anakinra; and the IL-1β antibody  canakinumab. The best evidence-based study data is available for CsA,  prednisolone, and infliximab; the latter especially in patients with concomitant  ulcerative colitis or Crohn's disease. A response to IVIG and canakinumab has  been reported in smaller case series. First described by Brocq almost 100 years  ago, it was soon recognized that PG did in fact require treatment. To this day,  however, such treatment remains a clinical challenge. Despite the severe -  albeit rare -clinical picture, improvement in therapeutic options may be  expected in the future, primarily due to further clinical studies - especially  with a greater number of patients, a better understanding of the  etiopathogenesis, as well as the use of modern targeted therapies with higher  efficacy and a lower rate of side effects than conventional immunosuppressants  such as prednisolone and CsA."", 'BACKGROUND: Interleukin-23 is thought to be critical to the pathogenesis of  psoriasis. We compared risankizumab (BI 655066), a humanized IgG1 monoclonal  antibody that inhibits interleukin-23 by specifically targeting the p19 subunit  and thus prevents interleukin-23 signaling, and ustekinumab, an interleukin-12  and interleukin-23 inhibitor, in patients with moderate-to-severe plaque  psoriasis. METHODS: We randomly assigned a total of 166 patients to receive subcutaneous  injections of risankizumab (a single 18-mg dose at week 0 or 90-mg or 180-mg  doses at weeks 0, 4, and 16) or ustekinumab (45 or 90 mg, according to body  weight, at weeks 0, 4, and 16). The primary end point was a 90% or greater  reduction from baseline in the Psoriasis Area and Severity Index (PASI) score at  week 12. RESULTS: At week 12, the percentage of patients with a 90% or greater reduction  in the PASI score was 77% (64 of 83 patients) for risankizumab (90-mg and 180-mg  groups, pooled), as compared with 40% (16 of 40 patients) for ustekinumab  (P<0.001); the percentage of patients with a 100% reduction in the PASI score  was 45% in the pooled 90-mg and 180-mg risankizumab groups, as compared with 18%  in the ustekinumab group. Efficacy was generally maintained up to 20 weeks after  the final dose of 90 or 180 mg of risankizumab. In the 18-mg and 90-mg  risankizumab groups and the ustekinumab group, 5 patients (12%), 6 patients  (15%), and 3 patients (8%), respectively, had serious adverse events, including  two basal-cell carcinomas and one major cardiovascular adverse event; there were  no serious adverse events in the 180-mg risankizumab group.

A recent Italian study showed more favourable response  to ustekinumab in patients with positive human leucocyte antigen (HLA)-Cw6.  Nonetheless, there are differences in genetic susceptibility to psoriasis  between races, and no studies have specifically assessed the candidate genetic  markers in predicting therapy outcome in Chinese patients with psoriasis treated  with ustekinumab. OBJECTIVES: To determine whether HLA gene polymorphisms can predict the response  to ustekinumab in Chinese patients with psoriasis. METHODS: Sixty-six patients with psoriasis treated with ustekinumab were  included in the study, and the effectiveness of ustekinumab therapy was  evaluated at weeks 0, 16 and 28 by Psoriasis Area and Severity Index (PASI). RESULTS: More HLA-Cw6-positive patients achieved a PASI 75 response at week 4  compared with HLA-Cw6-negative patients (38% vs. 9%, P\xa0=\xa00·019). Similarly, at  week 16, patients carrying the HLA-Cw6 allele showed a higher likelihood of  achieving PASI 50, 75 and 90 than Cw6-negative patients, although this was not  statistically significant. At week 28, a significantly higher percentage of  HLA-Cw6-positive patients maintained PASI 90 response compared with Cw6-negative  patients (63% vs. 26%, P\xa0=\xa00·035). Further analysis of other HLA allele  polymorphisms did not show significant associations with therapeutic response to  ustekinumab.

We compared two biologic agents, ustekinumab (an  interleukin-12 and interleukin-23 blocker) and etanercept (an inhibitor of tumor  necrosis factor alpha), for the treatment of psoriasis. METHODS: We randomly assigned 903 patients with moderate-to-severe psoriasis to  receive subcutaneous injections of either 45 or 90 mg of ustekinumab (at weeks 0  and 4) or high-dose etanercept (50 mg twice weekly for 12 weeks). The primary  end point was the proportion of patients with at least 75% improvement in the  psoriasis area-and-severity index (PASI) at week 12; a secondary end point was  the proportion with cleared or minimal disease on the basis of the physician's  global assessment. Assessors were unaware of the treatment assignments. The  efficacy and safety of a crossover from etanercept to ustekinumab were evaluated  after week 12. RESULTS: There was at least 75% improvement in the PASI at week 12 in 67.5% of  patients who received 45 mg of ustekinumab and 73.8% of patients who received 90  mg, as compared with 56.8% of those who received etanercept (P=0.01 and P<0.001,  respectively). Similarly, 65.1% of patients who received 45 mg of ustekinumab  and 70.6% of patients who received 90 mg of ustekinumab had cleared or minimal  disease according to the physician's global assessment, as compared with 49.0%  of those who received etanercept (P<0.001 for both comparisons). Among patients  who did not have a response to etanercept, 48.9% had at least 75% improvement in  the PASI within 12 weeks after crossover to ustekinumab. One or more adverse  events occurred through week 12 in 66.0% of patients who received 45 mg of  ustekinumab and 69.2% of patients who received 90 mg of ustekinumab and in 70.0%  who received etanercept; 1.9%, 1.2%, and 1.2%, respectively, had serious adverse  events. Safety patterns were similar before and after crossover from etanercept  to ustekinumab. CONCLUSIONS: The efficacy of ustekinumab at a dose of 45 or 90 mg was superior  to that of high-dose etanercept over a 12-week period in patients with  psoriasis.

However, the high  incidence of immune response against the mouse mAb restricted therapeutic  utility. Development of chimeric, ""humanized"" and human mAbs broadened  therapeutic application to immune-mediated diseases requiring long-term  treatment. Indeed, mAb therapeutics targeting soluble cytokines are highly  effective in numerous immune-mediated disorders. A recent example is  ustekinumab, a first-in-class therapeutic human immunoglobulin G1 kappa mAb that  binds to the interleukins (IL)-12 and IL-23, cytokines that modulate lymphocyte  function, including T-helper (Th) 1 and Th17 cell subsets. Ustekinumab was  generated via recombinant human IL-12 immunization of human immunoglobulin  (hu-Ig) transgenic mice. Ustekinumab binds to the p40 subunit common to IL-12  and IL-23 and prevents their interaction with the IL-12 receptor β1 subunit of  the IL-12 and IL-23 receptor complexes. Ustekinumab is approved for treatment of  moderate-to-severe plaque psoriasis and has demonstrated efficacy in Crohn  disease and psoriatic arthritis.

Patients underwent corticosteroid tapering between weeks 16 and 28. The primary  end-point was week 16 change in percentage predicted forced vital capacity (ΔFVC  % pred) in the lung group. Major secondary end-points were: week 28 for ΔFVC %  pred, 6-min walking distance, St George's Respiratory Questionnaire (lung  group), and Skin Physician Global Assessment response (skin group). At week 16,  no significant differences were observed in ΔFVC % pred with ustekinumab (-0.15,  p = 0.13) or golimumab (1.15, p = 0.54) compared with placebo (2.02). At week  28, there were no significant improvements in the major secondary end-points,  although a nonsignificant numerically greater Skin Physician Global Assessment  response was observed following golimumab treatment (53%) when compared with the  placebo (30%). Serious adverse events were similar in all treatment groups.  Although treatment was well tolerated, neither ustekinumab nor golimumab  demonstrated efficacy in pulmonary sarcoidosis. However, trends towards  improvement were observed with golimumab in some dermatological end-points."", 'Ustekinumab, a human immunoglobulin G1 kappa (IgG1k) monoclonal antibody that  binds with high affinity to human interleukin-12 and interleukin-23, has  demonstrated efficacy in patients with psoriasis. The objective of this study  was to perform exposure-response modeling to increase the understanding of  reduction in disease severity following treatment with ustekinumab in patients  with moderate to severe psoriasis who participate in two phase III studies  (PHOENIX 1 and PHOENIX 2). Patients were randomly assigned to receive  ustekinumab 45 mg or 90 mg (n = 1312; 11,624 Psoriasis Area and Severity Index  [PASI] scores) or placebo (n = 665; 3278 PASI scores). Disease severity was  assessed using PASI scores. A population mechanism-based exposure-response model  of ustekinumab using NONMEM was developed using serum ustekinumab concentrations  and PASI scores. The pharmacodynamic response effect was the reduction in PASI  score. The placebo effect, although minor, was also integrated into the model.  None of the covariate factors evaluated (eg, demographics, baseline disease  characteristics, comorbidities) significantly contributed to the between-subject  variability in the pharmacodynamic parameters. The developed exposure-response  model can serve as a basis to support future alternative dosing regimens for  ustekinumab in patients with moderate to severe plaque psoriasis. A robust  exposure-response relationship has been confirmed for ustekinumab in psoriasis.', 'The recognition of the roles of interleukins (IL)-12 and IL-23 in the  development of psoriasis is an important advance in the understanding, and the  subsequent management, of this chronic inflammatory disease. Two human anti-p40  monoclonal antibodies targeting both IL-12 and IL-23 via their shared p40  subunit have been developed: briakinumab and ustekinumab. Recent Phase 2 and  Phase 3 trials have illustrated the benefits of briakinumab (in Phase 3 clinical  development) and ustekinumab (approved in the EU, and also in other territories  worldwide) in the treatment of moderate to severe plaque psoriasis. Available  data indicate that a strategy targeting the IL-12 p40 subunit has considerable  advantages over targeting of tumour necrosis factor-α, offering rapid onset of  efficacy with a favourable dosing regimen (every 12 weeks for ustekinumab).

Previous studies  have reported that 3.3 to 13.3 per cent of fetuses with echogenic bowel  discovered during the second trimester were affected with CF. Between 1994 and  1998 our laboratory tested 159 cases with echogenic bowel detected during a  routine ultrasound examination. The ethnic/racial background of cases included  Caucasian, African-American, Middle Eastern, Hispanic, Ashkenazi Jewish and  Asian. We identified two CF fetuses (1.3 per cent) and eight fetuses with a  single identifiable CF mutation (5 per cent) within this diverse population.  These data indicated that the risk of CF in a fetus with echogenic bowel in this  population was less than the 3.3 to 13.3 per cent prior risk currently used in  most Bayesian calculations. Furthermore, the results suggested that specific  risks for couples should be calculated using data specific for their ethnic or  racial background. Based on our results, we recommend either amniocentesis for  fetal CF studies or CF carrier screening of both parents when fetal echogenic  bowel is detected as a 1.3 per cent risk of CF is considered high enough to  warrant further testing.', 'OBJECTIVE: Pregnancies medical follow-up and ultrasonography development have  enabled detection of fetal echogenic bowel, a sign associated with various  pathologies, including cystic fibrosis. Based on the long experience of a region  where cystic fibrosis is frequent (Brittany, France), we describe disorders  diagnosed in fetal echogenic bowel fetuses and assess ultrasonography ability in  detecting cystic fibrosis in utero. STUDY DESIGN: We reviewed the cases of fetal echogenic bowel diagnosed in  pregnant women living in Brittany and referred for CFTR gene analysis over the  1992-2007 period (n = 289). RESULTS: A disorder was diagnosed in 32.2% of the fetuses, cystic fibrosis being  the most commonly identified (7.6%). We also found digestive malformations  (7.0%), chromosomal abnormalities (3.7%), and maternofetal infections (3.7%).  Combining these data with our ongoing newborn screening program since 1989  showed that ultrasonography enabled diagnosis of 10.7% of the cystic fibrosis  cases. CONCLUSION: This study highlights the importance of pregnancy ultrasound  examinations and their efficiency in detecting cystic fibrosis.', 'Analysis of CFTR mutation screening in cases of isolated fetal echogenic bowel  in the South Australian population.', 'OBJECTIVE: To investigate the association between fetal echogenic bowel (FEB)  during the second trimester and perinatal outcome. METHODS: A retrospective chart review of FEB during the second trimester over 3  years. RESULTS: A total of 56 women were identified of 9067 screened (0.6%) women.  Forty-seven agreed to genetic counseling (84%). Of those, 22 (39%) agreed to an  amniocentesis. There were three cases of trisomy 21, one case of trisomy 18 and  one case of fetal CMV infection. Twelve fetuses had an adverse outcome (21%),  with only three of them having an echogenic bowel as the only finding. CONCLUSIONS: In our study, almost 80% of the fetuses had an uncomplicated  perinatal outcome. FEB was present as the only finding in only 5% of the fetuses  with an adverse outcome. A potential association with placental abnormalities  and a low prevalence of viral infections was observed. These findings may be of  use in counseling parents.', ""OBJECTIVE: The objective was to evaluate the incidence of gastrointestinal  abnormalities amongst those fetuses with antenatally diagnosed echogenic bowel  (EB). MATERIALS AND METHODS: A retrospective review of all cases delivered from April  2002 to March 2003 with antenatally diagnosed EB was conducted. This was defined  as bowel that appeared as echogenic as (if not greater than) the iliac bone on a  real-time image. The postnatal outcomes with regard to gastrointestinal  abnormalities, till their discharge, were noted. RESULTS: Of the 13,941 patients delivered, there were 70 cases with antenatally  diagnosed EB, giving an incidence of 70/13,941 or 0.50%. Of these, 6 defaulted  follow-up and 1 had a mid-trimester termination of pregnancy at 21 weeks'  gestation for social reasons. Of the remaining 63 cases with EB, 2 were  stillbirths at 31 weeks and 35 weeks of gestation, respectively. Three fetuses  (3/63 or 4.76%) were diagnosed with gastrointestinal abnormalities. Meconium  plug syndrome was diagnosed postnatally in 2 cases, of which, 1 resolved with  conservative management while the other required an emergency laparotomy.  Intestinal atresia was diagnosed in the postmortem of one of the stillbirths.  There was evidence of intrauterine growth retardation (IUGR) in both the  stillbirth and the fetus that had required laparotomy. None of the 3 fetuses  exhibited clinical features of aneuploidy. CONCLUSION: As the quoted background risk for gastrointestinal pathology is  0.23%, an increased incidence (4.76%) is observed in those fetuses found to have  antenatal EB. It is possible that the presence of IUGR is associated with a  worse prognosis. Further prospective studies are needed to verify this  association."", 'BACKGROUND: An increased frequency of hyperechogenic bowel on ultrasound has  been reported in fetuses with cystic fibrosis (CF) and trisomy-21. However, the  diagnostic application of this observation has been hampered by the absence of a  means of measuring echogenicity. METHODS: We devised an ultrasonic grading system in which echogenicity was  quantified by linear gain reduction and comparison with fetal iliac crest. From  7400 second-trimester ultrasound referrals, 145 patients were identified as  having a fetus with abnormally echogenic bowel. They were offered genetic  counselling, parental and (if appropriate) CF carrier testing, and amniocentesis  for karyotype and CF status if parents were informative. Follow-up was to 4  months of age. FINDINGS: Of 40 fetuses with mild increase in bowel sonodensity (grade 1), none  had CF or aneuploidy. Of 81 patients identified with a moderate increase (grade  2), 2 had trisomy 21 and 2 had CF. And of 24 pregnancies with a pronounced  increase (grade 3), 5 had CF and 6 had trisomy-21. INTERPRETATION: Parental CF carrier testing and amniocentesis to identify  aneuploidy or fetal CF status has a high positive ascertainment rate in fetuses  with echogenic bowel grades 2 and 3.', 'OBJECTIVE: Our purpose was to determine whether the presence of heme pigments in  amniotic fluid is associated with the ultrasonographic findings of increased  fetal bowel echogenicity in the second trimester. STUDY DESIGN: Spectrophotometric analysis of amniotic fluid for optical density  at 410 nm was prospectively performed to study the presence of heme pigments in  (1) 104 pregnancies undergoing second-trimester amniocentesis for routine  cytogenetic indications and (2) in 14 pregnancies undergoing amniocentesis for  prenatal karyotyping because of fetal strongly echogenic bowel. In the routine  amniocentesis group the fetal small bowel echogenicity was assessed immediately  before amniocentesis and classified as nonechogenic (n = 64), mildly echogenic  (n = 36), or hyperechogenic (n = 4) with the fetal iliac wing and liver used as  references. Only amniotic fluid specimens that were obtained at the first  attempt and that were not blood-stained were included in this study, with the  first milliliter being discarded in all samples. RESULTS: In the routine amniocentesis group abnormal amniotic fluid optical  density readings were significantly more frequent in fetuses with increased  bowel echogenicity compared with those with nonechogenic bowel (8/40 [20%] vs  3/64 [5%], respectively; p < 0.001). In the hyperchogenic bowel group abnormal  amniotic fluid optical density readings were found in four samples (29%).  Overall, 12 of 54 fetuses (22%) with increased bowel echogenicity had a  detectable peak at 410 nm. Three of the 12 (25%) fetuses with echogenic bowel  and positive readings for hemoglobin were chromosomally abnormal. CONCLUSIONS: Fetal small bowel echogenicity is associated with the presence of  heme pigments in amniotic fluid as determined by amniotic fluid optical density  at 410 nm. Swallowing of amniotic fluid after intraamniotic bleeding seems  implicated in the etiology of second-trimester echogenic bowel in both euploid  and aneuploid fetuses.', 'OBJECTIVE: Fetal echogenic bowel (FEB) is a soft marker found on second  trimester sonography. Our main aim was to determine the outcome of infants who  presented with FEB and secondarily to identify additional sonographic findings  that might have clinical relevance for the prognosis. DESIGN: We reviewed all pregnancies in which the diagnosis FEB was made in our  Fetal Medicine Unit during 2009-2010 (N=121). We divided all cases into five  groups according to additional sonographic findings. Group 1 consisted of cases  of isolated FEB, group 2 of FEB associated with dilated bowels, group 3 of FEB  with one or two other soft markers, group 4 of FEB with major congenital  anomalies or three or more other soft markers, and group 5 consisted of FEB with  isolated intrauterine growth restriction (IUGR). RESULTS: Of 121 cases, five were lost to follow-up. Of the remaining 116 cases,  48 (41.4%) were assigned to group 1, 15 (12.9%) to group 2, 15 (12.9%) to group  3, 27 (23.2%) to group 4, and 11 (9.5%) to group 5. The outcome for group 1 was  uneventful. In group 2 and 3, two anomalies, anorectal malformation and cystic  fibrosis, were detected postnatally (6.7%). In group 4, mortality and morbidity  were high (78% resp. 22%). Group 5 also had high mortality (82%) and major  morbidity (18%). CONCLUSIONS: If FEB occurs in isolation, it is a benign condition carrying a  favourable prognosis. If multiple additional anomalies or early IUGR are  observed, the prognosis tends to be less favourable to extremely poor.']","Fetal echogenic bowel is mainly associated to feto-maternal, intramniotic bleeding but in several cases it is linked to cystic fibrosis, cytomegalovirus (CMV), herpes simplex virus and other viral infections and fetal aneuploidy."
86,What is the prognostic role of thyroid hormone in patients with heart failure?,"['BACKGROUND: It has been suggested that low thyroid hormones levels may be  associated with increased mortality in patients with cardiovascular disease. AIM: To evaluate the prognostic role of thyroid function deficiency in patients  with chronic heart failure (CHF). METHODS: We evaluated 338 consecutive outpatients with stable CHF receiving  conventional therapy, all of whom underwent a physical examination,  electrocardiography and echocardiography. Blood samples were drawn to assess  renal function, and Na+, hemoglobin, NT-proBNPs, fT3, fT4 and TSH levels.  Patients with hyperthyroidism were excluded. RESULTS: During the follow-up (15+/-8 months), heart failure progression was  observed in 79 patients (including 18 who died of heart failure after  hospitalisation and six who underwent transplantation). Univariate regression  analysis showed that TSH (p<0.0001), fT3 (p<0.0001), fT4 (p=0.016) and fT3/fT4  (p<0.0001) were associated with heart failure progression but multivariate  analysis showed that only TSH considered as a continuous variable (p = 0.001) as  well as subclinical hypothyroidism (TSH &gt 5.5 mUI/l; p=0.014) remained  significantly associated with the events. CONCLUSIONS: In CHF patients TSH levels even slightly above normal range are  independently associated with a greater likelihood of heart failure progression.  This supports the need for prospective studies aimed at clarifying the most  appropriate therapeutic approach to sub-clinical hypothyroidism in such  patients.', 'Although low levels of free triiodothyronine and high levels of brain  natriuretic peptide have been shown as independent predictors of death in  chronic heart failure patients, few studies have compared their prognostic  values. The aim of this prospective study was to measure free triiodothyronine  and brain natriuretic peptide levels and to compare their prognostic values  among such patients.A total of 334 patients (mean age, 62 ± 13 yr; 218 men) with  ischemic and nonischemic dilated cardiomyopathy were included in the study. The  primary endpoint was a major cardiac event.During the follow-up period, 92  patients (28%) experienced a major cardiac event. Mean free triiodothyronine  levels were lower and median brain natriuretic peptide levels were higher in  patients with major cardiac events than in those without. A significant negative  correlation was found between free triiodothyronine and brain natriuretic  peptide levels. Receiver operating characteristic curve analysis showed that the  predictive cutoff values were < 2.12 pg/mL for free triiodothyronine and > 686  pg/mL for brain natriuretic peptide. Cumulative survival was significantly lower  among patients with free triiodothyronine < 2.12 pg/mL and among patients with  brain natriuretic peptide > 686 pg/mL. In multivariate analysis, the significant  independent predictors of major cardiac events were age, free triiodothyronine,  and brain natriuretic peptide.In the present study, free triiodothyronine and  brain natriuretic peptide had similar prognostic values for predicting long-term  prognosis in chronic heart failure patients. These results also suggested that  combining these biomarkers may provide an important risk indicator for patients  with heart failure.', 'In this study the authors sought to determine the prevalence and long-term  prognostic value of low triiodothyronine levels in elderly patients with heart  failure and no thyroid disease. Lower levels of triiodothyronine are more  prevalent in patients with advanced heart failure without thyroid disease, and  this may have prognostic implications. However, this hormonal milieu has not  been investigated in elderly patients. The authors prospectively followed a  consecutive sample of 69 elderly patients aged 76.5+/-5.9 years with heart  failure and 44 age-matched controls without heart failure between March 1997 and  September 2000 at the Geriatric Cardiology Outpatient Clinic of the Heart  Institute of Sao Paulo, Brazil. Events analyzed included death, hospitalization,  and the combined end point of death or hospitalization. The study revealed that  levels of triiodothyronine were lower in heart failure patients than in controls  (89+/-23 vs. 101+/-16 ng/dL, p=0.001). During the follow-up period of 14.3+/-8.1  months there were 19 deaths and 33 hospitalizations in the heart failure group.  The combined end point of death or hospitalization occurred in 38 patients.  Triiodothyronine levels were lower in heart failure patients who had a  cardiovascular event than in event-free patients (82.7+/-24.8 vs. 96.7+/-19.2  ng/dL, p=0.012). The odds ratio for events was 9.8 (95% confidence interval,  2.2-43, p=0.004) for patients in the lowest tertile of triiodothyronine, that  is, lower than 80 ng/dL, compared with patients with levels above 80 ng/dL. The  authors conclude that among elderly patients with heart failure, lower  triiodothyronine concentrations are more prevalent and are associated with a  worse prognosis.', 'OBJECTIVE: Previous experimental studies have provided evidence showing that  changes in thyroid hormone signaling correspond to alterations in myocardial  function in animal models of heart failure. The present study further explores  whether thyroid hormone alterations are correlated with the functional status of  the myocardium in patients with heart failure. METHODS: In this study, 37 patients with mean ejection fraction (EF%) of 26.2  (8.2) were included. Myocardial performance was assessed by echocardiography and  cardiopulmonary exercise testing. Total tri-iodothyronine (T3), thyroxine, and  TSH levels were measured in plasma. RESULTS: Total T3 was strongly correlated with VO2max (r = 0.78, P = 2 x  10(-8)). Furthermore, multivariate analysis revealed that total T3 was an  independent predictor of VO2max (P = 0.000 005). A weaker but significant  correlation was also found between total T3 and EF% (r = 0.56, P = 0.0004),  systolic (r = 0.43, P = 0.009) and diastolic (r = 0.46, P = 0.004) blood  pressure. CONCLUSIONS: changes in thyroid hormone were closely correlated to myocardial  functional status in patients with heart failure. These data probably indicate a  possible role of thyroid hormone in the pathophysiology of heart failure and  confirm previous experimental reports.', 'To understand the pathophysiology of thyroid heart disease, it is necessary to  recognize that thyroid hormone has effects on both the peripheral circulation  and the myocardium. One of the earliest responses to thyroid hormone  administration is a decline in systemic vascular resistance and an increase in  cardiac output and cardiac contractility. In many ways, this response is similar  to the cardiovascular response to exercise and is associated with increased left  ventricular work. The majority of cardiac adaptations to changes in thyroid  function are physiologic; however, certain patients do demonstrate clinical  evidence of cardiac disease. Atrial arrhythmias, limitations in exercise  tolerance, and congestive heart failure are reported to occur as a result of  hyperthyroidism and are more common in older patients. Thyroid hormone also  plays an important role in the regulation of blood pressure. Diastolic  hypertension is a common accompaniment of hypothyroidism. By understanding the  mechanisms by which thyroid hormone affects both the peripheral circulation as  well as the myocardium, it is possible to predict the clinical response to the  treatment of various thyroid disease states.', 'BACKGROUND: Clinical and experimental data have suggested a potential negative  impact of low-T3 state on the prognosis of cardiac diseases. The aim of the  present prospective study was to assess the role of thyroid hormones in the  prognosis of patient population with heart disease. METHODS AND RESULTS: A total of 573 consecutive cardiac patients underwent  thyroid function profile evaluation. They were divided in two subgroups: group  I, 173 patients with low T3, ie, with free T3 (fT3) <3.1 pmol/L, and group II,  400 patients with normal fT3 (>or=3.1 pmol/L). We considered cumulative and  cardiac death events. During the 1-year follow-up, there were 25 cumulative  deaths in group I and 12 in group II (14.4% versus 3%, P<0.0001); cardiac deaths  were 13 in group I and 6 in group II (7.5% versus 1.5%, P=0.0006). According to  the Cox model, fT3 was the most important predictor of cumulative death (hazard  ratio [HR] 3.582, P<0.0001), followed by dyslipidemia (HR 2.955, P=0.023), age  (HR 1.051, P<0.005), and left ventricular ejection fraction (HR 1.037, P=0.006).  At the logistic multivariate analysis, fT3 was the highest independent predictor  of death (HR 0.395, P=0.003). A prevalence of low fT3 levels was found in  patients with NYHA class III-IV illness compared with patients with NYHA class  I-II (chi(2) 5.65, P=0.019). CONCLUSIONS: Low-T3 syndrome is a strong predictor of death in cardiac patients  and might be directly implicated in the poor prognosis of cardiac patients.', 'Thyroid (dys)function in heart failure: is it a potential target for medical  treatment?', 'Effects of thyroid gland hormones on cardiovascular system have been known for  many years. Thyroid gland hormones deficiency is connected with a range of  metabolic and hemodynamic changes which can contribute to a genesis of heart  failure. Recent works refer to an importance of connection of thyroid gland  hormones metabolism with heart insufficiency pathophysiology. That is especially  a syndrome of a low trijodthyronin level marked as euthyroid sick syndrome which  is significantly more frequent in patients with chronic heart failure compared  to a population of healthy individuals. Recent clinical works proved that  treatment administration of thyroid gland hormones to patients with heart  failure is connected with favourable hemodynamic changes and increased working  capacity if the treatment is well tolerated.', 'Thyroid hormone has multiple effects on the cardiovascular system, ranging from  molecular and cellular effects to the consequent hemodynamic alterations.  Consequently, thyroid function has been evaluated in small cohorts of patients  with advanced heart failure that indicate a significant prevalence of  morphologic or functional thyroid disorders. We sought to determine the  prevalence of altered thyroid hormone metabolism in a broad spectrum of  ambulatory heart failure patients. Thyroid function tests were evaluated in 132  ambulatory patients (98 males, 32 females, mean age, 67 years) with left  ventricular systolic dysfunction (EF < 35%) and New York Heart Association  (NYHA) class I-IV symptoms. Hypothyroidism was defined as serum  thyroid-stimulating hormone (TSH) > 4.25 U/mL and low triiodothyronine (T3)  state was defined as T3 levels < 80 ng/dL, with normal thyroxine (T4) and TSH  level. Seven percent of patients were found to have primary hypothyroidism and  34% have a low T3 state. Of patients receiving amiodarone, 21% had elevated TSH  levels and 76% had low T3 levels. The prevalence of abnormal thyroid function  correlated with NYHA class. There is an unexpectedly high risk of hypothyroidism  and low T3 syndrome in patients regardless of treatment with amiodarone, which  appears to correlate with disease severity that requires further investigation.', 'In heart failure, cardiac output is insufficient to meet the needs of the body  for oxygen delivery. Available data suggest that alterations in thyroid hormone  metabolism may contribute to defective myocardial performance. Accordingly,  thyroid hormone or a thyroid hormone analogue that improves cardiac performance  might be useful in the treatment of heart failure and has been studied.  Experimental and theoretical results of these studies are reviewed and indicate  that thyroid hormone increases cardiac output by a combination of effects on the  heart and peripheral circulation, specifically by increasing myocardial  contractile performance and decreasing venous compliance. In the rat  postinfarction model of heart failure, treatment with low doses of thyroxine  (1.5 micrograms/100 g) for 3 days produced a positive inotropic response,  including an increase in rate of change of left ventricular pressure and a  decrease in left ventricular end-diastolic pressure. These changes could be  attributed to conversion to triiodothyronine, the active intracellular form of  thyroid hormone. When treatment with thyroxine was continued at the same or  higher doses (3 to 15 micrograms/100 g) for 10 to 12 days, heart rate increased  and improvement in left ventricular end-diastolic pressure was not sustained.  More favorable results were obtained with 3,5-diiodothyropropionic acid, a  cardiotonic thyroid hormone analogue administered at doses of 375 microgram/100  g, given in combination with captopril. Thus, triiodothyronine or a thyroid  hormone analogue may be a useful adjunct to other measures in the treatment of  heart failure.']","Altered thyroid profile, particularly sick euthyroid syndrome, is an independent predictor of mortality in patients with chronic heart failure, adding prognostic information to conventional clinical and functional cardiac parameters."
87,Which molecule is inhibited by encorafenib?,"['PURPOSE: To test second-line personalized medicine combination therapies, based  on genomic and proteomic data, in patient-derived xenograft (PDX) models. EXPERIMENTAL DESIGN: We established 12 PDXs from BRAF inhibitor-progressed  melanoma patients. Following expansion, PDXs were analyzed using targeted  sequencing and reverse-phase protein arrays. By using multi-arm preclinical  trial designs, we identified efficacious precision medicine approaches. RESULTS: We identified alterations previously described as drivers of  resistance: NRAS mutations in 3 PDXs, MAP2K1 (MEK1) mutations in 2, BRAF  amplification in 4, and aberrant PTEN in 7. At the protein level, re-activation  of phospho-MAPK predominated, with parallel activation of PI3K in a subset.  Second-line efficacy of the pan-PI3K inhibitor BKM120 with either BRAF  (encorafenib)/MEK (binimetinib) inhibitor combination or the ERK inhibitor  VX-11e was confirmed in vivo Amplification of MET was observed in 3 PDX models,  a higher frequency than expected and a possible novel mechanism of resistance.  Importantly, MET amplification alone did not predict sensitivity to the MET  inhibitor capmatinib. In contrast, capmatinib as single agent resulted in  significant but transient tumor regression in a PDX with resistance to BRAF/MEK  combination therapy and high pMET. The triple combination  capmatinib/encorafenib/binimetinib resulted in complete and sustained tumor  regression in all animals. CONCLUSIONS: Genomic and proteomic data integration identifies dual-core pathway  inhibition as well as MET as combinatorial targets. These studies provide  evidence for biomarker development to appropriately select personalized  therapies of patients and avoid treatment failures. See related commentary by  Hartsough and Aplin, p. 1550.', 'PURPOSE: Dual MAPK pathway inhibition (dMAPKi) with BRAF and MEK inhibitors  improves survival in BRAF V600E/K mutant melanoma, but the efficacy of dMAPKi in  non-V600 BRAF mutant tumors is poorly understood. We sought to characterize the  responsiveness of class II (enhanced kinase activity, dimerization dependent)  BRAF mutant melanoma to dMAPKi. EXPERIMENTAL DESIGN: Tumors from patients with BRAF wild-type (WT), V600E (class  I), and L597S (class II) metastatic melanoma were used to generate  patient-derived xenografts (PDX). We assembled a panel of melanoma cell lines  with class IIa (activation segment) or IIb (p-loop) mutations and compared these  with WT or V600E/K BRAF mutant cells. Cell lines and PDXs were treated with  BRAFi (vemurafenib, dabrafenib, encorafenib, and LY3009120), MEKi (cobimetinib,  trametinib, and binimetinib), or the combination. We identified 2 patients with  BRAF L597S metastatic melanoma who were treated with dMAPKi. RESULTS: BRAFi impaired MAPK signaling and cell growth in class I and II BRAF  mutant cells. dMAPKi was more effective than either single MAPKi at inhibiting  cell growth in all class II BRAF mutant cells tested. dMAPKi caused tumor  regression in two melanoma PDXs with class II BRAF mutations and prolonged  survival of mice with class II BRAF mutant melanoma brain metastases. Two  patients with BRAF L597S mutant melanoma clinically responded to dMAPKi. CONCLUSIONS: Class II BRAF mutant melanoma is growth inhibited by dMAPKi.  Responses to dMAPKi have been observed in 2 patients with class II BRAF mutant  melanoma. These data provide rationale for clinical investigation of dMAPKi in  patients with class II BRAF mutant metastatic melanoma.See related commentary by  Johnson and Dahlman, p. 6107.', 'PURPOSE OF REVIEW: To describe the pharmacological properties, preclinical and  clinical data of the novel V-Raf Murine Sarcoma Viral Oncogene Homolog B  (BRAF)-inhibitor encorafenib (LGX818) and to compare these with established  BRAF-inhibitors in the treatment of locally advanced or metastatic melanoma. RECENT FINDINGS: Encorafenib has shown improved efficacy in the treatment of  metastatic melanoma in comparison with vemurafenib. Combination with the MEK  inhibitor (MEKi) binimetinib allows for higher dose intensities of encorafenib  further improving response rates (RRs). SUMMARY: Combination therapy with BRAF and MEKi has evolved as a standard of  care in the treatment of locally advanced or metastatic BRAF-mutated melanoma.  Despite compelling initial RRs, development of treatment resistance eventually  leads to tumor progression in the majority of BRAF/MEK-inhibitor treated  patients. Moreover, treatment-related adverse events are frequent, resulting in  a substantial proportion of dose modifications and/or treatment  discontinuations. The second-generation BRAF inhibitor encorafenib has been  developed aiming at improved efficacy and tolerability through modifications in  pharmacological properties. Clinical phase 3 data show improved progression-free  survival both for encorafenib monotherapy and combination therapy with  binimetinib compared with vemurafenib. Overall survival data and regulatory  approval of this novel substance are eagerly awaited.', 'Encorafenib (Braftovi™), a BRAF inhibitor, and binimetinib (Mektovi®), a MEK  inhibitor, are two orally bioavailable drugs developed by Array BioPharma. In  June 2018 they each received their first global approval, in the USA, for use in  combination, for patients with unresectable or metastatic melanoma with a  BRAFV600E or -V600K mutation as detected by an FDA-approved test. Registration  applications for encorafenib and binimetinib for use in combination in the  treatment of BRAF-mutation-positive advanced melanoma have also been submitted  in the EU, Australia, Switzerland and Japan, with the EMA Committee for  Medicinal Products for Human Use adopting a positive opinion in July 2018  towards granting the drugs marketing authorizations in the EU. Encorafenib plus  binimetinib combination therapy is also in ongoing phase\xa0III clinical  development in the treatment of metastatic colorectal cancer. This article  summarizes the milestones in the development of encorafenib and binimetinib  leading to these first approvals for the treatment of BRAFV600E or  -V600K-mutation-positive unresectable or metastatic melanoma.', 'Cutaneous toxicities under therapy with selective BRAF inhibitors such as  vemurafenib or encorafenib (LGX818) are frequent, including plantar  hyperkeratosis, squamous cell carcinoma, and second primary melanoma. Pyogenic  granuloma is a benign, rapidly growing, eruptive hemangioma that often bleeds  and ulcerates. Common causes are mechanical trauma and cast immobilization, as  well as multiple drugs such as retinoids and antineoplastic agents. However, the  development of pyogenic granuloma under treatment with encorafenib (LGX818) has  not yet been reported. These three cases might be further examples for  paradoxical activation of the mitogen-activated protein kinase pathway. We  report three male patients with metastatic BRAFV600E-mutated melanoma who  developed pyogenic granulomas 16, 10, and 12 weeks after treatment initiation  with the selective BRAF inhibitors vemurafenib or encorafenib (LGX818). Except  for one patient receiving retinoids, the clinical history for other frequent  causes of pyogenic granuloma was negative. Pyogenic granulomas are not listed in  the drugs investigator brochure but seem to be associated with selective BRAF  inhibitors and might be a cutaneous phenomenon of paradoxical mitogen-activated  protein kinase pathway activation. This correlation has to be confirmed by  further observations.', ""Topoisomerase I inhibitors down-regulate HIF-1α leading to tumor growth  inhibition, but only while maintaining sustained levels of drug exposure.  EZN-2208, a multi-arm 40 kDa pegylated, releasable SN38-drug conjugate, provides  higher, longer lasting exposure of tumors to SN38 in contrast to SN38 that is  released from CPT-11. EZN-2208 also consistently has greater antitumor activity  than CPT-11 in a variety of solid and hematological tumor models. In this  report, the ability of PEG-SN38 to down-regulate HIF-1α and its downstream  targets, in a more potent, sustained manner compared with CPT-11 was examined.  To do so, U251 glioma xenografts that stably expressed a hypoxia response  element-dependent luciferase reporter gene were implanted in mice. After  treatment it was found that EZN-2208 induced potent, sustained HIF-1α  down-regulation (37% at 48 h and 83% at 120 h) in the tumors, whereas CPT-11  caused only minor, transient HIF-1α down-regulation. In addition, EZN-2208  down-regulated mRNA levels of HIF-1α targeted genes (MMP2, VEGF1, Glut1, Glut3  and TGFβ1). Further, western blot analyses of xenograft tumors demonstrated that  EZN-2208 had significantly more effect than CPT-11 in down-regulating HIF-1α,  VEGF, Glut1 and MMP2 protein levels. Significant down-regulation of HIF-1α and  VEGF proteins translated to EZN-2208's superior anti-angiogenic activity  compared with CPT-11, confirmed by microvessel density reduction in a  chorioallantoic membrane assay and in CD-31 immunohistochemistry studies.  Additional studies done with matrigel implants devoid of tumor cells show that  EZN-2208 significantly inhibits angiogenesis while CPT-11 has little or no  effect. It is concluded that the superior antitumor activity of EZN-2208  compared with CPT-11 is attributed, in part, to an anti-angiogenic effect.  Ongoing clinical Phase I and Phase II studies will assess safety and efficacy of  EZN-2208."", 'The inhibitory activity of a broad group of known metalloenzyme inhibitors  against a panel of metalloenzymes was evaluated. Clinically approved inhibitors  were selected as well as several other reported metalloprotein inhibitors in  order to represent a broad range of metal binding groups (MBGs), including  hydroxamic acid, carboxylate, hydroxypyridinonate, thiol, and N-hydroxyurea  functional groups. A panel of metalloenzymes, including carbonic anhydrase  (hCAII), several matrix metalloproteinases (MMPs), angiotensin converting enzyme  (ACE), histone deacetylase (HDAC-2), and tyrosinase (TY), was selected based on  their clinical importance for a range of pathologies. In addition, each  inhibitor was evaluated for its ability to remove Fe(3+) from holo-transferrin  to gauge the ability of the inhibitors to access Fe(3+) from a primary transport  protein. The results show that the metalloenzyme inhibitors are quite selective  for their intended targets, suggesting that despite their ability to bind metal  ions, metalloprotein inhibitors are not prone to widespread off-target enzyme  inhibition activity.', 'RAF kinase is crucially involved in cell proliferation and survival in  colorectal cancer (CRC). Patients with metastatic CRC (mCRC) harboring BRAF  mutations (BRAFms) not only experience a poor prognosis but also benefit less  from therapeutics targeting ERK signaling. With advances in RAF inhibitors and  second-generation inhibitors including encorafenib and vemurafenib, which have  been approved for treating BRAF-V600E malignancies, the combinatorial  therapeutic strategies of RAF inhibitors elicit remarkable responses in patients  with BRAF-V600E mCRC. However, the therapeutic efficacy is restricted by  resistance, which might be due to RAF dimerization and reactivation of the MAPK  pathway. In addition, the next-generation RAF inhibitors, which are  characterized by varying structural and biochemical properties, have achieved  preclinical and clinical advances. Herein, we summarize the existing mechanism  of RAF kinases in CRC, including MAPK feedback reactivation of resistance to RAF  inhibitors. We additionally summarize the development of three generations of  RAF inhibitors and different therapeutic strategies including the combination of  EGFR, BRAF, and PI3K inhibitors for BRAFm CRC treatment.', 'BACKGROUND: Chronic myelogenous leukemia (CML) and Philadelphia  chromosome-positive (Ph+) acute lymphatic leukemia (Ph + ALL) are caused by the  t(9;22), which fuses BCR to ABL resulting in deregulated ABL-tyrosine kinase  activity. The constitutively activated BCR/ABL-kinase ""escapes"" the  auto-inhibition mechanisms of c-ABL, such as allosteric inhibition. The  ABL-kinase inhibitors (AKIs) Imatinib, Nilotinib or Dasatinib, which target the  ATP-binding site, are effective in Ph + leukemia. Another molecular therapy  approach targeting BCR/ABL restores allosteric inhibition. Given the fact that  all AKIs fail to inhibit BCR/ABL harboring the \'gatekeeper\' mutation T315I, we  investigated the effects of AKIs in combination with the allosteric inhibitor  GNF2 in Ph + leukemia. METHODS: The efficacy of this approach on the leukemogenic potential of BCR/ABL  was studied in Ba/F3 cells, primary murine bone marrow cells, and untransformed  Rat-1 fibroblasts expressing BCR/ABL or BCR/ABL-T315I as well as in  patient-derived long-term cultures (PDLTC) from Ph + ALL-patients. RESULTS: Here, we show that GNF-2 increased the effects of AKIs on unmutated  BCR/ABL. Interestingly, the combination of Dasatinib and GNF-2 overcame  resistance of BCR/ABL-T315I in all models used in a synergistic manner. CONCLUSIONS: Our observations establish a new approach for the molecular  targeting of BCR/ABL and its resistant mutants using a combination of AKIs and  allosteric inhibitors.', 'BACKGROUND: Combined BRAF-MEK inhibitor therapy is the standard of care for  BRAFV600-mutant advanced melanoma. We investigated encorafenib, a BRAF inhibitor  with unique target-binding properties, alone or in combination with the MEK  inhibitor binimetinib, versus vemurafenib in patients with advanced  BRAFV600-mutant melanoma. METHODS: COLUMBUS was conducted as a two-part, randomised, open-label phase 3  study at 162 hospitals in 28 countries. Eligible patients were aged 18 years or  older and had histologically confirmed locally advanced (American Joint  Committee on Cancer [AJCC] stage IIIB, IIIC, or IV), unresectable or metastatic  cutaneous melanoma, or unknown primary melanoma; a BRAFV600E or BRAFV600K  mutation; an Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group (ECOG) performance status of 0  or 1; and were treatment naive or had progressed on or after previous first-line  immunotherapy. In part 1 of the study, patients were randomly assigned (1:1:1)  via interactive response technology to receive either oral encorafenib 450 mg  once daily plus oral binimetinib 45 mg twice daily (encorafenib plus binimetinib  group), oral encorafenib 300 mg once daily (encorafenib group), or oral  vemurafenib 960 mg twice daily (vemurafenib group). The primary endpoint was  progression-free survival by blinded independent central review for encorafenib  plus binimetinib versus vemurafenib. Efficacy analyses were by  intention-to-treat. Safety was analysed in patients who received at least one  dose of study drug and one postbaseline safety assessment. The results of part 2  will be published separately. This study is registered with ClinicalTrials.gov,  number NCT01909453, and EudraCT, number 2013-001176-38. FINDINGS: Between Dec 30, 2013, and April 10, 2015, 577 of 1345 screened  patients were randomly assigned to either the encorafenib plus binimetinib group  (n=192), the encorafenib group (n=194), or the vemurafenib group (n=191). With a  median follow-up of 16·6 months (95% CI 14·8-16·9), median progression-free  survival was 14·9 months (95% CI 11·0-18·5) in the encorafenib plus binimetinib  group and 7·3 months (5·6-8·2) in the vemurafenib group (hazard ratio [HR] 0·54,  95% CI 0·41-0·71; two-sided p<0·0001). The most common grade 3-4 adverse events  seen in more than 5% of patients in the encorafenib plus binimetinib group were  increased γ-glutamyltransferase (18 [9%] of 192 patients), increased creatine  phosphokinase (13 [7%]), and hypertension (11 [6%]); in the encorafenib group  they were palmoplantar erythrodysaesthesia syndrome (26 [14%] of 192 patients),  myalgia (19 [10%]), and arthralgia (18 [9%]); and in the vemurafenib group it  was arthralgia (11 [6%] of 186 patients). There were no treatment-related deaths  except for one death in the combination group, which was considered possibly  related to treatment by the investigator. INTERPRETATION: Encorafenib plus binimetinib and encorafenib monotherapy showed  favourable efficacy compared with vemurafenib. Overall, encorafenib plus  binimetinib appears to have an improved tolerability profile compared with  encorafenib or vemurafenib. Encorafenib plus binimetinib could represent a new  treatment option for patients with BRAF-mutant melanoma. FUNDING: Array BioPharma, Novartis.']",Encorafenib is a BRAF inhibitor.

88,What is commotio cordis?,"[""BACKGROUND: Sudden death due to low-energy blunt trauma to the precordium  (commotio cordis) has been described with a variety of sporting objects.  However, the risk of ventricular fibrillation (VF) relative to the shape of the  impact object is not known. OBJECTIVE: The objective of the current experiment is to test whether the impact  object shape is a clinical variable that affects the risk for commotio cordis. METHODS: In a juvenile swine model, impacts were given in random order with two  different spherical shapes (72 mm diameter, equivalent to a baseball; 42 mm  diameter, equivalent to a golf ball) and a flat round object 72 mm in diameter.  Objects were equal in weight (150 g), thrown at 30 mph, and gated to the  vulnerable portion of the cardiac cycle. RESULTS: Sixteen swine received 144 impacts. The flat object did not cause VF (P  = .01 compared with the two spherical objects), nonsustained VF, ST elevation,  or bundle branch block. The smaller diameter sphere caused VF in nine of 48  impacts (19%), and the larger diameter sphere caused VF in five of 48 impacts  (10%; P = .25). The smaller diameter sphere was associated with a greater  increase in left ventricular pressure (P <.0001 and P = .001 compared with  larger sphere only) and a higher likelihood of ST segment elevations (P <.001  and P = .08 compared with larger sphere only) and bundle branch block (Fisher's  exact P = .008, and Fisher's exact P = .18 compared with larger sphere only). CONCLUSION: The shape of the projectile markedly influences the risk of VF from  chest wall impact. This effect is likely mediated via a greater increase in left  ventricular pressure with smaller diameter objects. Spreading the impact force  over a larger area may decrease the risk of sudden death and has implications  for the design of protective athletic equipment."", 'Sudden arrhythmic death as a result of a blunt chest wall blow has been termed  Commotio Cordis (CC). CC is being reported with increasing frequency with more  than 180 cases now described in the United States Commotio Cordis Registry. The  clinical spectrum is diverse; however young athletes tend to be most at risk,  with victims commonly being struck by projectiles regarded as standard  implements of the sport. Sudden death is instantaneous and victims are most  often found in ventricular fibrillation (VF). Chest blows are not of sufficient  magnitude to cause any significant damage to overlying thoracic structures and  autopsy is notable for the absence of any structural cardiac injury. Development  of an experimental model has allowed for substantial insights into the  underlying mechanisms of sudden death. In anesthetized juvenile swine, induction  of VF is instantaneous following chest impacts that occur during a vulnerable  window before the T wave peak. Other critical variables, including the impact  velocity and location, and the hardness of the impact object have also been  identified. Rapid left ventricular pressure rise following chest impact likely  results in activation of ion channels via mechano-electric coupling. The  generation of inward current through mechano-sensitive ion channels results in  augmentation of repolarization and non-uniform myocardial activation, and is the  cause of premature ventricular depolarizations that are triggers of VF in CC.  Currently available chest protectors commonly used in sport are not adequately  designed to prevent CC. The development of more effective chest protectors and  the widespread availability of automated external defibrillators at youth  sporting events could improve the safety of young athletes.', 'Cardiac concussion, previously known as commotio cordis, occurs in structurally  normal hearts without gross or microscopic injury to the myocardium, cardiac  valves, or coronary arteries, as opposed to other sports-related deaths known to  occur more frequently in structural or congenital heart disease. We describe the  sudden cardiac death of a 2-year-old child, who died as a result of a blunt  force impact to the chest. A thorough medicolegal investigation was necessary to  determine that the child died as a result of foul play.', 'Blunt, non-penetrating trauma of the chest (commotio cordis) can cause sudden  death in individuals without known cardiac disease. Sudden death in commotio  cordis is due to ventricular fibrillation. The timing of the blow must be during  the electric vulnerable period of the ECG cyclus, 10-40 milliseconds before the  peak of the T-wave. The risk of arrhythmia increases progressively, until a  velocity of 64 km/h, and at higher velocities the risk of ventricular  fibrillation begins to diminish. The location of the impact must be directly  over the cardiac silhouette.', 'Commotio cordis is a recognised cause of sudden death in which an apparently  minor blow to the chest causes ventricular fibrillation and cardiac arrest. It  is best known for causing death during games of youth baseball in the United  States, but individual cases have been recorded as a result of a wide range of  activities, principally sporting. The underlying biochemical and  mechano-electric causes have been well documented. However, there are few  reported cases where commotio cordis is implicated as the cause of death in  homicide cases. We present three cases from the north-east of England where an  assault caused death by this mechanism.', 'Moderate pre-cordial mechanical impact can cause sudden cardiac death, even in  the absence of morphological damage to the heart. This is the most severe  expression of a condition termed, in the 19th century, Commotio cordis.  Experimental studies performed in the early 1930s showed that sudden cardiac  death after chest impact is brought about by an intrinsic cardiac response to  the mechanical stimulus. The precise (sub-)cellular mechanisms of this response  are still poorly understood. This article summarises experimental findings on  the condition and relates them to the more recently established concept of  cardiac mechano-electric feedback. As a result, an explanation of the mechanisms  that give rise to sudden cardiac death by Commotio cordis and targets for  further research are suggested.', 'Despite the use of protective gear, a 15-year-old hockey player died when he was  struck in the chest by a puck. This is the fifth recorded hockey death related  to so-called commotio cordis, that is, blunt chest injury without myocardial  structural damage. In light of inadequacies of commercial chest protectors  currently in use for hockey, the authors hope to educate players and coaches  about the danger of blocking shots with the chest. Physicians should be aware  that commotio cordis represents a distinctive pathological condition, in the  event of which immediate recognition, precordial thump, CPR, and defibrillation  are potentially lifesaving. Appropriate medical supervision at amateur hockey  games, 911 telephone access, and on-site automated external defibrillators are  issues that deserve careful consideration.', 'Blunt, non-penetrating trauma of the chest (commotio cordis) can cause sudden  death in individuals without known cardiac disease.

However, case reports of CC in European medical literature can be  traced back for at least 130 years. CC accounts for a small, but important,  subset of sudden death during sporting activities. It is a devastating  electrophysiological event in the young athlete, and one which has generated  considerable concern, both in the medical profession as well as in the public.  The mechanism of sudden death appears to be caused by ventricular fibrillation,  which occurs when the chest impact is delivered within a narrow, electrically  vulnerable portion of the cardiac cycle, that is, during repolarisation, just  before the peak of the T wave. Resuscitation of these victims is possible with  prompt cardiopulmonary resuscitation and defibrillation. Preventive measures,  such as the use of age-appropriate safety baseballs and suitably designed chest  wall protection, may reduce the risk of sudden death and, thus, make the  athletic field a safer place for young athletes.', 'Sudden arrhythmic death as a result of a blunt chest wall blow has been termed  Commotio Cordis (CC).

89,Which gene is involved in CADASIL?,"['Notch3 is a single pass transmembrane protein belonging to the Notch receptor  family. Notch proteins are involved in a very conserved signaling system (Notch  signaling) with a broad spectrum of functions, from cell proliferation and  differentiation to apoptosis. Mutations in Notch3 gene are linked to cerebral  autosomal dominant arteriopathy with subcortical infarcts and  leukoencephalopathy (CADASIL), a disorder characterized by stroke and dementia  in young adults. Studies evaluating Notch3 expression in human differentiated  cells and adult tissues have shown high Notch3 levels only in vascular smooth  muscle cells (VSMC). However, it has been hypothesized that Notch3 is  ubiquitously expressed in adult human tissues. Our aim was to evaluate Notch3  expression in human peripheral blood lymphocytes (PBLs) and fibroblasts from  normal healthy subjects. In both cell types, we examined the expression of  Notch3 by reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) and  quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction (qRT-PCR). Moreover, we  assessed Notch3 protein expression by Western blot analysis. RT-PCR and qRT-PCR  analysis showed the presence of Notch3 mRNA in both cell types. Western blot  analysis confirmed Notch3 protein expression in PBLs and fibroblasts though  showing different profiles. Our data support the expression of Notch3 in adult  human cell types, and suggests that PBLs and fibroblasts could provide readily  available cells for the study of the role of Notch3 expression in the  pathogenetic mechanisms leading to different human disease.', 'Cerebral autosomal dominant arteriopathy with subcortical infarcts and  leucoencephalopathy (CADASIL) is the most common heritable cause of stroke and  vascular dementia in adults. Clinical and neuroimaging features resemble those  of sporadic small-artery disease, although patients with CADASIL have an earlier  age at onset of stroke events, an increased frequency of migraine with aura, and  a slightly variable pattern of ischaemic white-matter lesions on brain MRI.  NOTCH3 (Notch homolog 3), the gene involved in CADASIL, encodes a transmembrane  receptor primarily expressed in systemic arterial smooth-muscle cells.  Pathogenetic mutations alter the number of cysteine residues in the  extracellular domain of NOTCH3, which accumulates in small arteries of affected  individuals. Functional and imaging studies in cultured cells, genetically  engineered mice, and patients with CADASIL have all provided insights into the  molecular and vascular mechanisms underlying this disease. A recent multicentre  trial in patients with cognitive impairment emphasises the feasibility of  randomised trials in patients with CADASIL. In this Review, we summarise the  current understanding of CADASIL, a devastating disorder that also serves as a  model for the more common forms of subcortical ischaemic strokes and pure  vascular dementia.', ""Le CADASIL, ou Cerebral autosomal dominant arteriopathy with subcortical  infarcts and Ieukoencephalopathy est une affection héréditaire des petites  artères cérébrabes survenant chez l'adulte d'âge moyen, due à des mutations du  gène Notch3.

The prevalence of migraine in CADASIL is slightly  higher than in the general population, and the proportion of migraine with aura  is much higher. The pathophysiological mechanism that leads to increased aura  prevalence in CADASIL is unknown. Possible mechanisms of the excess of migraine  with aura are an increased susceptibility to cortical spreading depression (CSD)  or a different expression of CSD. It is also possible that the brainstem  migraine area is involved in CADASIL. Last, it is possible that the NOTCH3  mutation acts as a migraine aura susceptibility gene by itself. In this  narrative review we summarize the literature about migraine in CADASIL, with a  special focus on what CADASIL might teach us about the pathophysiology of  migraine.', 'We reviewed the characteristics of headache in patients with cerebral autosomal  dominant arteriopathy with subcortical infarcts and leukoencephalopathy  (CADASIL), to verify the appropriateness of the International Classification of  Headache Disorders, second edition (ICHD-II) criteria. Available data were found  through Medline/PubMed using the keyword ""cerebral autosomal dominant  arteriopathy with subcortical infarcts and leukoencephalopathy (CADASIL)"". The  search was restricted to studies published in English in the years between 1993  and 2008. We excluded studies that did not report original data on CADASIL and  information regarding the presence of headache. We found 34 studies reporting  data on 749 patients overall; 387 (51.7%) patients had headache. According to  the authors\' definition, 356 (92%) patients were reported as having migraine and  31 (8%) as having headache. Of the 356 patients who were defined as migraineurs,  125 (35.1%) had migraine with aura, 7 (2%) migraine without aura, 156 (43.8%)  unspecified migraine and 68 (19.1%) had more than one type of migraine. Among  the 31 patients reported as suffering from headache, the headache was not  further detailed in 18 (58.1%) patients; it was defined as chronic in 6 (19.3%),  as resembling migraine with aura in 4 (12.9%), as resembling migraine without  aura in 2 (6.5%) and as tension type in 1 (3.2%) patient. In patients with  CADASIL, the headache was usually referred to as migraine and mostly as migraine  with aura. However, this referral is formally incorrect since the diagnostic  criteria for any type of migraine in the ICHD-II require that the disturbance is  not attributed to another disorder. For this reason, we suggest updating the  ICHD-II in relation to CADASIL. Our suggestion is to insert a new category  referred to as Headache attributed to genetic disorder including Headache  attributed to CADASIL.', 'BACKGROUND: Ultrastructural and biochemical abnormalities of mitochondria have  been reported in skeletal muscle biopsies of CADASIL patients with mutations in  the NOTCH3 nuclear gene. Additionally, it was proposed that NOTCH3 gene  mutations may predispose the mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) to mutations. METHODS: We sequenced the entire mitochondrial genome in five Arab patients  affected by CADASIL. RESULTS: The mean number of mtDNA sequence variants (synonymous and  nonsynonymous) in CADASIL patients was not statistically significantly different  from that in controls (p = 0.378). After excluding haplogroup specific single  nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) and proved silent polymorphisms, no known or  novel pathologic mtDNA mutation(s) could be detected in any patient.  Additionally, there was no difference in the prevalence of different  mitochondrial haplogroups between patients and controls. CONCLUSION: Our study group is too small for any valid conclusion to be made.  However, if our observation is confirmed in larger study group, then mtDNA  mutations or mitochondrial haplogroups may not be important in the pathogenesis  of CADASIL.', 'Cerebral autosomal dominant arteriopathy with subcortical infarcts and  leukoencephalopathy, or CADASIL, one of the most common inherited small vessel  diseases of the brain, is characterized by a progressive loss of vascular smooth  muscle cells and extracellular matrix accumulation. The disease is caused by  highly stereotyped mutations within the extracellular domain of the NOTCH3  receptor (Notch3(ECD)) that result in an odd number of cysteine residues. While  CADASIL-associated NOTCH3 mutations differentially affect NOTCH3 receptor  function and activity, they all are associated with early accumulation of  Notch3(ECD)-containing aggregates in small vessels. We still lack mechanistic  explanation to link NOTCH3 mutations with small vessel pathology. Herein, we  hypothesized that excess Notch3(ECD) could recruit and sequester functionally  important proteins within small vessels of the brain. We performed biochemical,  nano-liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry and immunohistochemical  analyses, using cerebral and arterial tissue derived from patients with CADASIL  and mouse models of CADASIL that exhibit vascular lesions in the end- and  early-stage of the disease, respectively. Biochemical fractionation of brain and  artery samples demonstrated that mutant Notch3(ECD) accumulates in disulphide  cross-linked detergent-insoluble aggregates in mice and patients with CADASIL.  Further proteomic and immunohistochemical analyses identified two functionally  important extracellular matrix proteins, tissue inhibitor of metalloproteinases  3 (TIMP3) and vitronectin (VTN) that are sequestered into Notch3(ECD)-containing  aggregates. Using cultured cells, we show that increased levels or aggregation  of Notch3 enhances the formation of Notch3(ECD)-TIMP3 complex, promoting TIMP3  recruitment and accumulation. In turn, TIMP3 promotes complex formation  including NOTCH3 and VTN. In vivo, brain vessels from mice and patients with  CADASIL exhibit elevated levels of both insoluble cross-linked and soluble TIMP3  species. Moreover, reverse zymography assays show a significant elevation of  TIMP3 activity in the brain vessels from mice and patients with CADASIL.  Collectively, our findings lend support to a Notch3(ECD) cascade hypothesis in  CADASIL disease pathology, which posits that aggregation/accumulation of  Notch3(ECD) in the brain vessels is a central event, promoting the abnormal  recruitment of functionally important extracellular matrix proteins that may  ultimately cause multifactorial toxicity. Specifically, our results suggest a  dysregulation of TIMP3 activity, which could contribute to mutant Notch3(ECD)  toxicity by impairing extracellular matrix homeostasis in small vessels.', 'Cerebral Autosomal Dominant Arteriopathy with Subcortical Infarcts and  Leukoencephalopathy (CADASIL) is the best understood cause of dominantly  inherited stroke and results from NOTCH3 mutations that lead to NOTCH3 protein  accumulation and selective arterial smooth muscle degeneration. Previous studies  show that NOTCH3 protein forms multimers. Here, we investigate protein  interactions between NOTCH3 and other vascular Notch isoforms and characterize  the effects of elevated NOTCH3 on smooth muscle gene regulation. We demonstrate  that NOTCH3 forms heterodimers with NOTCH1, NOTCH3, and NOTCH4. R90C and C49Y  mutant NOTCH3 form complexes which are more resistant to detergents than wild  type NOTCH3 complexes. Using quantitative NOTCH3-luciferase clearance assays, we  found significant inhibition of mutant NOTCH3 clearance. In coculture assays of  NOTCH function, overexpressed wild type and mutant NOTCH3 significantly  repressed NOTCH-regulated smooth muscle transcripts and potently impaired the  activity of three independent smooth muscle promoters. Wildtype and R90C  recombinant NOTCH3 proteins applied to cell cultures also blocked canonical  Notch fuction. We conclude that CADASIL mutants of NOTCH3 complex with NOTCH1,  3, and 4, slow NOTCH3 clearance, and that overexpressed wild type and mutant  NOTCH3 protein interfere with key NOTCH-mediated functions in smooth muscle  cells.', 'Cerebral autosomal dominant arteriopathy with subcortical infarcts and  leukoencephalopathy (CADASIL) is a vascular dementing disease caused by  mutations in the NOTCH3 gene, most which are missense mutations leading to an  uneven number of cysteine residues in epidermal growth factor-like repeats in  the extracellular domain of Notch3 receptor (N3ECD). CADASIL is characterized by  degeneration of vascular smooth muscle cells (VSMC) and accumulation of N3ECD on  the VSMCs of small and middle-sized arteries. Recent studies have demonstrated  that impairment of Notch3 signaling is not the primary cause of the disease. In  the present study we used proteomic analysis to characterize the protein  expression pattern of a unique material of genetically genuine cultured human  CADASIL VSMCs. We identified 11 differentially expressed proteins, which are  involved in protein degradation and folding, contraction of VSMCs, and cellular  stress. Our findings indicate that misfolding of Notch3 may cause endoplasmic  reticulum stress and activation of unfolded protein response, leading to  increased reactive oxygen species and inhibition of cell proliferation. In  addition, upregulation of contractile proteins suggests an alteration in the  signaling system of VSMC contraction. The accumulation of N3ECD on the cell  surface possibly upregulates the angiotensin II regulatory feedback loop and  thereby enhances the readiness of the cells to respond to angiotensin II  stimulation.', 'OBJECTIVE: To elucidate the phenotype, genotype, and MRI findings of Korean  patients with cerebral autosomal dominant arteriopathy with subcortical infarcts  and leukoencephalopathy (CADASIL) and mutation carriers. METHODS: The authors studied 40 members of nine unrelated Korean CADASIL  families. After genetic analysis of Notch3, clinical and MRI findings were  correlated in 27 mutation carriers. RESULT: Notch3 mutation sites were C174R (one family, n = 3), R133C (one family,  n = 3), R587C (one family, n = 1), R544C (two families, n = 5), and R75P (four  families, n = 15). The clinical features were typical of CADASIL, but the  frequency of migraine in the Korean population appears low. MRI abnormalities  were found in 54% of the mutant carriers, the most common being white matter  hyperintensities. The prevalence of lacunes and microbleeds increased with  patient age. Anterior temporal areas were less often involved in subjects with  R75P mutations than in those where mutations occurred in other sites (p = 0.02).  Gradient echo imaging identified microbleedings in 33% of mutation carriers (64%  of those with abnormal MRI), whereas diffusion-weighted MRI showed abnormal  findings in only one patient. Neurologic disability was related to the number of  lacunar infarcts and the lesion volume of white matter hyperintensities (p <  0.001) whereas MMSE score was related to the number of lacunar infarcts (p <  0.005). CONCLUSIONS: Although Korean cerebral autosomal dominant arteriopathy with  subcortical infarcts and leukoencephalopathy (CADASIL) mutation carriers show  similar clinical and MRI findings, these abnormalities appear less frequently  than in other populations. Relatively frequent microbleedings on gradient echo  imaging suggest that treatment should be individualized according to MRI  findings. The novel mutation of R75P, not involving a cysteine residue, is  related to less frequent involvement of the anterior temporal area, thus  broadening the spectrum of CADASIL.']","Cerebral autosomal dominant arteriopathy with subcortical infarcts and leukoencephalopathy (CADASIL), the most common form of familial vascular dementia, is caused by mutations of the NOTCH3 gene."
90,Is dupilumab effective for treatment of asthma?,"[""BACKGROUND: Several new biologics have been studied in patients with  eosinophilic asthma with varying degrees of response on clinical outcomes. No  head-to-head trial has directly compared the efficacy of these drugs. OBJECTIVE: To synthesize data on the relative efficacy of benralizumab,  dupilumab, lebrikizumab, mepolizumab, reslizumab, and tralokinumab using network  meta-analysis. DATA SOURCES: We searched PubMed from inception to December 15th, 2017. DATA EXTRACTION AND SYNTHESIS: We used the 'frequentist' methodology with random  effect models using primarily 'netmeta' function in R to generate network  meta-analysis results. Outcomes assessed included changes in forced expiratory  volume-in 1\xa0s (FEV1), asthma control questionnaire (ACQ), and asthma quality of  life questionnaire (AQLQ). We also separately analyzed the annualized rate  ratios for asthma exacerbations for each drug and compared to placebo. For all  outcomes assessed, all drugs were superior to placebo except tralokinumab. In  terms of magnitude of effect, dupilumab, followed by reslizumab and benralizumab  showed the greatest increase in FEV1, 0.16L (95% CIs: 0.08-0.24), 0.13L  (0.10-0.17), and 0.12L (0.08-0.17), compared to placebo. While mepolizumab,  followed by dupliumab, benralizumab, and reslizumab showed reductions in ACQ  scores, in order of magnitude of effect, dupilumab, followed by mepolizumab,  benralizumab, and reslizumab showed the greatest increase in AQLQ scores. All  drugs decreased asthma exacerbations but the results were only significant for  reslizumab and dupilumab. CONCLUSIONS: All drugs except for tralokinumab showed improvements in FEV1, ACQ,  and AQLQ. Only reslizumab and dupilumab were associated with statistically  significant reductions in asthma exacerbation rates."", 'BACKGROUND: Moderate-to-severe asthma remains poorly treated. We evaluated the  efficacy and safety of dupilumab (SAR231893/REGN668), a fully human monoclonal  antibody to the alpha subunit of the interleukin-4 receptor, in patients with  persistent, moderate-to-severe asthma and elevated eosinophil levels. METHODS: We enrolled patients with persistent, moderate-to-severe asthma and a  blood eosinophil count of at least 300 cells per microliter or a sputum  eosinophil level of at least 3% who used medium-dose to high-dose inhaled  glucocorticoids plus long-acting beta-agonists (LABAs). We administered  dupilumab (300 mg) or placebo subcutaneously once weekly. Patients were  instructed to discontinue LABAs at week 4 and to taper and discontinue inhaled  glucocorticoids during weeks 6 through 9. Patients received the study drug for  12 weeks or until a protocol-defined asthma exacerbation occurred. The primary  end point was the occurrence of an asthma exacerbation; secondary end points  included a range of measures of asthma control. Effects on various type 2 helper  T-cell (Th2)-associated biomarkers and safety and tolerability were also  evaluated. RESULTS: A total of 52 patients were assigned to the dupilumab group, and 52  patients were assigned to the placebo group. Baseline characteristics were  similar in the two groups. Three patients had an asthma exacerbation with  dupilumab (6%) versus 23 with placebo (44%), corresponding to an 87% reduction  with dupilumab (odds ratio, 0.08; 95% confidence interval, 0.02 to 0.28;  P<0.001). Significant improvements were observed for most measures of lung  function and asthma control. Dupilumab reduced biomarkers associated with  Th2-driven inflammation. Injection-site reactions, nasopharyngitis, nausea, and  headache occurred more frequently with dupilumab than with placebo. CONCLUSIONS: In patients with persistent, moderate-to-severe asthma and elevated  eosinophil levels who used inhaled glucocorticoids and LABAs, dupilumab therapy,  as compared with placebo, was associated with fewer asthma exacerbations when  LABAs and inhaled glucocorticoids were withdrawn, with improved lung function  and reduced levels of Th2-associated inflammatory markers.

Dupilumab is directed against the α-subunit of the interleukin (IL)-4  receptor and blocks the IL-4 and IL-13 signal transduction. Areas covered:  Pathophysiological role of IL-4 and IL-13 in asthma; mechanism of action of  dupilumab; pharmacology of IL-4 receptor; phase I and phase II studies with  dupilumab; regulatory affairs. Expert opinion: Patients with severe asthma who  are not sufficiently controlled with standard-of-care represent the target  asthma population for dupilumab. If confirmed, efficacy of dupilumab in both  eosinophilic and non-eosinophilic severe asthma phenotype might represent an  advantage over approved biologics for asthma, including omalizumab, mepolizumab,  and reslizumab. Head-to-head studies to compare dupilumab versus other biologics  with different mechanism of action are required. Pediatric studies with  dupilumab are currently lacking and should be undertaken to assess efficacy and  safety of this drug in children with severe asthma. The lack of preclinical data  and published results of the completed four phase I studies precludes a complete  assessment of the pharmacological profile of dupilumab. Dupilumab seems to be  generally well tolerated, but large studies are required to establish its  long-term safety and tolerability.', 'BACKGROUND: Dupilumab is a fully human anti-interleukin-4 receptor α monoclonal  antibody that blocks both interleukin-4 and interleukin-13 signaling. We  assessed its efficacy and safety in patients with uncontrolled asthma. METHODS: We randomly assigned 1902 patients 12 years of age or older with  uncontrolled asthma in a 2:2:1:1 ratio to receive add-on subcutaneous dupilumab  at a dose of 200 or 300 mg every 2 weeks or matched-volume placebos for 52  weeks. The primary end points were the annualized rate of severe asthma  exacerbations and the absolute change from baseline to week 12 in the forced  expiratory volume in 1 second (FEV1) before bronchodilator use in the overall  trial population. Secondary end points included the exacerbation rate and FEV1  in patients with a blood eosinophil count of 300 or more per cubic millimeter.  Asthma control and dupilumab safety were also assessed. RESULTS: The annualized rate of severe asthma exacerbations was 0.46 (95%  confidence interval [CI], 0.39 to 0.53) among patients assigned to 200 mg of  dupilumab every 2 weeks and 0.87 (95% CI, 0.72 to 1.05) among those assigned to  a matched placebo, for a 47.7% lower rate with dupilumab than with placebo  (P<0.001); similar results were seen with the dupilumab dose of 300 mg every 2  weeks. At week 12, the FEV1 had increased by 0.32 liters in patients assigned to  the lower dose of dupilumab (difference vs. matched placebo, 0.14 liters;  P<0.001); similar results were seen with the higher dose. Among patients with a  blood eosinophil count of 300 or more per cubic millimeter, the annualized rate  of severe asthma exacerbations was 0.37 (95% CI, 0.29 to 0.48) among those  receiving lower-dose dupilumab and 1.08 (95% CI, 0.85 to 1.38) among those  receiving a matched placebo (65.8% lower rate with dupilumab than with placebo;  95% CI, 52.0 to 75.6); similar results were observed with the higher dose. Blood  eosinophilia occurred after the start of the intervention in 52 patients (4.1%)  who received dupilumab as compared with 4 patients (0.6%) who received placebo. CONCLUSIONS: In this trial, patients who received dupilumab had significantly  lower rates of severe asthma exacerbation than those who received placebo, as  well as better lung function and asthma control. Greater benefits were seen in  patients with higher baseline levels of eosinophils. Hypereosinophilia was  observed in some patients.

Most patients respond to current  standard of care, i.e., bronchodilators, inhaled glucocorticosteroids and other  anti-inflammatory drugs, but in some adequate asthma control cannot be achieved  with standard treatments. These difficult-to-treat patients would be the target  population for new biological therapies. At present, omalizumab is the only  biological agent approved for the treatment of early-onset, severe IgE-dependent  asthma. It is safe, effective, and well tolerated. Also, discovery of asthma  subtypes suggests new treatments. Half of patients with severe asthma have  T-helper type 2 (Th-2) inflammation and they are expected to benefit from  monoclonal antibody-based treatments. The efficacy of the investigational  monoclonal antibody mepolizumab which targets IL-5 has been well documented in  late onset non-atopic asthma with persistent eosinophilic airway inflammation.  Anti-IL-4 and IL-13 agents (dupilumab, lebrikizumab, and tralokinumab) which  block different Th-2 inflammatory pathways and agents targeting the Th-17  inflammatory pathway in severe refractory asthma are under development. In  clinical trials, these drugs reduce disease activity and improve lung function,  asthma symptoms, and quality of life. However, studies on larger groups of  patients are needed to confirm their safety and efficacy.', 'Dupilumab is the first biological treatment approved for moderate-to-severe  atopic dermatitis (AD). Efficacy and safety have been demonstrated in clinical  trials, but real-life data is still limited. The objective of this study was to  retrospectively evaluate Dupilumab treatment in AD patients in a real-life  clinical setting. Effectiveness and safety outcomes were collected at baseline  and after 2, 6, 10, 24, 39, and 52 weeks by using clinical scores for disease  activity, as well as serological markers. Ninety-four patients from five  dermatological hospitals were included. After 24 weeks of treatment, the median  Investigator Global Assessment (IGA) and Eczema Area and Severity Index (EASI)  showed a significant reduction compared to baseline (3.9 ± 0.7 vs. 1.4 ± 0.8 and  26.5 ± 12.5 vs. 6.4 ± 6.5). Interestingly, we observed rosacea-like folliculitis  as an unexpected side effect in 6.4% of patients. Dupilumab proves to be an  effective and well-tolerated treatment under real-life conditions. The  occurrence of rosacea-like folliculitis warrants further mechanistic  investigation.', 'Atopic dermatitis (AD) is characterized by type 2 helper T (Th2) cell-driven  inflammation.

In Phase I and II studies of adults with  moderate-to-severe AD, dupilumab administered as monotherapy or with topical  corticosteroids resulted in rapid, significant improvements in clinical  efficacy, patient-reported outcomes, and Th2-related serum and tissue  biomarkers, and shifted the RNA expression profile of lesional skin to a more  nonlesional signature. In all clinical studies to date, dupilumab has shown a  favorable safety profile with no dose-limiting toxicity. The robust effects of  dupilumab on skin inflammation and pruritus confirm the pathogenic role of IL-4  and IL-13 signaling in adult AD, and further support the application of Th2  cytokine antagonists in the treatment of this disease.', 'BACKGROUND: Monoclonal antibodies targeting IgE, interleukin-4 and -13, and  interleukin-5 are effective in treating severe type 2 asthma, but new targets  are needed. Itepekimab is a new monoclonal antibody against the upstream alarmin  interleukin-33. The efficacy and safety of itepekimab as monotherapy, as well as  in combination with dupilumab, in patients with asthma are unclear. METHODS: In a phase 2 trial, we randomly assigned, in a 1:1:1:1 ratio, adults  with moderate-to-severe asthma receiving inhaled glucocorticoids plus  long-acting beta-agonists (LABAs) to receive subcutaneous itepekimab (at a dose  of 300 mg), itepekimab plus dupilumab (both at 300 mg; combination therapy),  dupilumab (300 mg), or placebo every 2 weeks for 12 weeks. After randomization,  LABA was discontinued at week 4, and inhaled glucocorticoids were tapered over  weeks 6 through 9. The primary end point was an event indicating a loss of  asthma control, assessed in the itepekimab group and the combination group, as  compared with the placebo group. Secondary and other end points included lung  function, asthma control, quality of life, type 2 biomarkers, and safety. RESULTS: A total of 296 patients underwent randomization. By 12 weeks, an event  indicating a loss of asthma control occurred in 22% of the patients in the  itepekimab group, 27% of those in the combination group, and 19% of those in the  dupilumab group, as compared with 41% of those in the placebo group; the  corresponding odds ratios as compared with placebo were as follows: in the  itepekimab group, 0.42 (95% confidence interval [CI], 0.20 to 0.88; P\u2009=\u20090.02);  in the combination group, 0.52 (95% CI, 0.26 to 1.06; P\u2009=\u20090.07); and in the  dupilumab group, 0.33 (95% CI, 0.15 to 0.70). As compared with placebo, the  forced expiratory volume in 1 second before bronchodilator use increased with  the itepekimab and dupilumab monotherapies but not with the combination therapy.  Itepekimab treatment improved asthma control and quality of life, as compared  with placebo, and led to a greater reduction in the mean blood eosinophil count.  The incidence of adverse events was similar in all four trial groups.

We  used a central randomisation scheme, provided by an interactive voice response  system. Drug kits were coded, providing masking to treatment assignment, and  allocation was concealed. Patients on treatment every 2 weeks and every 4 weeks  received volume-matched placebo every week when dupilumab was not given to  ensure double blinding.

91,Is there a mouse model for Fanconi anemia?,"['Fanconi anemia (FA) is a rare, autosomal recessive disorder characterized by  elevated frequencies of chromosome aberrations, hypersensitivity to DNA  cross-linking agents and predisposition to cancer. At least 5 complementation  groups (FA-A to FA-E) underlie FA and the gene defective in FA-C (FAC) has been  cloned. The mouse orthologue, Fac, maps in close proximity to the f locus, on  chromosome 13, which codes for the flexed-tail mouse phenotype, raising the  possibility that f and Fac are synonymous. If this were the case flexed-tail  mice could be used as mouse models for FA-C to help determine the basic defect  and to evaluate clinical intervention and gene therapy. To further characterize  the flexed-tail mouse, the frequency of micronuclei (a measure of chromosomal  aberrations) induced by mitomycin C (MMC), an alkylating and DNA cross-linking  agent, was analyzed in peripheral blood and bone marrow erythrocytes. Although a  higher spontaneous micronucleus frequency was seen in flexed tail mice in  comparison to wild-type mice, the sensitivity to MMC was not elevated. This  result suggests that f and Fac are different genes and that the flexed-tail  mouse is not a model for FA-C.', 'Fanconi anemia (FA) is a chromosomal instability syndrome characterized by the  presence of pancytopenia, congenital malformations and cancer predisposition.  Six genes associated with this disorder have been cloned, and mice with targeted  disruptions of several of the FA genes have been generated. These mouse models  display the characteristic FA feature of cellular hypersensitivity to DNA  cross-linking agents. Although they do not develop hematological or  developmental abnormalities spontaneously, they mimic FA patients in their  reduced fertility. Studies using these animal models provide valuable insights  into the involvement of apoptotic pathways in FA, and help characterize the  defects in FA hematopoietic cells. In addition, mouse models are also useful for  testing treatments for FA.', 'Fanconi anemia (FA) is a rare autosomal recessive disease, characterized by bone  marrow failure and cancer predisposition. So far, 8 complementation groups have  been identified, although mutations in FANCA account for the disease in the  majority of FA patients. In this study we characterized the hematopoietic  phenotype of a Fanca knockout mouse model and corrected the main phenotypic  characteristics of the bone marrow (BM) progenitors using retroviral vectors.  The hematopoiesis of these animals was characterized by a modest though  significant thrombocytopenia, consistent with reduced numbers of BM  megakaryocyte progenitors. As observed in other FA models, the hematopoietic  progenitors from Fanca(-/-) mice were highly sensitive to mitomycin C (MMC). In  addition, we observed for the first time in a FA mouse model a marked in vitro  growth defect of Fanca(-/-) progenitors, either when total BM or when purified  Lin(-)Sca-1(+) cells were subjected to in vitro stimulation. Liquid cultures of  Fanca(-/-) BM that were stimulated with stem cell factor plus interleukin-11  produced low numbers of granulocyte macrophage colony-forming units, contained a  high proportion of apoptotic cells, and generated a decreased proportion of  granulocyte versus macrophage cells, compared to normal BM cultures. Aiming to  correct the phenotype of Fanca(-/-) progenitors, purified Lin(-)Sca-1(+) cells  were transduced with retroviral vectors encoding the enhanced green fluorescent  protein (EGFP) gene and human FANCA genes. Lin(-)Sca-1(+) cells from Fanca(-/-)  mice were transduced with an efficiency similar to that of samples from  wild-type mice. More significantly, transductions with FANCA vectors corrected  both the MMC hypersensitivity as well as the impaired ex vivo expansion ability  that characterized the BM progenitors of Fanca(-/-) mice.', 'Fanconi anemia (FA) is an autosomal recessive disorder, characterised by  multiple congenital malformations, bone marrow failure and a predisposition to  developing malignancies, especially leukemia. FA cells show increased levels of  spontaneous chromosomal aberrations and a hypersensitivity to DNA cross-linking  agents such as mitomycin C (MMC) and diepoxybutane (DEB). There are at least  eight complementation groups involved in FA, and the genes for two of these  groups, FA(A) and FA(C), have been isolated and cloned. Mouse models for FA(C)  have been developed by replacing exon 8 or exon 9 of Fac with the neo gene. Mice  homozygous for Fac mutations show reduced fertility and hypersensitivity to  induction of chromosomal aberrations by MMC and DEB. To facilitate the study of  cellular defects in vitro, transformed mouse fibroblast cell lines were  established. Cell-killing experiments and cytogenetic analyses were performed on  these cells following treatment with MMC and DEB. Fac-/- showed significant  hypersensitivity to MMC and DEB as compared with Fac+/+ and +/- for both  cellular phenotypes. This is consistent with results obtained from similar  studies on human fibroblasts and lymphoblastoid cell lines. Therefore, these  isogenic transformed mouse fibroblasts provide as in vitro model for further  investigation of the hypersensitivity of Fanconi anemia cells to DNA  cross-linking agents.', 'OBJECTIVE: Fanconi anemia (FA) is a genetically heterogeneous disorder  associated with defects in at least eight genes. The biochemical function(s) of  the FA proteins are unknown, but together they define the FA pathway, which is  involved in cellular responses to DNA damage and in other cellular processes. It  is currently unknown whether all FA proteins are involved in controlling a  single function or whether some of the FA proteins have additional roles. The  aim of this study was 1) to determine whether the FA group A and group C genes  have identical or partially distinct functions, and 2) to have a better model  for human FA. MATERIALS AND METHODS: We generated mice with a targeted mutation in fanca and  crossed them with fancc disrupted animals. Several phenotypes including  sensitivity to DNA cross linkers and ionizing radiation, hematopoietic colony  growth, and germ cell loss were analyzed in fanca-/-, fancc-/-, fanca/fancc  double -/-, and controls. RESULTS: Fibroblast cells and hematopoietic precursors from fanca/fancc  double-mutant mice were not more sensitive to MMC than those of either single  mutant. fanca/fancc double mutants had no evidence for an additive phenotype at  the cellular or organismal level. CONCLUSIONS: These results support a model where both FANCA and FANCC are part  of a multi-protein nuclear FA complex with identical function in cellular  responses to DNA damage and germ cell survival.', 'Fanconi anemia (FA) is a pleiotropic inherited disease that causes bone marrow  failure in children. However, the specific involvement of FA genes in  hematopoiesis and their relation to bone marrow (BM) failure is still unclear.  The increased sensitivity of FA cells to DNA cross-linking agents such as  mitomycin C (MMC) and diepoxybutane (DEB), including the induction of  chromosomal aberrations and delay in the G2 phase of the cell cycle, have  suggested a role for the FA genes in DNA repair, cell cycle regulation, and  apoptosis. We previously reported the cloning of the FA group C gene (FAC) and  the generation of a Fac mouse model. Surprisingly, the Fac -/- mice did not show  any of the hematologic defects found in FA patients. To better understand the  relationship of FA gene functions to BM failure, we have analyzed the in vivo  effect of an FA-specific DNA damaging agent in Fac -/- mice. The mice were found  to be highly sensitive to DNA cross-linking agents; acute exposure to MMC  produced a marked BM hypoplasia and degeneration of proliferative tissues and  caused death within a few days of treatment. However, sequential, nonlethal  doses of MMC caused a progressive decrease in all peripheral blood parameters of  Fac -/- mice. This treatment targeted specifically the BM compartment, with no  effect on other proliferative tissues. The progressive pancytopenia resulted  from a reduction in the number of early and committed hematopoietic progenitors.  These results indicate that the FA genes are involved in the physiologic  response of hematopoietic progenitor cells to DNA damage.', 'Fanconi anemia (FA) is a human disease of bone marrow failure, leukemia,  squamous cell carcinoma, and developmental anomalies, including hypogonadism and  infertility. Bone marrow transplants improve hematopoietic phenotypes but do not  prevent other cancers. FA arises from mutation in any of the 15 FANC genes that  cooperate to repair double stranded DNA breaks by homologous recombination.  Zebrafish has a single ortholog of each human FANC gene and unexpectedly,  mutations in at least two of them (fancl and fancd1(brca2)) lead to  female-to-male sex reversal. Investigations show that, as in human, zebrafish  fanc genes are required for genome stability and for suppressing apoptosis in  tissue culture cells, in embryos treated with DNA damaging agents, and in  meiotic germ cells. The sex reversal phenotype requires the action of Tp53  (p53), an activator of apoptosis. These results suggest that in normal sex  determination, zebrafish oocytes passing through meiosis signal the gonadal soma  to maintain expression of aromatase, an enzyme that converts androgen to  estrogen, thereby feminizing the gonad and the individual. According to this  model, normal male and female zebrafish differ in genetic factors that control  the strength of the late meiotic oocyte-derived signal, probably by regulating  the number of meiotic oocytes, which environmental factors can also alter.  Transcripts from fancd1(brca2) localize at the animal pole of the zebrafish  oocyte cytoplasm and are required for normal oocyte nuclear architecture, for  normal embryonic development, and for preventing ovarian tumors. Embryonic DNA  repair and sex reversal phenotypes provide assays for the screening of small  molecule libraries for therapeutic substances for FA.', 'Fanconi anemia (FA) is a genetically heterogeneous, autosomal recessive disorder  characterized by pediatric bone marrow failure and congenital anomalies. The  effect of FA gene deficiency on hematopoietic development in utero remains  poorly described as mouse models of FA do not develop hematopoietic failure and  such studies cannot be performed on patients. We have created a human-specific  in vitro system to study early hematopoietic development in FA using a  lentiviral RNA interference (RNAi) strategy in human embryonic stem cells  (hESCs). We show that knockdown of FANCA and FANCD2 in hESCs leads to a  reduction in hematopoietic fates and progenitor numbers that can be rescued by  FA gene complementation. Our data indicate that hematopoiesis is impaired in FA  from the earliest stages of development, suggesting that deficiencies in  embryonic hematopoiesis may underlie the progression to bone marrow failure in  FA. This work illustrates how hESCs can provide unique insights into human  development and further our understanding of genetic disease.', 'A number of DNA repair proteins also play roles in telomere metabolism. To  investigate whether the accelerated telomere shortening reported in Fanconi  anemia (FA) hematopoietic cells relates to a direct role of the FA pathway in  telomere maintenance, we have analyzed telomere dynamics in Fancg-deficient  mouse and human cells. We show here that both hematopoietic (stem and  differentiated bone marrow cells, B and T lymphocytes) and nonhematopoietic  (germ cells, mouse embryonic fibroblasts [MEFs]) Fancg(-/-) mouse cells display  normal telomere length, normal telomerase activity, and normal chromosome  end-capping, even in the presence of extensive clastogen-induced cytogenetic  instability (mitomycin C [MMC], gamma-radiation). In addition,  telomerase-deficient MEFs with humanlike telomere length and decreased Fancg  expression (G5 Terc(-/-)/Fancg shRNA3 MEFs) display normal telomere maintenance.  Finally, early-passage primary fibroblasts from patients with FA of  complementation group G as well as primary human cells with reduced FANCG  expression (FANCG shRNA IMR90 cells) show no signs of telomere dysfunction. Our  observations indicate that accelerated telomere shortening in patients with FA  is not due to a role of FANCG at telomeres but instead may be secondary to the  disease. These findings suggest that telomerase-based therapies could be useful  prophylactic agents in FA aplastic anemia by preserving their telomere reserve  in the context of the disease.', 'Fanconi anemia (FA) is a genetic disease resulting in bone marrow failure, high  cancer risks, and infertility, and developmental anomalies including  microphthalmia, microcephaly, hypoplastic radius and thumb. Here we present cDNA  sequences, genetic mapping, and genomic analyses for the four previously  undescribed zebrafish FA genes (fanci, fancj, fancm, and fancn), and show that  they reverted to single copy after the teleost genome duplication. We tested the  hypothesis that FA genes are expressed during embryonic development in tissues  that are disrupted in human patients by investigating fanc gene expression  patterns. We found fanc gene maternal message, which can provide Fanc proteins  to repair DNA damage encountered in rapid cleavage divisions. Zygotic expression  was broad but especially strong in eyes, central nervous system and  hematopoietic tissues. In the pectoral fin bud at hatching, fanc genes were  expressed specifically in the apical ectodermal ridge, a signaling center for  fin/limb development that may be relevant to the radius/thumb anomaly of FA  patients. Hatching embryos expressed fanc genes strongly in the oral epithelium,  a site of squamous cell carcinomas in FA patients. Larval and adult zebrafish  expressed fanc genes in proliferative regions of the brain, which may be related  to microcephaly in FA. Mature ovaries and testes expressed fanc genes in  specific stages of oocyte and spermatocyte development, which may be related to  DNA repair during homologous recombination in meiosis and to infertility in  human patients. The intestine strongly expressed some fanc genes specifically in  proliferative zones. Our results show that zebrafish has a complete complement  of fanc genes in single copy and that these genes are expressed in zebrafish  embryos and adults in proliferative tissues that are often affected in FA  patients. These results support the notion that zebrafish offers an attractive  experimental system to help unravel mechanisms relevant not only to FA, but also  to breast cancer, given the involvement of fancj (brip1), fancn (palb2) and  fancd1 (brca2) in both conditions.']","A number of mouse models have already been generated with a targeted disruption of several Fanconi anemia genes, such as FANCA, FANCF, FANCM, FANCD1, etc."
92,What is the general function of H3K79 methylation?,"['In both mammalian and Drosophila spermatids, the completely histone-based  chromatin structure is reorganized to a largely protamine-based structure.  During this histone-to-protamine switch, transition proteins are expressed, for  example TNP1 and TNP2 in mammals and Tpl94D in Drosophila. Recently, we  demonstrated that in Drosophila spermatids, H3K79 methylation accompanies  histone H4 hyperacetylation during chromatin reorganization. Preceding the  histone-to-protamine transition, the H3K79 methyltransferase Grappa is  expressed, and the predominant isoform bears a C-terminal extension. Here, we  show that isoforms of the Grappa-equivalent protein in humans, rats and mice,  that is DOT1L, have a C-terminal extension. In mice, the transcript of this  isoform was enriched in the post-meiotic stages of spermatogenesis. In human and  mice spermatids, di- and tri-methylated H3K79 temporally overlapped with  hyperacetylated H4 and thus accompanied chromatin reorganization. In rat  spermatids, trimethylated H3K79 directly preceded transition protein loading on  chromatin. We analysed the impact of bacterial infections on spermatid chromatin  using a uropathogenic Escherichia coli-elicited epididymo-orchitis rat model and  showed that these infections caused aberrant spermatid chromatin. Bacterial  infections led to premature emergence of trimethylated H3K79 and hyperacetylated  H4. Trimethylated H3K79 and hyperacetylated H4 simultaneously occurred with  transition protein TNP1, which was never observed in spermatids of mock-infected  rats. Upon bacterial infection, only histone-based spermatid chromatin showed  abnormalities, whereas protamine-compacted chromatin seemed to be unaffected.  Our results indicated that H3K79 methylation is a histone modification conserved  in Drosophila, mouse, rat and human spermatids and may be a prerequisite for  proper chromatin reorganization.', ""Author information: (1)Division of Hematology/Oncology, Children's Hospital Boston, Boston, MA  02115, USA; Department of Pediatrics and the Human Oncology and Pathogenesis  Program, Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center, New York, NY\xa010065, USA.

Electronic address: armstros@mskcc.org."", 'Whereas mono-, di- and trimethylation states of lysines on histones typically  have specific functions, no specific functions have been attributed so far to  the different methylation states of histone H3 Lysine 79 (H3K79) generated by  Dot1. Here we show that Dot1, in contrast to other known histone  methyltransferases, introduces multiple methyl groups via a nonprocessive  mechanism. The kinetic mechanism implies that the H3K79 methylation states  cannot be generated independently, suggesting functional redundancy. Indeed,  gene silencing in yeast, which is dependent on Dot1, relied on global H3K79  methylation levels and not on one specific methylation state. Furthermore, our  findings suggest that histone H2B ubiquitination affects H3K79 trimethylation by  enhancing synthesis of all H3K79 methylation states. Our results suggest that  multiple methylation of H3K79 leads to a binary code, which is expected to limit  the possibilities for regulation by putative demethylases or binding proteins.', 'Methylation of H3K79 is associated with chromatin at expressed genes, though it  is unclear if this histone modification is required for transcription of all  genes. Recent studies suggest that Wnt-responsive genes depend particularly on  H3K79 methylation, which is catalyzed by the methyltransferase DOT1L. Human  leukemias carrying MLL gene rearrangements show DOT1L-mediated H3K79 methylation  and aberrant expression of leukemogenic genes. DOT1L inhibitors reverse these  effects, but their clinical use is potentially limited by toxicity in  Wnt-dependent tissues such as intestinal epithelium. Genome-wide positioning of  the H3K79me2 mark in Lgr5(+) mouse intestinal stem cells and mature intestinal  villus epithelium correlated with expression levels of all transcripts and not  with Wnt-responsive genes per se. Selective Dot1l disruption in Lgr5(+) stem  cells or in whole intestinal epithelium eliminated H3K79me2 from the respective  compartments, allowing genetic evaluation of DOT1L requirements. The absence of  methylated H3K79 did not impair health, intestinal homeostasis, or expression of  Wnt target genes in crypt epithelium for up to 4 months, despite increased crypt  cell apoptosis. Global transcript profiles in Dot1l-null cells were barely  altered. Thus, H3K79 methylation is not essential for transcription of  Wnt-responsive or other intestinal genes, and intestinal toxicity is not  imperative when DOT1L is rendered inactive in vivo.', 'During spermiogenesis, haploid spermatids undergo extensive chromatin remodeling  events in which histones are successively replaced by more basic protamines to  generate highly compacted chromatin. Here we show for the first time that H3K79  methylation is a conserved feature preceding the histone-to-protamine transition  in Drosophila melanogaster and rat. During Drosophila spermatogenesis, the  Dot1-like methyltransferase Grappa (Gpp) is primarily expressed in canoe stage  nuclei. The corresponding H3K79 methylation is a histone modification that  precedes the histone-to-protamine transition and correlates with histone H4  hyperacetylation. When acetylation was inhibited in cultured Drosophila testes,  nuclei were smaller and chromatin was compact, Gpp was little synthesized, H3K79  methylation was strongly reduced, and protamines were not synthesized. The Gpp  isoform Gpp-D has a unique C-terminus, and Gpp is essential for full fertility.  In rat, H3K79 methylation also correlates with H4 hyperacetylation but not with  active RNA polymerase II, which might point towards a conserved function in  chromatin remodeling during the histone-to-protamine transition in both  Drosophila and rat.', 'Residue and degree-specific methylation of histone lysines along with other  epigenetic modifications organizes chromatin into distinct domains and regulates  almost every aspect of DNA metabolism. Identification of histone  methyltransferases and demethylases, as well as proteins that recognize  methylated lysines, has clarified the role of each methylation event in  regulating different biological pathways. Methylation of histone H4 lysine 20  (H4K20me) plays critical roles in diverse cellular processes such as gene  expression, cell cycle progression and DNA damage repair, with each of the three  degrees of methylation (mono-, di- and tri-methylation) making a unique  contribution. Here we discuss recent studies of H4K20me that have greatly  improved our understanding of the regulation and function of this fascinating  histone modification.', 'We created a mouse model wherein conditional expression of an Mll-AF4 fusion  oncogene induces B precursor acute lymphoblastic (ALL) or acute myeloid  leukemias (AML). Gene expression profile analysis of the ALL cells demonstrated  significant overlap with human MLL-rearranged ALL. ChIP-chip analysis  demonstrated histone H3 lysine 79 (H3K79) methylation profiles that correlated  with Mll-AF4-associated gene expression profiles in murine ALLs and in human  MLL-rearranged leukemias. Human MLL-rearranged ALLs could be distinguished from  other ALLs by their H3K79 profiles, and suppression of the H3K79  methyltransferase DOT1L inhibited expression of critical MLL-AF4 target genes.  We thus demonstrate that ectopic H3K79 methylation is a distinguishing feature  of murine and human MLL-AF4 ALLs and is important for maintenance of  MLL-AF4-driven gene expression.', 'Methylation of Lys79 on histone H3 by Dot1p is important for gene silencing. The  elongated structure of the conserved core of yeast Dot1p contains an N-terminal  helical domain and a seven-stranded catalytic domain that harbors the binding  site for the methyl-donor and an active site pocket sided with conserved  hydrophobic residues. The S-adenosyl-L-homocysteine exhibits an extended  conformation distinct from the folded conformation observed in structures of SET  domain histone lysine methyltransferases. A catalytic asparagine (Asn479),  located at the bottom of the active site pocket, suggests a mechanism similar to  that employed for amino methylation in DNA and protein glutamine methylation.  The acidic, concave cleft between the two domains contains two basic residue  binding pockets that could accommodate the outwardly protruding basic side  chains around Lys79 of histone H3 on the disk-like nucleosome surface.  Biochemical studies suggest that recombinant Dot1 proteins are active on  recombinant nucleosomes, free of any modifications.', 'Tri-methylation of histone H3 lysine 9 is important for recruiting  heterochromatin protein 1 (HP1) to discrete regions of the genome, thereby  regulating gene expression, chromatin packaging and heterochromatin formation.  Here we show that HP1alpha, -beta, and -gamma are released from chromatin during  the M phase of the cell cycle, even though tri-methylation levels of histone H3  lysine 9 remain unchanged. However, the additional, transient modification of  histone H3 by phosphorylation of serine 10 next to the more stable methyl-lysine  9 mark is sufficient to eject HP1 proteins from their binding sites. Inhibition  or depletion of the mitotic kinase Aurora B, which phosphorylates serine 10 on  histone H3, causes retention of HP1 proteins on mitotic chromosomes, suggesting  that H3 serine 10 phosphorylation is necessary for the dissociation of HP1 from  chromatin in M phase. These findings establish a regulatory mechanism of  protein-protein interactions, through a combinatorial readout of two adjacent  post-translational modifications: a stable methylation and a dynamic  phosphorylation mark.', 'BACKGROUND: DNA methylation, histone modifications and nucleosome occupancy act  in concert for regulation of gene expression patterns in mammalian cells.  Recently, G9a, a H3K9 methyltransferase, has been shown to play a role in  establishment of DNA methylation at embryonic gene targets in ES cells through  recruitment of de novo DNMT3A/3B enzymes. However, whether G9a plays a similar  role in maintenance of DNA methylation in somatic cells is still unclear. RESULTS: Here we show that G9a is not essential for maintenance of DNA  methylation in somatic cells. Knockdown of G9a has no measurable effect on DNA  methylation levels at G9a-target loci. DNMT3A/3B remain stably anchored to  nucleosomes containing methylated DNA even in the absence of G9a, ensuring  faithful propagation of methylated states in cooperation with DNMT1 through  somatic divisions. Moreover, G9a also associates with nucleosomes in a DNMT3A/3B  and DNA methylation-independent manner. However, G9a knockdown synergizes with  pharmacologic inhibition of DNMTs resulting in increased hypomethylation and  inhibition of cell proliferation. CONCLUSIONS: Taken together, these data suggest that G9a is not involved in  maintenance of DNA methylation in somatic cells but might play a role in  re-initiation of de novo methylation after treatment with hypomethylating drugs,  thus serving as a potential target for combinatorial treatments strategies  involving DNMTs inhibitors.']",ChIP-chip tiling arrays revealed that levels of all degrees of genic H3K79 methylation correlate with mRNA abundance and dynamically respond to changes in gene activity. 
93,Which transcription factors are involved in E-cadherin repression during EMT?,"['Epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT), a crucial event in cancer progression  and embryonic development, is induced by transforming growth factor (TGF)-beta  in mouse mammary NMuMG epithelial cells. Id proteins have previously been  reported to inhibit major features of TGF-beta-induced EMT. In this study, we  show that expression of the deltaEF1 family proteins, deltaEF1 (ZEB1) and SIP1,  is gradually increased by TGF-beta with expression profiles reciprocal to that  of E-cadherin. SIP1 and deltaEF1 each dramatically down-regulated the  transcription of E-cadherin in NMuMG cells through direct binding to the  E-cadherin promoter. Silencing of the expression of both SIP1 and deltaEF1, but  not either alone, completely abolished TGF-beta-induced E-cadherin repression.  However, expression of mesenchymal markers, including fibronectin, N-cadherin,  and vimentin, was not affected by knockdown of SIP1 and deltaEF1.  TGF-beta-induced the expression of Ets1, which in turn activated deltaEF1  promoter activity. Moreover, up-regulation of SIP1 and deltaEF1 expression by  TGF-beta was suppressed by knockdown of Ets1 expression. In addition, Id2  suppressed the TGF-beta- and Ets1-induced up-regulation of deltaEF1. Taken  together, these findings suggest that the deltaEF1 family proteins, SIP1 and  deltaEF1, are necessary, but not sufficient, for TGF-beta-induced EMT and that  Ets1 induced by TGF-beta may function as an upstream transcriptional regulator  of SIP1 and deltaEF1.', 'Breast cancers are highly heterogeneous but can be grouped into subtypes based  on several criteria, including level of expression of certain markers.  Claudin-low breast cancer (CLBC) is associated with early metastasis and  resistance to chemotherapy, while gene profiling indicates it is characterized  by the expression of markers of epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT) - a  phenotypic conversion linked with metastasis. Although the epigenetic program  controlling the phenotypic and cellular plasticity of EMT remains unclear, one  contributor may be methylation of the E-cadherin promoter, resulting in  decreased E-cadherin expression, a hallmark of EMT. Indeed, reduced E-cadherin  often occurs in CLBC and may contribute to the early metastasis and poor patient  survival associated with this disease. Here, we have determined that methylation  of histone H3 on lysine 9 (H3K9me2) is critical for promoter DNA methylation of  E-cadherin in three TGF-β-induced EMT model cell lines, as well as in CLBC cell  lines. Further, Snail interacted with G9a, a major euchromatin methyltransferase  responsible for H3K9me2, and recruited G9a and DNA methyltransferases to the  E-cadherin promoter for DNA methylation. Knockdown of G9a restored E-cadherin  expression by suppressing H3K9me2 and blocking DNA methylation. This resulted in  inhibition of cell migration and invasion in vitro and suppression of tumor  growth and lung colonization in in vivo models of CLBC metastasis. Our study not  only reveals a critical mechanism underlying the epigenetic regulation of EMT  but also paves a way for the development of new treatment strategies for CLBC.', 'Expression of E-cadherin, a hallmark of epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT),  is often lost due to promoter DNA methylation in basal-like breast cancer  (BLBC), which contributes to the metastatic advantage of this disease; however,  the underlying mechanism remains unclear. Here, we identified that Snail  interacted with Suv39H1 (suppressor of variegation 3-9 homolog 1), a major  methyltransferase responsible for H3K9me3 that intimately links to DNA  methylation. We demonstrated that the SNAG domain of Snail and the SET domain of  Suv39H1 were required for their mutual interactions. We found that H3K9me3 and  DNA methylation on the E-cadherin promoter were higher in BLBC cell lines. We  showed that Snail interacted with Suv39H1 and recruited it to the E-cadherin  promoter for transcriptional repression. Knockdown of Suv39H1 restored  E-cadherin expression by blocking H3K9me3 and DNA methylation and resulted in  the inhibition of cell migration, invasion and metastasis of BLBC. Our study not  only reveals a critical mechanism underlying the epigenetic regulation of EMT,  but also paves a way for the development of new treatment strategies against  this disease.', 'Endometrial carcinoma (EC) is the most frequent among infiltrating tumors of the  female genital tract, with myometrial invasion representing an increase in the  rate of recurrences and a decrease in survival. We have previously described  ETV5 transcription factor associated with myometrial infiltration in human ECs.  In this work, we further investigated ETV5 orchestrating downstream effects to  confer the tumor the invasive capabilities needed to disseminate in the early  stages of EC dissemination. Molecular profiling evidenced ETV5 having a direct  role on epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition (EMT). In particular, ETV5  modulated Zeb1 expression and E-Cadherin repression leading to a complete  reorganization of cell-cell and cell-substrate contacts. ETV5-promoted EMT  resulted in the acquisition of migratory and invasive capabilities in  endometrial cell lines. Furthermore, we identified the lipoma-preferred partner  protein as a regulatory partner of ETV5, acting as a sensor for extracellular  signals promoting tumor invasion. All together, we propose ETV5-transcriptional  regulation of the EMT process through a crosstalk with the tumor surrounding  microenvironment, as a principal event initiating EC invasion.', 'Breast tumor interleukin-6 (IL-6) levels increase with tumor grade, and elevated  serum IL-6 correlates with poor breast cancer patient survival.  Epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT) phenotypes such as impaired E-cadherin  expression or aberrant Vimentin induction are associated with enhanced  metastasis and unfavorable clinical outcome in breast cancer. Despite this fact,  few tumor microenvironment-derived extracellular signaling factors capable of  provoking such a phenotypic transition have been identified. In this study, we  showed that IL-6 promoted E-cadherin repression among a panel of estrogen  receptor-alpha-positive human breast cancer cells. Furthermore, ectopic stable  IL-6 expressing MCF-7 breast adenocarcinoma cells (MCF-7(IL-6)) exhibited an EMT  phenotype characterized by impaired E-cadherin expression and induction of  Vimentin, N-cadherin, Snail and Twist. MCF-7(IL-6) cells formed xenograft tumors  that displayed loss of E-cadherin, robust Vimentin induction, increased  proliferative indices, advanced tumor grade and undifferentiated histology.  Finally, we showed aberrant IL-6 production and STAT3 activation in MCF-7 cells  that constitutively express Twist, a metastatic regulator and direct  transcriptional repressor of E-cadherin. To our knowledge, this is the first  study that shows IL-6 as an inducer of an EMT phenotype in breast cancer cells  and implicates its potential to promote breast cancer metastasis.', 'Epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT), a biological process by which polarized  epithelial cells convert into a mesenchymal phenotype, has been implicated to  contribute to the molecular heterogeneity of epithelial ovarian cancer (EOC).  Here we report that a transcription factor--Grainyhead-like 2 (GRHL2) maintains  the epithelial phenotype. EOC tumours with lower GRHL2 levels are associated  with the Mes/Mesenchymal molecular subtype and a poorer overall survival.  shRNA-mediated knockdown of GRHL2 in EOC cells with an epithelial phenotype  results in EMT changes, with increased cell migration, invasion and motility. By  ChIP-sequencing and gene expression microarray, microRNA-200b/a is identified as  the direct transcriptional target of GRHL2 and regulates the epithelial status  of EOC through ZEB1 and E-cadherin. Our study demonstrates that loss of GRHL2  increases the levels of histone mark H3K27me3 on promoters and GRHL2-binding  sites at miR-200b/a and E-cadherin genes. These findings support GRHL2 as a  pivotal gatekeeper of EMT in EOC via miR-200-ZEB1.', 'OBJECTIVE: Pancreatic cancer is characterised by invasive tumour spread and  early metastasis formation. During epithelial-mesenchymal transition, loss of  the cell adhesion molecule E-cadherin is frequent and can be caused by genetic  or epigenetic modifications, recruitment of transcriptional  activators/repressors or post-translational modifications. A study was  undertaken to investigate how E-cadherin expression in human pancreatic  adenocarcinoma and pancreatic cancer cell lines is regulated. METHODS: In 25 human pancreatic cancer resection specimens, the coding region of  the E-cadherin gene (CDH1) was sequenced for somatic mutations. The tumour  samples and 11 established human pancreatic cancer cell lines were analysed by  immunohistochemistry, western blot analysis, chromatin immunoprecipitation and  methylation-specific PCR. The role of specific histone deacetylase inhibitors  (HDACi) on pancreatic tumour cell migration and proliferation was studied in  vitro. RESULTS: Neither somatic mutations nor CDH1 promoter hypermethylation were found  to be responsible for downregulation of E-cadherin in pancreatic cancer. In the  transcriptionally active CDH1 promoter, acetylation of histones H3 and H4 was  detected whereas HDAC1 and HDAC2 were found attached only to a silent promoter.  Expression of ZEB1, a transcription factor known to recruit HDACs, was seen in  E-cadherin-deficient cell lines in which ZEB1/HDAC complexes were found attached  to the CDH1 promoter. Moreover, knockdown of ZEB1 prevented HDAC from binding to  the CDH1 promoter, resulting in histone acetylation and expression of  E-cadherin. HDACi treatment attenuated tumour cell migration and proliferation. CONCLUSIONS: These findings imply an important role for histone deacetylation in  the downregulation of E-cadherin in human pancreatic cancer. Recruitment of  HDACs to the CDH1 promoter is regulated by the transcription factor ZEB1, and  inhibition of HDACs may be a promising antitumour therapy for pancreatic cancer.', 'Endometrial carcinoma (EC) is the most frequent among infiltrating tumors of the  female genital tract, with myometrial invasion representing an increase in the  rate of recurrences and a decrease in survival.

EMT has been  implicated in cancer progression and metastasis as well as the formation of many  tissues and organs during development. Epithelial cells undergoing EMT lose  cell-cell adhesion structures and polarity, and rearrange their cytoskeletons.  Several oncogenic pathways such as transforming growth factor (TGF) -β, Wnt, and  Notch signaling pathways, have been shown to induce EMT. These pathways have  activated transcription factors including Snail, Slug, and the ZEB family which  work as transcriptional repressors of E-cadherin, thereby making epithelial  cells motile and resistant to apoptosis. Mounting evidence shows that EMT is  associated with cell invasion and tumor progression.In this review, we summarize  the characteristic features of EMT, pathways leading to EMT, and the role of EMT  in cell invasion. Three topics are addressed in this review: (1) Definition of  EMT, (2) Signaling pathways leading to EMT, (3) Role of EMT in cell invasion.  Understanding the role of EMT in cell invasion will provide valuable information  for establishing strategies to develop anti-metastatic therapeutics which  modulate malignant cellular processes mediated by EMT.', 'The epithelium to mesenchyme transition is thought to play a fundamental role  during embryonic development and tumor progression. Loss of cell-cell adhesion  and modification of both cell morphology and gene expression are the main events  associated with this transition. There is a large amount of evidence suggesting  that growth factors can initiate these events. Yet, the connection from growth  factor induction to changes in cell adhesion and morphology is largely unknown.  To elucidate this connection, we have investigated the action of IGF-II on  E-cadherin/beta-catenin complex-mediated cell-cell adhesion and on  beta-catenin/TCF-3 mediated gene expression. We can show that (1) IGF-II induces  a rapid epithelium to mesenchymal transition; (2) IGF1R, the receptor for  IGF-II, belongs to the same membrane complex as E-cadherin and beta-catenin; (3)  IGF-II induces a redistribution of beta-catenin from the plasma membrane to the  nucleus and an intracellular sequestration and degradation of E-cadherin; (4)  IGF-II induces the transcription of beta-catenin/TCF-3 target genes. Based on  the given case of IGF-II and E-cadherin/beta-catenin complex, this study reveals  the backbone of a cascade connecting growth factor signaling with cell-cell  adhesion during EMT.']","Downregulation of E-cadherin is a crucial event for epithelial to mesenchymal transition (EMT) in embryonic development and cancer progression. Overexpression of Snail1 (Snail), Snail2 (Slug), Zeb1, Twist, SIP1 and DeltaEF1 have been found to mediate E-cadherin repression, induce the mesenchymal markers vimentin and fibronectin, and finally promote the migratory and invasive capabilities in cancer cells."
94,Which gene has been implicated in Majeed Syndrome?,"[""OBJECTIVE: Monogenic autoinflammatory diseases are disorders of Mendelian  inheritance that are characterized by mutations in genes that regulate innate  immunity and whose typical features are systemic inflammation without high-titer  autoantibodies or antigen-specific T cells. Skin and bone inflammation in the  newborn period have been described in 3 of these autoinflammatory disorders:  neonatal-onset multisystem inflammatory disease, Majeed syndrome, and deficiency  of interleukin-1 (IL-1) receptor antagonist (DIRA) syndrome. This study was  undertaken to present the characteristics of the DIRA syndrome in 2 cases from  Brazil, and describe a novel mutation in IL1RN. METHODS: Two unrelated Brazilian patients were evaluated for the clinical signs  and symptoms of these 3 disorders, and peripheral blood samples were assessed  for mutations in NLRP3, LPIN2, and IL1RN by DNA resequencing analysis. A  mutation in IL1RN that encodes a mutant protein was identified, and the  expression and function of this mutant protein were compared to those of the  wild-type protein. RESULTS: Both patients presented with pustular dermatitis resembling generalized  pustular psoriasis, recurrent multifocal aseptic osteomyelitis, and elevation in  the levels of acute-phase reactants, all of which are features most consistent  with the DIRA syndrome. Chronic lung disease was observed in 1 of the patients,  and jugular venous thrombosis was observed in the other patient. Both patients  showed a partial response to corticosteroid therapy, and 1 patient experienced  an initial improvement of dermatitis with the use of acitretin. Both patients  were homozygous for a novel 15-bp (in-frame) deletion on the IL1RN gene. The  mutated protein expressed in vitro had no affinity with the IL-1 receptor, and  stimulation of the patients' cells with recombinant human IL-1α or IL-1β led to  oversecretion of proinflammatory cytokines, similar to the findings obtained in  previously reported patients. CONCLUSION: The presence of the same homozygous novel mutation in IL1RN in 2  unrelated Brazilian patients suggests that this genetic variant may be a founder  mutation that has been introduced in the Brazilian population."", 'Lipin 2 is a phosphatidic acid phosphatase (PAP) responsible for the penultimate  step of triglyceride synthesis and dephosphorylation of phosphatidic acid (PA)  to generate diacylglycerol.

Although genetic alteration of LPIN2 in humans is known to cause  Majeed syndrome, little is known about the biochemical regulation of its PAP  activity. Here, in an attempt to gain a better general understanding of the  biochemical nature of lipin 2, we have performed kinetic and phosphorylation  analyses. We provide evidence that lipin 2, like lipin 1, binds PA via the  electrostatic hydrogen bond switch mechanism but has a lower rate of catalysis.  Like lipin 1, lipin 2 is highly phosphorylated, and we identified 15  phosphosites. However, unlike lipin 1, the phosphorylation of lipin 2 is not  induced by insulin signaling nor is it sensitive to inhibition of the mammalian  target of rapamycin. Importantly, phosphorylation of lipin 2 does not negatively  regulate either membrane binding or PAP activity. This suggests that lipin 2  functions as a constitutively active PA phosphatase in stark contrast to the  high degree of phosphorylation-mediated regulation of lipin 1. This knowledge of  lipin 2 regulation is important for a deeper understanding of how the lipin  family functions with respect to lipid synthesis and, more generally, as an  example of how the membrane environment around PA can influence its effector  proteins.', 'PURPOSE OF REVIEW: The family of three lipin proteins act as phosphatidate  phosphatase (PAP) enzymes required for glycerolipid biosynthesis, and also as  transcriptional coactivators that regulate expression of lipid metabolism genes.  The genes for lipin-1, lipin-2 and lipin-3 are expressed in key metabolic  tissues, including adipose tissue, skeletal muscle and liver, but the  physiological functions of each member of the family have not been fully  elucidated. Here we examine the most recent studies that provide information  about the roles of lipin proteins in metabolism and human disease. RECENT FINDINGS: Recent studies have identified mutations that cause lipin-1 or  lipin-2 deficiency in humans, leading to acute myoglobinuria in childhood or the  inflammatory disorder Majeed syndrome, respectively. The effects of lipin-1  deficiency appear to include both the loss of glycerolipid building blocks and  the accumulation of lipid intermediates that disrupt cellular function. Several  studies have demonstrated that polymorphisms in the LPIN1 and LPIN2 genes are  associated with metabolic disease traits, including insulin sensitivity,  diabetes, blood pressure and response to thiazolidinedione drugs. Furthermore,  lipin-1 expression levels in adipose tissue and/or liver are positively  correlated with insulin sensitivity. Studies of lipin-1 in adipocytes have shed  some light on its relationship with insulin sensitivity. SUMMARY: Lipin-1 and lipin-2 are required for normal lipid homeostasis and have  unique physiological roles. Future studies, for example using engineered mouse  models, will be required to fully elucidate their specific roles in normal  physiology and disease.', 'The three lipin phosphatidate phosphatase (PAP) enzymes catalyze a step in  glycerolipid biosynthesis, the conversion of phosphatidate to diacylglycerol.  Lipin-1 is critical for lipid synthesis and homeostasis in adipose tissue,  liver, muscle, and peripheral nerves. Little is known about the physiological  role of lipin-2, the predominant lipin protein present in liver and the  deficient gene product in the rare disorder Majeed syndrome. By using  lipin-2-deficient mice, we uncovered a functional relationship between lipin-1  and lipin-2 that operates in a tissue-specific and age-dependent manner. In  liver, lipin-2 deficiency led to a compensatory increase in hepatic lipin-1  protein and elevated PAP activity, which maintained lipid homeostasis under  basal conditions, but led to diet-induced hepatic triglyceride accumulation. As  lipin-2-deficient mice aged, they developed ataxia and impaired balance. This  was associated with the combination of lipin-2 deficiency and an age-dependent  reduction in cerebellar lipin-1 levels, resulting in altered cerebellar  phospholipid composition. Similar to patients with Majeed syndrome,  lipin-2-deficient mice developed anemia, but did not show evidence of  osteomyelitis, suggesting that additional environmental or genetic components  contribute to the bone abnormalities observed in patients. Combined lipin-1 and  lipin-2 deficiency caused embryonic lethality. Our results reveal functional  interactions between members of the lipin family in vivo, and a unique role for  lipin-2 in central nervous system biology that may be particularly important  with advancing age. Additionally, as has been observed in mice and humans with  lipin-1 deficiency, the pathophysiology in lipin-2 deficiency is associated with  dysregulation of lipid intermediates.', 'BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVE: Majeed syndrome is an autosomal recessive disorder  characterised by the triad of chronic recurrent multifocal osteomyelitis,  congenital dyserythropoietic anaemia and a neutrophilic dermatosis that is  caused by mutations in LPIN2. Long-term outcome is poor. This is the first  report detailing the treatment of Majeed syndrome with biological agents and  demonstrates clinical improvement with IL-1blockade. METHODS: We describe the clinical presentation, genetic analysis, cytokine  profiles and response to biological therapy in two brothers with Majeed  syndrome. RESULTS: Both boys were homozygous for a novel 2-base pair deletion in LPIN2  (c.1312_1313delCT; p.Leu438fs+16X), confirming the diagnosis. Their bone disease  and anaemia were refractory to treatment with corticosteroids. Both siblings had  elevated proinflammatory cytokines in their serum, including tumour necrosis  factor α (TNF-α), however a trial of the TNF inhibitor etanercept resulted in no  improvement. IL-1 inhibition with either a recombinant IL-1 receptor antagonist  (anakinra) or an anti-IL-1β antibody (canakinumab) resulted in dramatic clinical  and laboratory improvement. CONCLUSIONS: The differential response to treatment with TNF-α or IL-1 blocking  agents sheds light into disease pathogenesis; it supports the hypothesis that  Majeed syndrome is an IL-1β dependent autoinflammatory disorder, and further  underscores the importance of IL-1 in sterile bone inflammation.', 'McKusick-Kaufman syndrome comprises hydrometrocolpos, polydactyly, and  congenital heart defects and overlaps with Bardet-Biedl syndrome, comprising  retinitis pigmentosa, polydactyly, obesity, mental retardation, and renal and  genital anomalies. Bardet-Biedl syndrome is genetically heterogeneous with three  cloned genes ( BBS2, BBS4, and MKKS) and at least three other known loci ( BBS1,  BBS3, and BBS5). Both McKusick-Kaufman syndrome and Bardet-Biedl syndrome are  inherited in an autosomal recessive pattern, and both syndromes are caused by  mutations in the MKKS gene. However, mutations in MKKS are found in only 4%-11%  of unselected Bardet-Biedl syndrome patients. We hypothesized that an analysis  of patients with atypical Bardet-Biedl syndrome and McKusick-Kaufman syndrome  (Group I; 15 probands) and patients with Bardet-Biedl syndrome who had linkage  results inconsistent with linkage to the other loci (Group II; 12 probands)  could increase the MKKS mutation yield. Both mutant alleles were identified in  only two families in Group II. Single (heterozygous) sequence variations were  found in three Group I families and in two Group II families. Combining these  results with previously published data showed that only one mutant allele was  detected in nearly half of all patients screened to date, suggesting that  unusual mutational mechanisms or patterns of inheritance may be involved.  However, sequencing of the BBS2 gene in these patients did not provide any  evidence of digenic or ""triallelic"" inheritance. The frequency of detected  mutations in MKKS in Group II patients was 24%, i.e., six times higher than the  published rate for unselected BBS patients, suggesting that small-scale linkage  analyses may be useful in suitable families.', 'Meckel syndrome (MKS) is an embryonic lethal, autosomal recessive disorder  characterized by polycystic kidney disease, central nervous system defects,  polydactyly and liver fibrosis. This disorder is thought to be associated with  defects in primary cilia; therefore, it is classed as a ciliopathy. To date, six  genes have been commonly associated with MKS (MKS1, TMEM67, TMEM216, CEP290,  CC2D2A and RPGRIP1L). However, mutation screening of these genes revealed two  mutated alleles in only just over half of our MKS cohort (46 families),  suggesting an even greater level of genetic heterogeneity. To explore the full  genetic complexity of MKS, we performed exon-enriched next-generation sequencing  of 31 ciliopathy genes in 12 MKS pedigrees using RainDance microdroplet-PCR  enrichment and IlluminaGAIIx next-generation sequencing. In family M456, we  detected a splice-donor site change in a novel MKS gene, B9D1. The B9D1 protein  is structurally similar to MKS1 and has been shown to be of importance for  ciliogenesis in Caenorhabditis elegans. Reverse transcriptase-PCR analysis of  fetal RNA revealed, hemizygously, a single smaller mRNA product with a  frameshifting exclusion of B9D1 exon 4. ArrayCGH showed that the second mutation  was a 1.713 Mb de novo deletion completely deleting the B9D1 allele.  Immunofluorescence analysis highlighted a significantly lower level of ciliated  patient cells compared to controls, confirming a role for B9D1 in ciliogenesis.  The fetus inherited an additional likely pathogenic novel missense change to a  second MKS gene, CEP290; p.R2210C, suggesting oligogenic inheritance in this  disorder.', 'The mechanism of profound generalized iduronate sulfatase (IDS) deficiency in a  developmentally delayed female with clinical Hunter syndrome was studied.  Methylation-sensitive RFLP analysis of DNA from peripheral blood lymphocytes  from the patient, using MspI/HpaII digestion and probing with M27 beta, showed  that the paternal allele was resistant to HpaII digestion (i.e., was methylated)  while the maternal allele was digested (i.e., was hypomethylated), indicating  marked imbalance of X-chromosome inactivation in peripheral blood lymphocytes of  the patient. Similar studies on DNA from maternal lymphocytes showed random  X-chromosome inactivation. Among a total of 40 independent maternal fibroblast  clones isolated by dilution plating and analyzed for IDS activity, no IDS- clone  was found. Somatic cell hybrid clones containing at least one active human X  chromosome were produced by fusion of patient fibroblasts with Hprt- hamster  fibroblasts (RJK88) and grown in HAT-ouabain medium. Methylation-sensitive RFLP  analysis of DNA from the hybrids showed that of the 22 clones that retained the  DXS255 locus (M27 beta), all contained the paternal allele in the methylated  (active) form. No clone was isolated containing only the maternal X chromosome,  and in no case was the maternal allele hypermethylated. We postulate from these  studies that the patient has MPS II as a result of a mutation resulting in both  the disruption of the IDS locus on her paternal X chromosome and unbalanced  inactivation of the nonmutant maternal X chromosome.', 'STUDY DESIGN: A single large family, in which adolescent idiopathic scoliosis  (AIS) and pectus excavatum (PE) segregate as an autosomal dominant condition,  was evaluated. Genome-wide linkage analysis and candidate gene sequencing were  performed. OBJECTIVE: To map the disease-causing locus in a large white family in which AIS  and PE cosegregate. SUMMARY OF BACKGROUND DATA: AIS and PE are common musculoskeletal conditions  known to have a genetic component, though few genes have been identified for  either. Genetic studies have been confounded by a lack of large families in  which the disorders segregate. METHODS: Clinical examinations were performed on the proband, who underwent  posterior spinal fusion, and 12 additional affected family members. To map a  gene causing AIS and PE, a genome-wide linkage analysis was performed with the  Affymetrix Mapping 10 K XbaI array on 13 affected and 10 unaffected family  members. Candidate genes were sequenced. RESULTS: AIS was present in 13 female family members and PE was present in 3  males and 1 female. Genome-wide linkage analysis resulted in a linkage peak on  chromosome 18 q with a maximum parametric multipoint logarithm of the odds score  of 3.86. Recombinants delineated the critical genetic region to an interval of  6.4 cM between SNP_A-1519369 and SNP_A-1507702, corresponding to a 7.06-Mb  region (hg18: chr18:26342508-34395660). The chromosome 18 q linkage region  contains more than 30 genes. Resequencing of the coding regions of 21 candidate  genes in the region did not reveal any causative mutation. CONCLUSION: Linkage analysis in this large family demonstrated a novel locus for  AIS and PE on chromosome 18 q. Because of the increased frequency of PE in  family members of AIS patients, consideration of family members with PE as  affected may increase the power of AIS genetic linkage studies.', 'Two consanguineous Qatari siblings presented for evaluation: a 17-4/12-year-old  male with hypogonadotropic hypogonadism, alopecia, intellectual disability, and  microcephaly and his 19-year-old sister with primary amenorrhea, alopecia, and  normal cognition. Both required hormone treatment to produce secondary sex  characteristics and pubertal development beyond Tanner 1. SNP array analysis of  both probands was performed to detect shared regions of homozygosity which may  harbor homozygous mutations in a gene causing their common features of abnormal  pubertal development, alopecia, and variable cognitive delay. Our patients  shared multiple homozygous genomic regions; ten shared regions were >1\u2009Mb in  length and constituted 0.99% of the genome. DCAF17, encoding a transmembrane  nuclear protein of uncertain function, was the only gene identified in a  homozygous region known to cause hypogonadotropic hypogonadism. DCAF17 mutations  are associated with Woodhouse-Sakati syndrome, a rare disorder characterized by  alopecia, hypogonadotropic hypogonadism, sensorineural hearing loss, diabetes  mellitus, and extrapyramidal movements. Sequencing of the coding exons and  flanking intronic regions of DCAF17 in the proband revealed homozygosity for a  previously described founder mutation (c.436delC). Targeted DCAF17 sequencing of  his affected sibling revealed the same homozygous mutation. This family  illustrates the utility of SNP array testing in consanguineous families to  efficiently and inexpensively identify regions of genomic homozygosity in which  genetic candidates for recessive conditions can be identified.']",Homozygous mutations in LPIN2 are responsible for the syndrome of chronic recurrent multifocal osteomyelitis and congenital dyserythropoietic anaemia (Majeed syndrome).
95,What is targeted by Palbociclib?,"['Overexpression of the epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) is a common  characteristic of head and neck squamous cell carcinomas (HNSCC). Cetuximab is a  chimeric anti-EGFR monoclonal antibody (mAb) with multiple approved indications  in HNSCC, including with radiation therapy (RT) for locoregionally advanced  disease, as monotherapy after platinum progression, and with  platinum/5-fluorouracil for recurrent or metastatic disease. There remain,  however, numerous unanswered questions regarding the optimal use of cetuximab in  HNSCC, including patient selection, its mechanisms of action and resistance, the  effect of human papillomavirus status on outcomes, its role when combined with  induction chemotherapy or adjuvant radiation, and optimal management of skin  toxicity and hypersensitivity reactions. In addition, a variety of other  anti-EGFR agents (the multitargeted small molecule tyrosine kinase inhibitors  [TKIs] lapatinib, dacomitinib, and afatinib and the anti-EGFR mAbs zalutumumab,  nimotuzumab, and panitumumab) are currently under investigation in phase II and  III clinical trials in different HNSCC therapeutic settings. The anti-EGFR TKI  erlotinib is currently in phase III development for oral cancer prevention.  Numerous other drugs are in earlier stages of development for HNSCC treatment,  including novel anti-EGFR mAbs (MEHD7945A, necitumumab, and RO5083945),  small-molecule TKIs (vandetanib, icotinib, and CUDC-101), EGFR antisense,  various add-on therapies to radiation and chemotherapy (bevacizumab,  interleukin-12, lenalidomide, alisertib, and VTX-2337), and drugs (temsirolimus,  everolimus, OSI-906, dasatinib, and PX-866) intended to overcome resistance to  anti-EGFR agents. Overall, a wealth of clinical trial data is expected in the  coming years, with the potential to modify significantly the approach to  anti-EGFR therapy for HNSCC.', 'PURPOSE OF REVIEW: The epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) is overexpressed  in many nonsmall cell lung cancers (NSCLCs). Blockade of EGFR by monoclonal  antibodies has been studied as a strategy to improve the outcome of first-line  chemotherapy in patients with NSCLC. The present review updates the findings  from phase III trials. RECENT FINDINGS: Cetuximab improved survival when combined with first-line  chemotherapy and this benefit was limited to patients with high EGFR expression  in their tumors. A Southwest Oncology Group study currently prospectively  evaluates the predictive biomarkers for cetuximab. In the SQUIRE phase III  trial, necitumumab added to cisplatin and gemcitabine increased the survival in  patients with advanced squamous cell NSCLC. The INSPIRE trial studied  chemotherapy with and without necitumumab in patients with nonsquamous NSCLC but  was prematurely halted because of increased thromboembolic events with  chemotherapy and necitumumab. SUMMARY: EGFR monoclonal antibodies improved the outcome including survival in  selected patients with advanced NSCLC. Prospective validation of predictive  biomarkers is ongoing.', 'Blockade of the epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) by monoclonal antibodies  is a strategy to improve outcome in patients with non-small cell lung cancer.  Cetuximab, a chimeric anti-EGFR monoclonal antibody, has been studied in  combination with different chemotherapy protocols in both phase II and phase III  trials in patients with advanced NSCLC. In the phase III FLEX trial, cetuximab  added to cisplatin/vinorelbine resulted in an absolute overall survival benefit  of 1.2 months compared to the same chemotherapy alone in patients with advanced  EGFR-expressing NSCLC. In the second phase III trial, cetuximab added to  carboplatin plus paclitaxed failed to improve progression-free survival but  suggested a survival benefit similar to that seen in the FLEX trial. However,  the benefit in survival reached statistical significance only in the FLEX trial.  A meta-analysis that included patients from four randomized trials confirmed the  efficacy of cetuximab when added to chemotherapy. Thus addition of cetuximab to  platinum-based chemotherapy represents a new treatment option for patients with  advanced NSCLC. Matuzumab and panitumumab have also been evaluated in phase II  trials. Necitumumab is currently evaluated in combination with chemotherapy in  two randomized phase III trials.', 'BACKGROUND: Necitumumab is a second-generation, recombinant, human  immunoglobulin G1 EGFR antibody. In this study, we aimed to compare treatment  with necitumumab plus gemcitabine and cisplatin versus gemcitabine and cisplatin  alone in patients with previously untreated stage IV squamous non-small-cell  lung cancer. METHODS: We did this open-label, randomised phase 3 study at 184 investigative  sites in 26 countries. Patients aged 18 years or older with histologically or  cytologically confirmed stage IV squamous non-small-cell lung cancer, with an  Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group (ECOG) performance status of 0-2 and adequate  organ function and who had not received previous chemotherapy for their disease  were eligible for inclusion. Enrolled patients were randomly assigned centrally  1:1 to a maximum of six 3-week cycles of gemcitabine and cisplastin chemotherapy  with or without necitumumab according to a block randomisation scheme (block  size of four) by a telephone-based interactive voice response system or  interactive web response system. Chemotherapy was gemcitabine 1250 mg/m(2)  administered intravenously over 30 min on days 1 and 8 of a 3-week cycle and  cisplatin 75 mg/m(2) administered intravenously over 120 min on day 1 of a  3-week cycle. Necitumumab 800 mg, administered intravenously over a minimum of  50 min on days 1 and 8, was continued after the end of chemotherapy until  disease progression or intolerable toxic side-effects occurred. Randomisation  was stratified by ECOG performance status and geographical region. Neither  physicians nor patients were masked to group assignment because of the expected  occurrence of acne-like rash--a class effect of EGFR antibodies--that would have  unmasked most patients and investigators to treatment. The primary endpoint was  overall survival, analysed by intention to treat. We report the final clinical  analysis. This study is registered with ClinicalTrials.gov, number NCT00981058. FINDINGS: Between Jan 7, 2010, and Feb 22, 2012, we enrolled 1093 patients and  randomly assigned them to receive necitumumab plus gemcitabine and cisplatin  (n=545) or gemcitabine and cisplatin (n=548). Overall survival was significantly  longer in the necitumumab plus gemcitabine and cisplatin group than in the  gemcitabine and cisplatin alone group (median 11·5 months [95% CI 10·4-12·6]) vs  9·9 months [8·9-11·1]; stratified hazard ratio 0·84 [95% CI 0·74-0·96; p=0·01]).  In the necitumumab plus gemcitabine and cisplatin group, the number of patients  with at least one grade 3 or worse adverse event was higher (388 [72%] of 538  patients) than in the gemcitabine and cisplatin group (333 [62%] of 541), as was  the incidence of serious adverse events (257 [48%] of 538 patients vs 203 [38%]  of 541). More patients in the necitumumab plus gemcitabine and cisplatin group  had grade 3-4 hypomagnesaemia (47 [9%] of 538 patients in the necitumumab plus  gemcitabine and cisplatin group vs six [1%] of 541 in the gemcitabine and  cisplatin group) and grade 3 rash (20 [4%] vs one [<1%]). Including events  related to disease progression, adverse events with an outcome of death were  reported for 66 (12%) of 538 patients in the necitumumab plus gemcitabine and  cisplatin group and 57 (11%) of 541 patients in the gemcitabine and cisplatin  group; these were deemed to be related to study drugs in 15 (3%) and ten (2%)  patients, respectively. Overall, we found that the safety profile of necitumumab  plus gemcitabine and cisplatin was acceptable and in line with expectations. INTERPRETATION: Our findings show that the addition of necitumumab to  gemcitabine and cisplatin chemotherapy improves overall survival in patients  with advanced squamous non-small-cell lung cancer and represents a new  first-line treatment option for this disease. FUNDING: Eli Lilly and Company.', 'PURPOSE: This study aimed to determine a maximum tolerated dose (MTD) and  recommended dose for disease-directed studies of necitumumab (IMC-11F8), a fully  human IgG(1) monoclonal antibody directed at the epidermal growth factor  receptor, and to characterize the safety profile, pharmacokinetics, preliminary  antitumor activity, and immunogenicity of necitumumab. EXPERIMENTAL DESIGN: Patients with advanced solid malignancies were treated with  100 to 1,000 mg (flat dosing) necitumumab followed by a 2-week pharmacokinetics  sampling period, before beginning 6-week cycles of therapy. RESULTS: Sixty patients received necitumumab weekly (29 patients) or every other  week (31 patients). Two patients receiving 1,000 mg every 2 weeks experienced  dose-limiting toxicities (DLT; grade 3 headache), accompanied by grade 3 nausea  and vomiting in one patient. Occurring hours after the initial dose, these DLTs  established 800 mg as the MTD. Mild dose-related skin toxicity was the most  common drug-related toxicity (80%). One patient in each arm experienced grade 3  acneform rash, which responded to oral antibiotics and topical therapy. Toxicity  was similar on both schedules. Necitumumab exhibited saturable elimination and  nonlinear pharmacokinetics. At 800 mg (both arms), its half-life was  approximately 7 days. All patients treated with >or=600 mg necitumumab achieved  target trough concentrations (>or=40 microg/mL). Antibodies against necitumumab  were not detected. Partial response and stable disease were experienced by 2 and  16 patients, respectively. CONCLUSION: Well tolerated, necitumumab is associated with preliminary evidence  of antitumor activity, and achieves biologically relevant concentrations  throughout the dosing period. The recommended dose of necitumumab for further  clinical development is 800 mg (flat dose) weekly or every 2 weeks based on the  clinical setting.', 'Clinical and preclinical data support a significant role for inhibitors of the  cyclin-dependent kinases (CDKs) 4 and 6 in the treatment of patients with breast  cancer. Recently, based on data showing improvement in progression-free  survival, the use of palbociclib (Ibrance; Pfizer, Inc.) in combination with  endocrine agents was approved to treat patients with hormone receptor-positive  advanced disease. Importantly, 2 other CDK4/6 inhibitors, abemaciclib  (LY2835219; Lilly) and ribociclib (LEE011; Novartis), are in the late stage of  clinical development. In this review, we will focus on clinical data on these 2  new drugs, highlighting their differences compared to palbociclib in terms of  single-agent activity, central nervous system penetration, and common adverse  events. In addition, we will present the ongoing clinical trials and discuss  future directions in the field.', 'Cyclins and cyclin-dependent protein kinases (CDKs) are important regulatory  components that are required for cell cycle progression. The levels of the cell  cycle CDKs are generally constant and their activities are controlled by  cyclins, proteins whose levels oscillate during each cell cycle. Additional CDK  family members were subsequently discovered that play significant roles in a  wide range of activities including the control of gene transcription,  metabolism, and neuronal function. In response to mitogenic stimuli, cells in  the G1 phase of the cell cycle produce cyclins of the D type that activate  CDK4/6. These activated enzymes catalyze the monophosphorylation of the  retinoblastoma protein. Then CDK2-cyclin E catalyzes the hyperphosphorylation of  Rb that promotes the release and activation of the E2F transcription factors,  which in turn lead to the generation of several proteins required for cell cycle  progression. As a result, cells pass through the G1-restriction point and are  committed to complete cell division. CDK2-cyclin A, CDK1-cyclin A, and  CDK1-cyclin B are required for S, G2, and M-phase progression. Increased cyclin  or CDK expression or decreased levels of endogenous CDK inhibitors such as INK4  or CIP/KIP have been observed in various cancers. In contrast to the mutational  activation of EGFR, Kit, or B-Raf in the pathogenesis of malignancies, mutations  in the CDKs that cause cancers are rare. Owing to their role in cell  proliferation, CDKs represent natural targets for anticancer therapies.  Abemaciclib (LY2835219), ribociclib (Lee011), and palbociclib (Ibrance(®) or  PD0332991) target CDK4/6 with IC50 values in the low nanomolar range.  Palbociclib and other CDK inhibitors bind in the cleft between the small and  large lobes of the CDKs and inhibit the binding of ATP. Like ATP, palbociclib  forms hydrogen bonds with residues in the hinge segment of the cleft. Like the  adenine base of ATP, palbociclib interacts with catalytic spine residues CS6 and  CS7. CDK antagonists are in clinical trials for the treatment of a variety of  malignancies. Significantly, palbociclib has been approved by the FDA for the  treatment of hormone-receptor positive/human epidermal growth factor receptor-2  negative breast cancer in conjunction with letrozole as a first-line therapy and  with fulvestrant as a second-line treatment. As inhibitors of the cell cycle, it  is not surprising that one of their most common toxicities is myelosuppression  with decreased neutrophil production.', 'Acute kidney injury (AKI) is a potentially fatal syndrome characterized by a  rapid decline in kidney function caused by ischemic or toxic injury to renal  tubular cells. The widely used chemotherapy drug cisplatin accumulates  preferentially in the renal tubular cells and is a frequent cause of  drug-induced AKI. During the development of AKI the quiescent tubular cells  reenter the cell cycle. Strategies that block cell-cycle progression ameliorate  kidney injury, possibly by averting cell division in the presence of extensive  DNA damage. However, the early signaling events that lead to cell-cycle  activation during AKI are not known. In the current study, using mouse models of  cisplatin nephrotoxicity, we show that the G1/S-regulating cyclin-dependent  kinase 4/6 (CDK4/6) pathway is activated in parallel with renal cell-cycle entry  but before the development of AKI. Targeted inhibition of CDK4/6 pathway by  small-molecule inhibitors palbociclib (PD-0332991) and ribociclib (LEE011)  resulted in inhibition of cell-cycle progression, amelioration of kidney injury,  and improved overall survival. Of additional significance, these compounds were  found to be potent inhibitors of organic cation transporter 2 (OCT2), which  contributes to the cellular accumulation of cisplatin and subsequent kidney  injury. The unique cell-cycle and OCT2-targeting activities of palbociclib and  LEE011, combined with their potential for clinical translation, support their  further exploration as therapeutic candidates for prevention of AKI.', 'Glioblastoma multiforme (GBM) is the most common primary brain tumor in adults,  and the limited available treatment options have not meaningfully impacted  patient survival in the past decades. Such poor outcomes can be at least partly  attributed to the inability of most drugs tested to cross the blood-brain  barrier and reach all areas of the glioma. The objectives of these studies were  to visualize and compare by matrix-assisted laser desorption ionization (MALDI)  imaging mass spectrometry the brain and tumor distribution of the  phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase (PI3K) inhibitors pictilisib (GDC-0941,  2-(1H-indazol-4-yl)-6-(4-methanesulfonyl-piperazin-1-ylmethyl)-4-morpholin-4-yl-thieno[3,2-d]pyrimidine)  and GNE-317  [5-(6-(3-methoxyoxetan-3-yl)-7-methyl-4-morpholinothieno[3,2-d]pyrimidin-2-yl)pyrimidin-2-amine]  in U87 and GS2 orthotopic models of GBM, models that exhibit differing  blood-brain barrier characteristics. Following administration to tumor-bearing  mice, pictilisib was readily detected within tumors of the contrast-enhancing  U87 model whereas it was not located in tumors of the nonenhancing GS2 model. In  both GBM models, pictilisib was not detected in the healthy brain. In contrast,  GNE-317 was uniformly distributed throughout the brain in the U87 and GS2  models. MALDI imaging revealed also that the pictilisib signal varied regionally  by up to 6-fold within the U87 tumors whereas GNE-317 intratumor levels were  more homogeneous. Liquid chromatography coupled with tandem mass spectrometry  (LC-MS/MS) analyses of the nontumored half of the brain showed pictilisib had  brain-to-plasma ratios lower than 0.03 whereas they were greater than 1 for  GNE-317, in agreement with their brain penetration properties. These results in  orthotopic models representing either the contrast-enhancing or invasive areas  of GBM clearly demonstrate the need for whole-brain distribution to potentially  achieve long-term efficacy in GBM.', 'Cancer cells bypass normal controls over mitotic cell-cycle progression to  achieve a deregulated state of proliferation. The retinoblastoma tumor  suppressor protein (pRb) governs a key cell-cycle checkpoint that normally  prevents G1-phase cells from entering S-phase in the absence of appropriate  mitogenic signals. Cancer cells frequently overcome pRb-dependent growth  suppression via constitutive phosphorylation and inactivation of pRb function by  cyclin-dependent kinase (CDK) 4 or CDK6 partnered with D-type cyclins. Three  selective CDK4/6 inhibitors, palbociclib (Ibrance; Pfizer), ribociclib  (Novartis), and abemaciclib (Lilly), are in various stages of development in a  variety of pRb-positive tumor types, including breast cancer, melanoma,  liposarcoma, and non-small cell lung cancer. The emerging, positive clinical  data obtained to date finally validate the two decades-old hypothesis that the  cyclin D-CDK4/6 pathway is a rational target for cancer therapy.']",Necitumumab is a fully human IgG(1) monoclonal antibody directed at the epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR).

96,What protein is encoded by the GRN gene?,"[""Neurodegenerative diseases such as Alzheimer's disease have proven resistant to  new treatments. The complexity of neurodegenerative disease mechanisms can be  highlighted by accumulating evidence for a role for a growth factor, progranulin  (PGRN). PGRN is a glycoprotein encoded by the GRN/Grn gene with multiple  cellular functions, including neurotrophic, anti-inflammatory and lysosome  regulatory properties. Mutations in the GRN gene can lead to frontotemporal  lobar degeneration (FTLD), a cause of dementia, and neuronal ceroid  lipofuscinosis (NCL), a lysosomal storage disease. Both diseases are associated  with loss of PGRN function resulting, amongst other features, in enhanced  microglial neuroinflammation and lysosomal dysfunction. PGRN has also been  implicated in Alzheimer's disease (AD). Unlike FTLD, increased expression of  PGRN occurs in brains of human AD cases and AD model mice, particularly in  activated microglia. How microglial PGRN might be involved in AD and other  neurodegenerative diseases will be discussed. A unifying feature of PGRN in  diseases might be its modulation of lysosomal function in neurons and microglia.  Many experimental models have focused on consequences of PGRN gene deletion:  however, possible outcomes of increasing PGRN on microglial inflammation and  neurodegeneration will be discussed. We will also suggest directions for future  studies on PGRN and microglia in relation to neurodegenerative diseases."", 'Numerous kindreds with familial frontotemporal lobar degeneration have been  linked to mutations in microtubule-associated protein tau (MAPT) or progranulin  (GRN) genes. While there are many similarities in the clinical manifestations  and associated neuroimaging findings, there are also distinct differences. In  this review, we compare and contrast the demographic/inheritance  characteristics, histopathology, pathophysiology, clinical aspects, and key  neuroimaging findings between those with MAPT and GRN mutations.', 'Loss-of-function mutations in the gene encoding for the protein progranulin  (PGRN), GRN, are one of the major genetic abnormalities involved in  frontotemporal lobar degeneration. However, genetic variations, mainly missense,  in GRN have also been linked to other neurodegenerative diseases. We found 12  different pathogenic/likely pathogenic variants in 21 patients identified in a  cohort of Italian patients affected by various neurodegenerative disorders. We  detected the p.Thr272SerfsTer10 as the most frequent, followed by the  c.1179+3A>G variant. We characterized the clinical phenotype of 12 patients from  3 pedigrees carrying the c.1179+3A>G variant, demonstrated the pathogenicity of  this mutation, and detected other rarer variants causing haploinsufficiency  (p.Met1?, c.709-2A>T, p.Gly79AspfsTer39). Finally, by applying bioinformatics,  neuropathological, and biochemical studies, we characterized 6  missense/synonymous variants (p.Asp94His, p.Gly117Asp, p.Ala266Pro, p.Val279Val,  p.Arg298His, p.Ala505Gly), including 4 previously unreported. The designation of  variants is crucial for genetic counseling and the enrollment of patients in  clinical studies.', 'It has been more than a decade since heterozygous loss-of-function mutations in  the progranulin gene (GRN) were first identified as an important genetic cause  of frontotemporal lobar degeneration (FTLD). Due to the highly diverse  biological functions of the progranulin (PGRN) protein, encoded by GRN, multiple  possible disease mechanisms have been proposed. Early work focused on the  neurotrophic properties of PGRN and its role in the inflammatory response.  However, since the discovery of homozygous GRN mutations in patients with a  lysosomal storage disorder, investigation into the possible roles of PGRN and  its proteolytic cleavage products granulins, in lysosomal function and  dysfunction, has taken center stage. In this chapter, we summarize the GRN  mutational spectrum and its associated phenotypes followed by an in-depth  discussion on the possible disease mechanisms implicated in FTLD-GRN. We  conclude with key outstanding questions which urgently require answers to ensure  safe and successful therapy development for GRN mutation carriers.', 'The granulin protein (also known as, and hereafter referred to as, progranulin)  is a secreted glycoprotein that contributes to overall brain health.  Heterozygous loss-of-function mutations in the gene encoding the progranulin  protein (Granulin Precursor, GRN) are a common cause of familial frontotemporal  dementia (FTD). Gene therapy approaches that aim to increase progranulin  expression from a single wild-type allele, an area of active investigation for  the potential treatment of GRN-dependent FTD, will benefit from the availability  of a mouse model that expresses a genomic copy of the human GRN gene. Here we  report the development and characterization of a novel mouse model that  expresses the entire human GRN gene in its native genomic context as a single  copy inserted into a defined locus (Hprt) in the mouse genome. We show that  human and mouse progranulin are expressed in a similar tissue-specific pattern,  suggesting that the two genes are regulated by similar mechanisms. Human  progranulin rescues a phenotype characteristic of progranulin-null mice, the  exaggerated and early deposition of the aging pigment lipofuscin in the brain,  indicating that the two proteins are functionally similar. Longitudinal  behavioural and neuropathological analyses revealed no significant differences  between wild-type and human progranulin-overexpressing mice up to 18\xa0months of  age, providing evidence that long-term increase of progranulin levels is well  tolerated in mice. Finally, we demonstrate that human progranulin expression can  be increased in the brain using an antisense oligonucleotide that inhibits a  known GRN-regulating micro-RNA, demonstrating that the transgene is responsive  to potential gene therapy drugs. Human progranulin-expressing mice represent a  novel and valuable tool to expedite the development of progranulin-modulating  therapeutics.', 'The mouse Grg gene encodes a 197 amino acid nuclear protein homologous to the  amino-terminal domain of the product of the groucho (gro) gene of the Drosophila  Enhancer of split complex. Recent work has suggested that the gro protein  functions as a transcriptional corepressor during Drosophila development. We  therefore examined possible roles of the mouse Grg protein in DNA binding and in  vitro transcription. No sequence-specific DNA binding activity was detected by  polymerase chain reaction-DNA binding site selection nor was the glutamine-rich  Grg protein capable of acting as an activation domain in an in vivo  transactivation assay. However, depletion of Grg protein from HeLa nuclear  extracts inhibited the in vitro transcription activity of the extracts. We  suggest that Grg protein may interact with components of the basal transcription  machinery.', 'Progranulin (PGRN) is known to play a role in the pathogenesis of  neurodegenerative diseases. Recently, it has been demonstrated that patients  with the homozygous mutation in the GRN gene present with neuronal ceroid  lipofuscinosis, and there is growing evidence that PGRN is related to lysosomal  function. In the present study, we investigated the possible role of PGRN in the  lysosomes of activated microglia in the cerebral cortex after traumatic brain  injury (TBI). We showed that the mouse GRN gene has two possible coordinated  lysosomal expression and regulation (CLEAR) sequences that bind to transcription  factor EB (TFEB), a master regulator of lysosomal genes. PGRN was colocalized  with Lamp1, a lysosomal marker, and Lamp1-positive areas in GRN-deficient (KO)  mice were significantly expanded compared with wild-type (WT) mice after TBI.  Expression of all the lysosome-related genes examined in KO mice was  significantly higher than that in WT mice. The number of activated microglia  with TFEB localized to the nucleus was also significantly increased in KO as  compared with WT mice. Since the TFEB translocation is regulated by the  mammalian target of rapamycin complex 1 (mTORC1) activity in the lysosome, we  compared ribosomal S6 kinase 1 (S6K1) phosphorylation that reflects mTORC1  activity. S6K1 phosphorylation in KO mice was significantly lower than that in  WT mice. In addition, the number of nissl-positive and fluoro-jade B-positive  cells around the injury was significantly decreased and increased, respectively,  in KO as compared with WT mice. These results suggest that PGRN localized in the  lysosome is involved in the activation of mTORC1, and its deficiency leads to  increased TFEB nuclear translocation with a resultant increase in lysosomal  biogenesis in activated microglia and exacerbated neuronal damage in the  cerebral cortex after TBI.', 'Progranulin is a growth factor involved in the regulation of multiple processes  including tumorigenesis, wound repair, development, and inflammation. The recent  discovery that mutations in the gene encoding for progranulin (GRN) cause  frontotemporal lobar degeneration (FTLD), and other neurodegenerative diseases  leading to dementia, has brought renewed interest in progranulin and its  functions in the central nervous system. GRN null mutations cause protein  haploinsufficiency, leading to a significant decrease in progranulin levels that  can be detected in plasma, serum and cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) of mutation  carriers. The dosage of circulating progranulin sped up the identification of  GRN mutations thus favoring genotype-phenotype correlation studies. Researchers  demonstrated that, in GRN null mutation carriers, the shortage of progranulin  invariably precedes clinical symptoms and thus mutation carriers are ""captured""  regardless of their disease status. GRN is a particularly appealing gene for  drug targeting, in the way that boosting its expression may be beneficial for  mutation carriers, preventing or delaying the onset of GRN-related  neurodegenerative diseases. Physiological regulation of progranulin expression  level is only partially known. Progranulin expression reflects mutation status  and, intriguingly, its levels can be modulated by some additional factor (i.e.  genetic background; drugs). Thus, factors increasing the production and  secretion of progranulin from the normal gene are promising potential  therapeutic avenues. In conclusion, peripheral progranulin is a nonintrusive  highly accurate biomarker for early identification of mutation carriers and for  monitoring future treatments that might boost the level of this protein.', 'The Grg gene encodes a 197-amino-acid protein homologous to the amino-terminal  domain of the product of the groucho gene of the Drosophila Enhancer of split  complex. We describe here the genomic organization of the mouse Grg gene. It  spans approximately 7 kb on chromosome 10 and consists of seven exons. The 3\'  region of the Grg gene contains two functional polyadenylation sites that give  rise to two transcripts that are differentially expressed among adult mouse  tissues. The promoter region is very GC rich and lacks TATA box and ""initiator""  sequences. Primer extension analysis and ribonuclease protection assays show  that Grg has a major transcription start site situated down-stream of putative  binding motifs for the transcription factors Sp1, E2A, and PuF.', ""BACKGROUND: Progranulin protein (PGRN) is a cysteine-rich growth factor encoded  by the progranulin gene (GRN). PGRN mutations were identified in patients with  frontotemporal lobar degeneration (FTLD) and recently its role as risk factor  has been described in patients with probable Alzheimer's disease (AD). To date,  more than 100 genetic variants in GRN gene have been described and the  pathogenic nature is still unclear for almost 36% of them. OBJECTIVE: Here, we describe three clinical cases carrying the PGRN variation  Cys139Arg in order to increase the knowledge on the association of this variant  to the clinical spectrum of FTLD. METHODS: The genetic analysis was performed using high resolution melting  analysis. The Human Progranulin ELISA Kit was used in order to determine PGRN  expression levels in the plasma samples. RESULTS: The three patients carrying the genetic variation showed three final  different clinical diagnosis, respectively behavioral frontotemporal dementia,  semantic dementia, and corticobasal syndrome, thus underlining the clinical  heterogeneity typically associated with GRN mutations. All cases shared similar  plasma PGRN levels that resulted intermediate between those measured in controls  and in GRN null mutation carriers, showing a partial reduction of the protein in  plasma. Moreover, according to the bioinformatics software, the Cys139Arg  variation causes a decreased stability of the structure of the protein. CONCLUSION: We describe three new patients affected by neurological syndromes  included in the clinical spectrum of FTLD carrying the Cys139Arg genetic  variant, thus suggesting a possible implication in the pathogenesis of FTLD.""]","Loss-of-function mutations in the gene encoding for the protein progranulin (PGRN), GRN, are one of the major genetic abnormalities involved in frontotemporal lobar degeneration."
97,Which growth factors are known to be involved in the induction of EMT?,"['BACKGROUND: Epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT) is a crucial process in  cancer progression that provides cancer cells with the ability to escape from  the primary focus, invade stromal tissues and migrate to distant regions. Cell  lines that lack E-cadherin show increased tumorigenesis and metastasis, and the  expression levels of E-cadherin and Snail correlate inversely with the prognosis  of patients suffering from breast cancer or oral squamous cell carcinoma (OSCC).  Moreover, recent studies have shown that most EMT cases are regulated by soluble  growth factors or cytokines. Among these factors, fibroblast growth factors  (FGFs) execute diverse functions by binding to and activating members of the FGF  receptor (FGFR) family, including FGFR1-4. Fibroblast growth factor receptor 1  is an oncoprotein that is involved in tumorigenesis, and PD173074 is known to be  a selective inhibitor of FGFR1. However, the roles of FGFR1 and FGFR1 inhibitors  have not yet been examined in detail. METHODS: Here, we investigated the expression of FGFR1 in head and neck squamous  cell carcinoma (HNSCC) and the role of the FGFR1 inhibitor PD173074 in  carcinogenesis and the EMT process. RESULTS: Fibroblast growth factor receptor 1 was highly expressed in 54% of  HNSCC cases and was significantly correlated with malignant behaviours. Nuclear  FGFR1 expression was also observed and correlated well with histological  differentiation, the pattern of invasion and abundant nuclear polymorphism.  Fibroblast growth factor receptor 1 was also overexpressed in EMT cell lines  compared with non-EMT cell lines. Furthermore, treatment of HOC313 cells with  PD173074 suppressed cellular proliferation and invasion and reduced ERK1/2 and  p38 activation. These cells also demonstrated morphological changes,  transforming from spindle- to cobble stone-like in shape. In addition, the  expression levels of certain matrix metalloproteinases (MMPs), whose genes  contain activator protein-1 (AP-1) promoter sites, as well as Snail1 and Snail2  were reduced following PD173074 treatment. CONCLUSION: Taken together, these data suggest that PD173074 inhibits the MAPK  pathway, which regulates the activity of AP-1 and induces MET. Furthermore, this  induction of MET likely suppresses cancer cell growth and invasion.', 'BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: Hypoxia is a hallmark of solid cancers and associated  with metastases and treatment failure. During tumor progression epithelial cells  often acquire mesenchymal features, a phenomenon known as  epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition (EMT). Intratumoral hypoxia has been linked  to EMT induction. We hypothesized that signals from the tumor microenvironment  such as growth factors and tumor oxygenation collaborate to promote EMT and  thereby contribute to radioresistance. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Gene expression changes under hypoxia were analyzed using  microarray and validated by qRT-PCR. Conversion of epithelial phenotype upon  hypoxic exposure, TGFβ addition or oncogene activation was investigated by  Western blot and immunofluorescence. Cell survival following ionizing radiation  was assayed using clonogenic survival. RESULTS: Upon hypoxia, TGFβ addition or EGFRvIII expression, MCF7, A549 and  NMuMG epithelial cells acquired a spindle shape and lost cell-cell contacts.  Expression of epithelial markers such as E-cadherin decreased, whereas  mesenchymal markers such as vimentin and N-cadherin increased. Combining hypoxia  with TGFβ or EGFRvIII expression, lead to more rapid and pronounced EMT-like  phenotype. Interestingly, E-cadherin expression and the mesenchymal appearance  were reversible upon reoxygenation. Mesenchymal conversion and E-cadherin loss  were associated with radioresistance. CONCLUSIONS: Our findings describe a mechanism by which the tumor  microenvironment may contribute to tumor radioresistance via E-cadherin loss and  EMT.', 'Epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT) is believed to play an important role in  fibrosis and tumor invasion. EMT can be induced in vitro cell culture by various  stimuli including growth factors and matrix metalloproteinases. In this study,  we report that cytomix (a mixture of IL-1beta, TNF-alpha and IFN-gamma)  significantly enhances TGF-beta1-induced EMT in A549 cells as evidenced by  acquisition of fibroblast-like cell shape, loss of E-cadherin, and  reorganization of F-actin. IL-1beta or TNF-alpha alone can also augment  TGF-beta1-induced EMT. However, a combination of IL-1beta and TNF-alpha or the  cytomix is more potent to induce EMT. Cytomix, but not individual cytokine of  IL-1beta, TNF-alpha or IFN-gamma, significantly up-regulates expression of  TGF-beta receptor type I (TbetaR-I). Suppression of TbetaR-I, Smad2 or Smad3 by  siRNA partially blocks EMT induction by cytomix plus TGF-beta1, indicating  cytomix augments TGF-beta1-induced EMT through enhancing TbetaR-I and Smad  signaling. These results indicate that inflammatory cytokines together with  TGF-beta1 may play an important role in the development of fibrosis and tumor  progress via the mechanism of epithelial-mesenchymal transition.', 'Tumors are cellularly and molecularly heterogeneous, with subsets of  undifferentiated cancer cells exhibiting stem cell-like features (CSCs).  Epithelial to mesenchymal transitions (EMT) are transdifferentiation programs  that are required for tissue morphogenesis during embryonic development. The EMT  process can be regulated by a diverse array of cytokines and growth factors,  such as transforming growth factor (TGF)-beta, whose activities are dysregulated  during malignant tumor progression. Thus, EMT induction in cancer cells results  in the acquisition of invasive and metastatic properties. Recent reports  indicate that the emergence of CSCs occurs in part as a result of EMT, for  example, through cues from tumor stromal components. Recent evidence now  indicates that EMT of tumor cells not only causes increased metastasis, but also  contributes to drug resistance. In this review, we will provide potential  mechanistic explanations for the association between EMT induction and the  emergence of CSCs. We will also highlight recent studies implicating the  function of TGF-beta-regulated noncoding RNAs in driving EMT and promoting CSC  self-renewal. Finally we will discuss how EMT and CSCs may contribute to drug  resistance, as well as therapeutic strategies to overcome this clinically.', 'The NBT-II rat carcinoma cell line exhibits two mutually exclusive responses to  FGF-1 and EGF, entering mitosis at cell confluency while undergoing an  epithelium-to-mesenchyme transition (EMT) when cultured at subconfluency. EMT is  characterized by acquisition of cell motility, modifications of cell morphology,  and cell dissociation correlating with the loss of desmosomes from cellular  cortex. The pleiotropic effects of EGF and FGF-1 on NBT-II cells suggest that  multiple signaling pathways may be activated. We demonstrate here that growth  factor activation is linked to at least two intracellular signaling pathways.  One pathway leading to EMT involves an early and sustained stimulation of  pp60c-src kinase activity, which is not observed during the growth  factor-induced entry into the cell cycle. Overexpression of normal c-src causes  a subpopulation of cells to undergo spontaneous EMT and sensitizes the rest of  the population to the scattering activity of EGF and FGF-1 without affecting  their mitogenic responsiveness. Addition of cholera toxin, a cAMP-elevating  agent, severely perturbs growth factor induction of EMT without altering  pp60c-src activation, therefore demonstrating that cAMP blockade takes place  downstream or independently of pp60c-src. On the other hand, overexpression of a  mutated, constitutively activated form of pp60c-src does not block cell  dispersion while strongly inhibiting growth factor-induced entry into cell  division. Moreover, stable transfection of a dominant negative mutant of c-src  inhibits the scattering response without affecting mitogenesis induced by the  growth factors. Altogether, these results suggest a role for pp60c-src in  epithelial cell scattering and indicate that pp60c-src might contribute  unequally to the two separate biological activities engendered by a single  signal.', 'Hepatocyte growth factor (HGF) is up-regulated in tissue repair and has been  implicated in playing a role in this process through its anti-apoptotic and  proliferative activities. Cyclooxygenase-2 (COX-2) is an inducible enzyme in the  biosynthetic pathway of prostaglandins, and its activation has been shown to  play an important role in cell growth. We previously reported that HGF  significantly inhibited anoikis, possibly through the up-regulation of COX-2  expression in the endometrial RL95-2 cancer cell line. Here, we report that i)  treatment of RL95-2 cells with HGF resulted in phosphorylation of the HGF  receptor c-Met, activation of Akt and IκB, translocation of NF-κB into the  nucleus, and up-regulation of COX-2 mRNA; ii) the IκB-α phosphorylation  inhibitor BAY11-7082 and the selective COX-2 inhibitor CAY10452 blocked  HGF-mediated anoikis resistance in RL95-2 cells; and iii) HGF induced migration  and invasion in RL95-2 cells, while the phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase (PI3K)  inhibitor LY294002 and CAY10452 blocked these effects of HGF stimulation. Our  data suggest that HGF possesses chemotactic ability, has anti-apoptosis action,  and induces cellular infiltration via the PI3K/Akt pathway; it also triggers  NF-κB activation and up-regulates COX-2 gene expression in endometrial cancer  cells.', 'BACKGROUND: Chemotaxis is defined as directional cell movement of cells towards  concentration gradients of solubilized attractants, whereas chemokinesis is  defined as random cell movement in the absence of chemoattractant gradients.  Since tumor cell motility plays an important role in the process of tumor  invasion and metastasis, we investigated these two distinct motile behaviors in  highly invasive tumor, malignant mesothelioma. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Chemotaxis and chemokinesis of mesothelioma cells were  assayed using Boyden chambers fitted with filters coated with collagen type IV  and different growth factors and cytokines were used as chemoattractants. RESULTS: We found that growth factors such as epidermal growth factor,  transforming growth factor-alpha, amphiregulin, heparin-binding epidermal growth  factor-like growth factor, beta-cellulin, insulin-like growth factor-I,  insulin-like growth factor-II and stem cell factor stimulated directional  (chemotactic) and/or random (chemokinetic) motility in all mesothelioma cell  lines tested, whereas none of acidic fibroblast growth factor, basic fibroblast  growth factor, granulocyte-macrophage colony-stimulating factor or interleukin-6  induced migration in the same mesothelioma cells. CONCLUSION: These findings provide evidence that: (i) multiple growth factors  can induce chemotaxis and chemokinesis in malignant mesothelioma cell lines, and  (ii) may contribute to our understanding of the highly invasive behavior of  malignant mesotheliomas in vivo.', 'Anchorage-independent survival and growth are critical characteristics of  malignant cells. We showed previously that the addition of exogenous hepatocyte  growth factor (HGF) and the presence of fibronectin fibrils stimulate  anchorage-independent colony growth of a murine mammary carcinoma, SP1, which  expresses both HGF and HGF receptor (Met; R. Saulnier et al., Exp. Cell Res.,  222: 360-369, 1996). We now show that tyrosine phosphorylation of Met in  carcinoma cells is augmented by cell adhesion and spreading on fibronectin  substratum. In contrast, detached serum-starved cells exhibit reduced tyrosine  phosphorylation of Met and undergo apoptotic cell death within 18-24 h. Under  these conditions, the addition of HGF stimulates tyrosine phosphorylation of Met  and restores survival of carcinoma cells. Soluble fibronectin also stimulates  cell survival and shows a cooperative survival response with HGF but does not  affect tyrosine phosphorylation of Met; these results indicate that fibronectin  acts via a pathway independent of Met in detached cells. We demonstrated  previously that inhibition of phosphatidylinositol (PI) 3-kinase activity blocks  HGF-induced DNA synthesis of carcinoma cells (N. Rahimi et al., J. Biol. Chem.,  271: 24850-24855, 1996). We now show in detached cells a cooperative effect of  HGF and FN in the activation of PI 3-kinase and on the phosphorylation of  PKB/Akt at serine 473. PI 3-kinase activity is also required for the HGF- and  fibronectin-induced survival responses, as well as anchorage-independent colony  growth. However, c-Src kinase or MEK1/2 activities are not required for the cell  survival effect. Together, these results demonstrate that the PI 3-kinase/Akt  pathway is a key effector of the HGF- and fibronectin-induced survival response  of breast carcinoma cells under detached conditions and corroborate an  interaction between integrin and HGF/ Met signalling pathways in the development  of invasive breast cancer.', 'Multistep carcinogenesis involves more than six discrete events also important  in normal development and cell behavior. Of these, local invasion and metastasis  cause most cancer deaths but are the least well understood molecularly. We  employed a combined in vitro/in vivo carcinogenesis model, that is, polarized  Ha-Ras-transformed mammary epithelial cells (EpRas), to dissect the role of Ras  downstream signaling pathways in epithelial cell plasticity, tumorigenesis, and  metastasis. Ha-Ras cooperates with transforming growth factor beta (TGFbeta) to  cause epithelial mesenchymal transition (EMT) characterized by spindle-like cell  morphology, loss of epithelial markers, and induction of mesenchymal markers.  EMT requires continuous TGFbeta receptor (TGFbeta-R) and oncogenic Ras signaling  and is stabilized by autocrine TGFbeta production. In contrast, fibroblast  growth factors, hepatocyte growth factor/scatter factor, or TGFbeta alone induce  scattering, a spindle-like cell phenotype fully reversible after factor  withdrawal, which does not involve sustained marker changes. Using specific  inhibitors and effector-specific Ras mutants, we show that a hyperactive  Raf/mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) is required for EMT, whereas  activation of phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase (PI3K) causes scattering and  protects from TGFbeta-induced apoptosis. Hyperactivation of the PI3K pathway or  the Raf/MAPK pathway are sufficient for tumorigenesis, whereas EMT in vivo and  metastasis required a hyperactive Raf/MAPK pathway. Thus, EMT seems to be a  close in vitro correlate of metastasis, both requiring synergism between  TGFbeta-R and Raf/MAPK signaling.', 'BACKGROUND: Metastatic castration-resistant prostate cancer (mCRPC) is one of  the main contributors to the death of prostate cancer patients. To date, the  detailed molecular mechanisms underlying mCRPC are unclear. Given the crucial  role of epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT) in cancer metastasis, we aimed  to analyse the expression and function of Transforming growth factor-beta  (TGF-β) signal-associated protein named Sox5 in mCRPC. METHODS: The protein expression levels were analysed by western blot,  immunohistochemistry and immunofluorescence. Luciferase reporter assays and  chromatin immunoprecipitation were employed to validate the target of Sox5. The  effect of Smad3/Sox5/Twist1 on PCa progression was investigated in vitro and in  vivo. RESULTS: Here, we found that TGF-β-induced EMT was accompanied by increased Sox5  expression. Interestingly, knockdown of Sox5 expression attenuated EMT induced  by TGF-β signalling. Furthermore, we demonstrated that Smad3 could bind to the  promoter of Sox5 and regulate its expression. Mechanistically, Sox5 could bind  to Twist1 promoter and active Twist1, which initiated EMT. Importantly,  knockdown of Sox5 in prostate cancer cells resulted in less of the mesenchymal  phenotype and cell migration ability. Furthermore, targeting Sox5 could inhibit  prostate cancer progression in a xenograft mouse model. In clinic, patients with  high Sox5 expression were more likely to suffer from metastases, and high Sox5  expression also has a lower progression-free survival and cancer  specific-survival in clinic database. CONCLUSIONS: Therefore, we propose a new mechanism in which Smad3/Sox5/Twist1  promotes EMT and contributes to PCa progression.']","EMT is characterized by acquisition of cell motility, modifications of cell morphology, and cell dissociation correlating with the loss of desmosomes from the cellular cortex.

98,Can ATAC-Seq be employed in single-cell mode?,"['ATAC-seq is a recently developed method to identify the areas of open chromatin  in a cell. These regions usually correspond to active regulatory elements and  their location profile is unique to a given cell type. When done at single-cell  resolution, ATAC-seq provides an insight into the cell-to-cell variability that  emerges from otherwise identical DNA sequences by identifying the variability in  the genomic location of open chromatin sites in each of the cells. This paper  presents Scasat (single-cell ATAC-seq analysis tool), a complete pipeline to  process scATAC-seq data with simple steps. Scasat treats the data as binary and  applies statistical methods that are especially suitable for binary data. The  pipeline is developed in a Jupyter notebook environment that holds the  executable code along with the necessary description and results. It is robust,  flexible, interactive and easy to extend. Within Scasat we developed a novel  differential accessibility analysis method based on information gain to identify  the peaks that are unique to a cell. The results from Scasat showed that open  chromatin locations corresponding to potential regulatory elements can account  for cellular heterogeneity and can identify regulatory regions that separates  cells from a complex population.', 'Most genomes to date have been sequenced without taking into account the diploid  nature of the genome. However, the distribution of variants on each individual  chromosome can (1) significantly impact gene regulation and protein function,  (2) have important implications for analyses of population history and medical  genetics, and (3) be of great value for accurate interpretation of medically  relevant genetic variation. Here, we describe a comprehensive and detailed  protocol for an ultra fast (<3 h library preparation), cost-effective, and  scalable haplotyping method, named Contiguity Preserving Transposition  sequencing or CPT-seq (Amini et al., Nat Genet 46(12):1343-1349, 2014). CPT-seq  accurately phases >95 % of the whole human genome in Mb-scale phasing blocks.  Additionally, the same workflow can be used to aid de novo assembly (Adey et  al., Genome Res 24(12):2041-2049, 2014), detect structural variants, and perform  single cell ATAC-seq analysis (Cusanovich et al., Science 348(6237):910-914,  2015).', 'The assay for transposase-accessible chromatin using sequencing (ATAC-seq) is  widely used to identify regulatory regions throughout the genome. However, very  few studies have been performed at the single cell level (scATAC-seq) due to  technical challenges. Here we developed a simple and robust plate-based  scATAC-seq method, combining upfront bulk Tn5 tagging with single-nuclei  sorting. We demonstrate that our method works robustly across various systems,  including fresh and cryopreserved cells from primary tissues. By profiling over  3000 splenocytes, we identify distinct immune cell types and reveal cell  type-specific regulatory regions and related transcription factors.', 'Here we present a comprehensive map of the accessible chromatin landscape of the  mouse hippocampus at single-cell resolution. Substantial advances of this work  include the optimization of a single-cell combinatorial indexing assay for  transposase accessible chromatin (sci-ATAC-seq); a software suite, scitools, for  the rapid processing and visualization of single-cell combinatorial indexing  data sets; and a valuable resource of hippocampal regulatory networks at  single-cell resolution. We used sci-ATAC-seq to produce 2346 high-quality  single-cell chromatin accessibility maps with a mean unique read count per cell  of 29,201 from both fresh and frozen hippocampi, observing little difference in  accessibility patterns between the preparations. By using this data set, we  identified eight distinct major clusters of cells representing both neuronal and  nonneuronal cell types and characterized the driving regulatory factors and  differentially accessible loci that define each cluster. Within pyramidal  neurons, we identified four major clusters, including CA1 and CA3 neurons, and  three additional subclusters. We then applied a recently described  coaccessibility framework, Cicero, which identified 146,818 links between  promoters and putative distal regulatory DNA. Identified coaccessibility  networks showed cell-type specificity, shedding light on key dynamic loci that  reconfigure to specify hippocampal cell lineages. Lastly, we performed an  additional sci-ATAC-seq preparation from cultured hippocampal neurons (899  high-quality cells, 43,532 mean unique reads) that revealed substantial  alterations in their epigenetic landscape compared with nuclei from hippocampal  tissue. This data set and accompanying analysis tools provide a new resource  that can guide subsequent studies of the hippocampus.', 'Author information: (1)Program in Epithelial Biology, Stanford University School of Medicine,  Stanford, CA 94305, USA.

Electronic address: khavari@stanford.edu.', 'Conventional high-throughput genomic technologies for mapping regulatory element  activities in bulk samples such as ChIP-seq, DNase-seq and FAIRE-seq cannot  analyze samples with small numbers of cells. The recently developed low-input  and single-cell regulome mapping technologies such as ATAC-seq and single-cell  ATAC-seq (scATAC-seq) allow analyses of small-cell-number and single-cell  samples, but their signals remain highly discrete or noisy. Compared to these  regulome mapping technologies, transcriptome profiling by RNA-seq is more widely  used. Transcriptome data in single-cell and small-cell-number samples are more  continuous and often less noisy. Here, we show that one can globally predict  chromatin accessibility and infer regulatory element activities using RNA-seq.  Genome-wide chromatin accessibility predicted by RNA-seq from 30 cells can offer  better accuracy than ATAC-seq from 500 cells. Predictions based on single-cell  RNA-seq (scRNA-seq) can more accurately reconstruct bulk chromatin accessibility  than using scATAC-seq. Integrating ATAC-seq with predictions from RNA-seq  increases the power and value of both methods. Thus, transcriptome-based  prediction provides a new tool for decoding gene regulatory circuitry in samples  with limited cell numbers.', 'The regulatory mechanisms that ensure an accurate control of gene transcription  are central to cellular function, development and disease. Such mechanisms rely  largely on noncoding regulatory sequences that allow the establishment and  maintenance of cell identity and tissue-specific cellular functions.The study of  chromatin structure and nucleosome positioning allowed revealing transcription  factor accessible genomic sites with regulatory potential, facilitating the  comprehension of tissue-specific cis-regulatory networks. Recently a new  technique coupled with high-throughput sequencing named Assay for Transposase  Accessible Chromatin (ATAC-seq) emerged as an efficient method to chart open  chromatin genome wide. The application of such technique to different cell types  allowed unmasking tissue-specific regulatory elements and characterizing  cis-regulatory networks. Herein we describe the implementation of the ATAC-seq  method to human pancreatic islets, a tissue playing a central role in the  control of glucose metabolism.', 'Enhancers are cis-acting sequences that regulate transcription rates of their  target genes in a cell-specific manner and harbor disease-associated sequence  variants in cognate cell types. Many complex diseases are associated with  enhancer malfunction, necessitating the discovery and study of enhancers from  clinical samples. Assay for Transposase Accessible Chromatin (ATAC-seq)  technology can interrogate chromatin accessibility from small cell numbers and  facilitate studying enhancers in pathologies. However, on average, ~35% of open  chromatin regions (OCRs) from ATAC-seq samples map to enhancers. We developed a  neural network-based model, Predicting Enhancers from ATAC-Seq data (PEAS), to  effectively infer enhancers from clinical ATAC-seq samples by extracting  ATAC-seq data features and integrating these with sequence-related features  (e.g., GC ratio). PEAS recapitulated ChromHMM-defined enhancers in CD14+  monocytes, CD4+ T cells, GM12878, peripheral blood mononuclear cells, and  pancreatic islets. PEAS models trained on these 5 cell types effectively  predicted enhancers in four cell types that are not used in model training  (EndoC-βH1, naïve CD8+ T, MCF7, and K562 cells). Finally, PEAS inferred  individual-specific enhancers from 19 islet ATAC-seq samples and revealed  variability in enhancer activity across individuals, including those driven by  genetic differences. PEAS is an easy-to-use tool developed to study enhancers in  pathologies by taking advantage of the increasing number of clinical epigenomes.', 'Gaining insights into the regulatory mechanisms that underlie the  transcriptional variation observed between individual cells necessitates the  development of methods that measure chromatin organization in single cells. Here  I adapted Nucleosome Occupancy and Methylome-sequencing (NOMe-seq) to measure  chromatin accessibility and endogenous DNA methylation in single cells  (scNOMe-seq). scNOMe-seq recovered characteristic accessibility and DNA  methylation patterns at DNase hypersensitive sites (DHSs). An advantage of  scNOMe-seq is that sequencing reads are sampled independently of the  accessibility measurement. scNOMe-seq therefore controlled for fragment loss,  which enabled direct estimation of the fraction of accessible DHSs within  individual cells. In addition, scNOMe-seq provided high resolution of chromatin  accessibility within individual loci which was exploited to detect footprints of  CTCF binding events and to estimate the average nucleosome phasing distances in  single cells. scNOMe-seq is therefore well-suited to characterize the chromatin  organization of single cells in heterogeneous cellular mixtures.', 'For this special issue of J. R. Soc. Interface we present an overview of the  driving forces behind technological advances in the field of single-cell  analysis. These range from increasing our understanding of cellular  heterogeneity through to the study of rare cells, areas of research that cannot  be tackled effectively using current high-throughput population-based averaging  techniques.']",Single-cell ATAC-seq detects open chromatin in individual cells.
99,What is Neisseria adhesin A?,"['Serogroup B meningococcal (MenB) disease remains a serious public health problem  for which a cross-protective vaccine effective against a wide range of MenB  isolates has not been available. Novartis Vaccines has developed a vaccine for  the prevention of MenB disease that contains four antigenic components: factor H  binding protein (fHbp), neisserial adhesin A (NadA), Neisseria heparin binding  antigen (NHBA) and outer membrane vesicles from a New Zealand epidemic strain  (which provides PorA). This vaccine has been submitted for regulatory review in  Europe so it is timely to review the design of the vaccine, results to date in  clinical studies and the potential strain coverage provided by the vaccine. It  is also critical to discuss the key issues for the long-term success of the  vaccine which include strain coverage, potential persistence of protection,  potential effects on carriage of MenB strains, potential for escape mutants and  cost effectiveness.', 'The poor immunogenicity of the meningococcal serogroup B (MenB) capsule has led  to the development of vaccines targeting subcapsular antigens, in particular the  immunodominant and diverse outer membrane porin, PorA. These vaccines are  largely strain specific; however, they offer limited protection against the  diverse MenB-associated diseases observed in many industrialized nations. To  broaden the scope of its protection, the multicomponent vaccine (4CMenB)  incorporates a PorA-containing outer membrane vesicle (OMV) alongside relatively  conserved recombinant protein components, including factor H-binding protein  (fHbp), Neisseria adhesin A (NadA), and neisserial heparin-binding antigen  (NHBA). The expression of PorA is unique to meningococci (Neisseria  meningitidis); however, many subcapsular antigens are shared with nonpathogenic  members of the genus Neisseria that also inhabit the nasopharynx. These  organisms may elicit cross-protective immunity against meningococci and/or  occupy a niche that might otherwise accommodate pathogens. The potential for  4CMenB responses to impact such species (and vice versa) was investigated by  determining the genetic distribution of the primary 4CMenB antigens among  diverse members of the common childhood commensal, Neisseria lactamica. All the  isolates possessed nhba but were devoid of fhbp and nadA. The nhba alleles were  mainly distinct from but closely related to those observed among a  representative panel of invasive MenB isolates from the same broad geographic  region. We made similar findings for the immunogenic typing antigen, FetA, which  constitutes a major part of the 4CMenB OMV. Thus, 4CMenB vaccine responses may  impact or be impacted by nasopharyngeal carriage of commensal neisseriae. This  highlights an area for further research and surveillance should the vaccine be  routinely implemented.', 'Neisseria meningitidis adhesin A (NadA) is a meningococcus surface protein  thought to assist in the adhesion of the bacterium to host cells. We have  previously shown that NadA also promotes bacterial internalization in a  heterologous expression system. Here we have used the soluble recombinant NadA  (rNadA) lacking the membrane anchor region to characterize its internalization  route in Chang epithelial cells. Added to the culture medium, rNadA internalizes  through a PI3K-dependent endocytosis process not mediated by the canonical  clathrin or caveolin scaffolds, but instead follows an ARF6-regulated recycling  pathway previously described for MHC-I. The intracellular pool of rNadA reaches  a steady state level within one hour of incubation and colocalizes in endocytic  vesicles with MHC-I and with the extracellularly labeled chaperone Hsp90.  Treatment with membrane permeated and impermeable Hsp90 inhibitors 17-AAG and  FITC-GA respectively, lead to intracellular accumulation of rNadA, strongly  suggesting that the extracellular secreted pool of the chaperone is involved in  rNadA intracellular trafficking. A significant number of intracellular vesicles  containing rNadA recruit Rab11, a small GTPase associated to recycling  endosomes, but do not contain transferrin receptor (TfR). Interestingly, cell  treatment with Hsp90 inhibitors, including the membrane-impermeable FITC-GA,  abolished Rab11-rNadA colocalization but do not interfere with Rab11-TfR  colocalization. Collectively, these results are consistent with a model whereby  rNadA internalizes into human epithelial cells hijacking the recycling endosome  pathway and recycle back to the surface of the cell via an ARF6-dependent, Rab11  associated and Hsp90-regulated mechanism. The present study addresses for the  first time a meningoccoccal adhesin mechanism of endocytosis and suggests a  possible entry pathway engaged by N. meningitidis in primary infection of human  epithelial cells.', 'Neisseria adhesin A (NadA), involved in the adhesion and invasion of Neisseria  meningitidis into host tissues, is one of the major components of Bexsero, a  novel multicomponent vaccine licensed for protection against meningococcal  serogroup B in Europe, Australia, and Canada. NadA has been identified in  approximately 30% of clinical isolates and in a much lower proportion of carrier  isolates. Three protein variants were originally identified in invasive  meningococci and named NadA-1, NadA-2, and NadA-3, whereas most carrier isolates  either lacked the gene or harbored a different variant, NadA-4. Further analysis  of isolates belonging to the sequence type 213 (ST-213) clonal complex  identified NadA-5, which was structurally similar to NadA-4, but more distantly  related to NadA-1, -2, and -3. At the time of this writing, more than 89  distinct nadA allele sequences and 43 distinct peptides have been described.  Here, we present a revised nomenclature system, taking into account the complete  data set, which is compatible with previous classification schemes and is  expandable. The main features of this new scheme include (i) the grouping of the  previously named NadA-2 and NadA-3 variants into a single NadA-2/3 variant, (ii)  the grouping of the previously assigned NadA-4 and NadA-5 variants into a single  NadA-4/5 variant, (iii) the introduction of an additional variant (NadA-6), and  (iv) the classification of the variants into two main groups, named groups I and  II. To facilitate querying of the sequences and submission of new allele  sequences, the nucleotide and amino acid sequences are available at  http://pubmlst.org/neisseria/NadA/.', 'With the aim of studying the molecular diversity of the antigens of a new  recombinant vaccine against meningococcus serogroup B, the three genes coding  for the main vaccine components GNA (Genome-derived Neisseria Antigen) 1870  (fHbp, factor H Binding Protein), GNA1994 (NadA, Neisseria adhesin A) and  GNA2132 were sequenced in a panel of 85 strains collected worldwide and selected  as representative of the serogroup B meningococcal diversity. No correlations  were found between vaccine antigen variability and serogroup, geographic area  and year of isolation. Although a relevant clustering was found with MLST clonal  complexes, each showing an almost specific antigen variant repertoire, the  prediction of the antigen assortment was not possible on the basis of MLST  alone. Therefore, classification of meningococcus on the basis of MLST only is  not sufficient to predict vaccine antigens diversity. Sequencing each gene in  the different strains will be important to evaluate antigen conservation and  assortment and to allow a future prediction of potential vaccine coverage.', 'Surface-expressed protein antigens such as factor H-binding protein (fHbp),  Neisserial adhesin A (NadA), Neisserial heparin-binding antigen (NHBA) and Porin  protein A (PorA); all express sequence variability that can affect their  function as protective immunogens when used in meningococcal serogroup B  vaccines like the recently-approved 4CMenB (Bexsero(®)). We assessed the  sequence variation of genes coding for these proteins and two additional  proteins (""fusion partners"" to fHbp and NHBA) in pathogenic isolates from a  recent low incidence period (endemic situation; 2005-2006) in Norway. Findings  among strains from this panel were contrasted to what was found among isolates  from a historic outbreak (epidemic situation; 1985-1990). Multilocus sequence  typing revealed 14 clonal complexes (cc) among the 66 endemic strains, while  cc32 vastly predominated in the 38-strain epidemic panel. Serogroup B isolates  accounted for 50/66 among endemic strains and 28/38 among epidemic strains.  Potential strain-coverage (""sequence match"") for the 4CMenB vaccine was  identified among the majority (>70%) of the endemic serogroup B isolates and all  of the epidemic serogroup B isolates evaluated. Further information about the  degree of expression, surface availability and the true cross-reactivity for the  vaccine antigens will be needed to fully characterize the clinical  strain-coverage of 4CMenB in various geographic and epidemiological situations.', 'The poor immunogenicity of the meningococcal serogroup B (MenB) capsule has led  to the development of vaccines targeting subcapsular antigens, in particular the  immunodominant and diverse outer membrane porin, PorA.

We studied 123 S. epidermidis strains from infections  related to orthopedic implants, as regards their ability to express a factor of  virulence, namely the slime, an extracellular polysaccharide, which mediates  adherence to implants and bacterial colonization. The slime-producing ability  was determined by PCR detection of icaA and icaD genes responsible for slime  synthesis, and by culture on Congo red agar plates in which slime-producing  strains form black colonies, while nonslime-forming ones develop red colonies.  56% of the S. epidermidis isolates were icaA- icaD-positive and grew to become  black colonies. In the evaluation of the distribution of slime-forming strains  in different sites and types of implants, we found a slight, but not  statistically significant, increase in slime-forming strains in total joint  prostheses, where tissue compression near the articular faces can form niches in  which bacteria crowd, sheltered by the slime. Our findings confirm the role of  ica genes as a virulence marker in the pathogenesis of implant-associated  orthopedic infections. However, they do not show the existence of a higher  frequency of slime-positive strains in a specific type of implant.', 'The physico-chemical characterization of NadADelta(351-405), a recombinant  protein discovered by reverse vaccinology, component of a candidate vaccine  against Neisseria meningitidis serotype B is presented. Analytical methods like  mass spectrometry, electrophoresis, optical spectroscopy and SEC-MALLS have been  applied to unveil the structure of NadADelta(351-405), and to evaluate  Product-Related Substances. Moreover, analysis of the protein after intentional  denaturation has been applied in order to challenge the chosen methods and to  determine their appropriateness and specificity. All the obtained results were  inserted in a model allowing in-depth understanding of the antigen  NadADelta(351-405): it is present in solution as a homo-trimer, retaining a high  percentage of alpha-helix secondary structure, and able to reassemble from  monomeric subunits after thermal denaturation; this structural organization is  consistent with that foreseen for MenB NadA (Neisseria Adhesin A). The  analytical data sets produced during process development for clinical phases  I-III material confirm product quality and manufacturing consistency.', 'BACKGROUND: A novel meningococcal multicomponent vaccine, 4CMenB (Bexsero®), has  been approved in Europe, Canada, Australia and US. The potential impact of  4CMenB on strain coverage is being estimated by using Meningococcal Antigen  Typing System (MATS), an ELISA assay which measures vaccine antigen expression  and diversity in each strain. Here we show the genetic characterization and the  4CMenB potential coverage of Spanish invasive strains (collected during one  epidemiological year) compared to other European countries and discuss the  potential reasons for the lower estimate of coverage in Spain. MATERIAL AND METHODS: A panel of 300 strains, a representative sample of all  serogroup B Neisseria meningitidis notified cases in Spain from 2009 to 2010,  was characterized by multilocus sequence typing (MLST) and FetA variable region  determination. 4CMenB vaccine antigens, PorA, factor H binding protein (fHbp),  Neisseria Heparin Binding Antigen (NHBA) and Neisserial adhesin A (NadA) were  molecularly typed by sequencing. PorA coverage was assigned to strain with VR2 =  4. The levels of expression and cross-reactivity of fHbp, NHBA and NadA were  analyzed using MATS ELISA. FINDINGS: Global estimated strain coverage by MATS was 68.67% (95% CI:  47.77-84.59%), with 51.33%, 15.33% and 2% of strains covered by one, two and  three vaccine antigens, respectively. The predicted strain coverage by  individual antigens was: 42% NHBA, 36.33% fHbp, 8.33% PorA and 1.33% NadA.  Coverage within the most prevalent clonal complexes (cc) was 70.37% for cc 269,  30.19% for cc 213 and 95.83% for cc 32. CONCLUSIONS: Clonal complexes (cc) distribution accounts for variations in  strain coverage, so that country-by-country investigations of strain coverage  and cc prevalence are important. Because the cc distribution could also vary  over time, which in turn could lead to changes in strain coverage, continuous  detailed surveillance and monitoring of vaccine antigens expression is needed in  those countries where the multicomponent vaccine is introduced. This is really  important in countries like Spain where most of the strains are predicted to be  covered by only one vaccine antigen and the chance for escape mutants to emerge  with vaccine use is higher. Based on the observed data, cc213 should receive  special attention as it is associated with low predicted strain coverage, and  has recently emerged in Spain.']","Neisseria adhesin A (NadA) is one of the antigens of Bexsero, the recently licensed multicomponent vaccine against serogroup B Neisseria meningitidis (MenB).

As a vaccine antigen, NadA has been shown to induce high levels of bactericidal antibodies. More than 89 distinct NadA allele sequences and 43 distinct peptides have been described."
100,What is targeted by Pexidartinib?,"['Pexidartinib (TURALIO™) is an orally administered small molecule tyrosine kinase  inhibitor with selective activity against the colony-stimulating factor 1 (CSF1)  receptor, KIT proto-oncogene receptor tyrosine kinase (KIT) and FMS-like  tyrosine kinase 3 harboring an internal tandem duplication mutation (FLT3-ITD).  In August 2019, the US FDA approved pexidartinib capsules for the treatment of  adult patients with symptomatic tenosynovial giant cell tumor (TGCT) associated  with severe morbidity or functional limitations and not amenable to improvement  with surgery. This approval was based on positive results from the phase III  ENLIVEN trial. Pexidartinib is being investigated in various malignancies as  monotherapy or combination therapy. This article summarizes the milestones in  the development of pexidartinib leading to its first approval for TGCT.', 'New immunotherapeutic strategies are needed to induce effective antitumor  immunity in all cancer patients. Malignant mesothelioma is characterized by a  poor prognosis and resistance to conventional therapies. Infiltration of  tumor-associated macrophages (TAM) is prominent in mesothelioma and is linked to  immune suppression, angiogenesis, and tumor aggressiveness. Therefore, TAM  depletion could potentially reactivate antitumor immunity. We show that M-CSFR  inhibition using the CSF-1R kinase inhibitor PLX3397 (pexidartinib) effectively  reduced numbers of TAMs, circulating nonclassical monocytes, as well as amount  of neoangiogenesis and ascites in mesothelioma mouse models, but did not improve  survival. When combined with dendritic cell vaccination, survival was  synergistically enhanced with a concomitant decrease in TAMs and an increase in  CD8+ T-cell numbers and functionality. Total as well as tumor antigen-specific  CD8+ T cells in tumor tissue of mice treated with combination therapy showed  reduced surface expression of the programmed cell death protein-1 (PD-1), a  phenomenon associated with T-cell exhaustion. Finally, mice treated with  combination therapy were protected from tumor rechallenge and displayed superior  T-cell memory responses. We report that decreasing local TAM-mediated immune  suppression without immune activation does not improve survival. However,  combination of TAM-mediated immune suppression with dendritic cell immunotherapy  generates robust and durable antitumor immunity. These findings provide insights  into the interaction between immunotherapy-induced antitumor T cells and TAMs  and offer a therapeutic strategy for mesothelioma treatment.

Colony-stimulating factor 1  (CSF1) controls macrophage differentiation, and here we sought to determine the  effect of a CSF1 receptor inhibitor, PLX3397, on adipose tissue macrophage  levels and understand the impact on glucose homeostasis in mice. METHODS: A Ten-week-old mice were fed a chow or high-fat diet for 10 weeks and  then treated with PLX3397 via oral gavage (50\u2009mg/kg) every second day for 3  weeks, with subsequent monitoring of glucose tolerance, insulin sensitivity and  assessment of adipose tissue immune cells. RESULTS: PLX3397 treatment substantially reduced macrophage numbers in adipose  tissue of both chow and high-fat diet fed mice without affecting total myeloid  cell levels. Despite this, PLX3397 did not greatly alter glucose homeostasis,  did not affect high-fat diet-induced increases in visceral fat cytokine  expression (Il-6 and Tnfa) and had limited effect on the phosphorylation of the  stress kinases JNK and ERK and macrophage polarization. CONCLUSIONS: Our results indicate that macrophage infiltration of adipose tissue  induced by a high-fat diet may not be the trigger for impairments in whole body  glucose homeostasis, and that anti-CSF1 therapies are not likely to be useful as  treatments for insulin resistance.', 'PURPOSE: To evaluate the safety, recommended phase\u2009II dose (RP2D) and efficacy  of pexidartinib, a colony stimulating factor receptor\u20091 (CSF-1R) inhibitor, in  combination with weekly paclitaxel in patients with advanced solid tumors. PATIENTS AND METHODS: In part 1 of this phase Ib study, 24 patients with  advanced solid tumors received escalating doses of pexidartinib with weekly  paclitaxel (80\u2009mg/m2). Pexidartinib was administered at 600\u2009mg/day in cohort\u20091.  For subsequent cohorts, the dose was increased by ⩽50% using a standard 3+3  design. In part 2, 30 patients with metastatic solid tumors were enrolled to  examine safety, tolerability and efficacy of the RP2D. Pharmacokinetics and  biomarkers were also assessed. RESULTS: A total of 51 patients reported ≥1 adverse event(s) (AEs) that were at  least possibly related to either study drug. Grade\u20093-4 AEs, including anemia  (26%), neutropenia (22%), lymphopenia (19%), fatigue (15%), and hypertension  (11%), were recorded in 38 patients (70%). In part 1, no maximum tolerated dose  was achieved and 1600\u2009mg/day was determined to be the RP2D. Of 38 patients  evaluable for efficacy, 1 (3%) had complete response, 5 (13%) partial response,  13 (34%) stable disease, and 17 (45%) progressive disease. No drug-drug  interactions were found. Plasma CSF-1 levels increased 1.6- to 53-fold, and  CD14dim/CD16+ monocyte levels decreased by 57-100%. CONCLUSIONS: The combination of pexidartinib and paclitaxel was generally well  tolerated. RP2D for pexidartinib was 1600\u2009mg/day. Pexidartinib blocked CSF-1R  signaling, indicating potential for mitigating macrophage tumor infiltration.', ""Huntington's disease is associated with a reactive microglial response and  consequent inflammation. To address the role of these cells in disease  pathogenesis, we depleted microglia from R6/2 mice, a rapidly progressing model  of Huntington's disease marked by behavioural impairment, mutant huntingtin  (mHTT) accumulation, and early death, through colony-stimulating factor 1  receptor inhibition (CSF1Ri) with pexidartinib (PLX3397) for the duration of  disease. Although we observed an interferon gene signature in addition to  downregulated neuritogenic and synaptic gene pathways with disease, overt  inflammation was not evident by microglial morphology or cytokine transcript  levels in R6/2 mice. Nonetheless, CSF1Ri-induced microglial elimination reduced  or prevented disease-related grip strength and object recognition deficits, mHTT  accumulation, astrogliosis, and striatal volume loss, the latter of which was  not associated with reductions in cell number but with the extracellular  accumulation of chondroitin sulphate proteoglycans (CSPGs)-a primary component  of glial scars. A concurrent loss of proteoglycan-containing perineuronal nets  was also evident in R6/2 mice, and microglial elimination not only prevented  this but also strikingly increased perineuronal nets in the brains of naïve  littermates, suggesting a new role for microglia as homeostatic regulators of  perineuronal net formation and integrity."", 'Somatic mutations of calreticulin (CALR) have been identified as a main disease  driver of myeloproliferative neoplasms, suggesting that development of drugs  targeting mutant CALR is of great significance. Site-directed mutagenesis in the  N-glycan binding domain (GBD) abolishes the ability of mutant CALR to  oncogenically activate the thrombopoietin receptor (MPL). We therefore  hypothesized that a small molecule targeting the GBD might inhibit the  oncogenicity of the mutant CALR. Using an in silico molecular docking study, we  identified candidate binders to the GBD of CALR. Further experimental validation  of the hits identified a group of catechols inducing a selective growth  inhibitory effect on cells that depend on oncogenic CALR for survival and  proliferation. Apoptosis-inducing effects by the compound were significantly  higher in the CALR-mutated cells than in CALR wild-type cells. Additionally,  knockout or C-terminal truncation of CALR eliminated drug hypersensitivity in  CALR-mutated cells. We experimentally confirmed the direct binding of the  selected compound to CALR, disruption of the mutant CALR-MPL interaction,  inhibition of the JAK2-STAT5 pathway, and reduction at the intracellular level  of mutant CALR upon drug treatment. Our data indicate that small molecules  targeting the GBD of CALR can selectively kill CALR-mutated cells by disrupting  the CALR-MPL interaction and inhibiting oncogenic signaling.', 'Kusunokinin, a lignan compound, inhibits cancer cell proliferation and induces  apoptosis; however, the role of kusunokinin is not fully understood. Here, we  aimed to identify a target protein of (-)-kusunokinin and determine the protein  levels of its downstream molecules. We found that (-)-kusunokinin bound 5  possible target proteins, including CSF1R, MMP-12, HSP90-α, CyclinB1 and MEK1  with ΔGbind less than -10.40 kcal/mol. MD simulation indicated (-)-kusunokinin  and pexidartinib (P31, a specific CSF1R binding compound) shared some extents of  functional similarity in which (-)-kusunokinin bound CSF1R at the juxtamembrane  (JM) region with aromatic amino acids similar to pexidartinib using π-π  interaction, as well as hydrogen bond. Both P31 and (-)-kusunokinin moved into  the same CSF1R region and W7 was a mutual key residue. However, the P31 binding  site differed from the (-)-kusunokinin binding site. For in vitro study, the  synthetic (±)-kusunokinin exhibited stronger cytotoxicity than  picropodophyllotoxin, silibinin and etoposide on MCF-7 cells and represented  less toxicity than picropodophyllotoxin and doxorubicin on L-929 and MCF-12A  cells. Knocking down CSF1R using a specific siRNA combination with  (±)-kusunokinin demonstrated levels of cell proliferation proteins slightly  higher than siRNA-CSF1R treatment. However, siRNA-CSF1R combination with P31  represented the number of cell viability and cell proliferation proteins, like  in the control groups (Lipofectamine and siRNA-Luciferase). Moreover,  (±)-kusunokinin suppressed CSF1R and its downstream proteins, including AKT,  CyclinD1 and CDK1. Meanwhile, both P31 and siRNA-CSF1R dramatically suppressed  CSF1R, MEK1, AKT, ERK, CyclinB1, CyclinD1 and CDK1. Our overall results indicate  that the mechanism of (±)-kusunokinin differed fairly from P31. We have  concluded that (±)-kusunokinin inhibited breast cancer cell proliferation  partially through the binding and suppression of CSF1R, which consequently  affected AKT and its downstream molecules.', 'BACKGROUND: One of the most successful approaches to develop new small molecule  therapeutics has been to start from a validated druggable protein target.  However, only a small subset of potentially druggable targets has attracted  significant research and development resources. The Illuminating the Druggable  Genome (IDG) project develops resources to catalyze the development of likely  targetable, yet currently understudied prospective drug targets. A central  component of the IDG program is a comprehensive knowledge resource of the  druggable genome. RESULTS: As part of that effort, we have developed a framework to integrate,  navigate, and analyze drug discovery data based on formalized and standardized  classifications and annotations of druggable protein targets, the Drug Target  Ontology (DTO). DTO was constructed by extensive curation and consolidation of  various resources. DTO classifies the four major drug target protein families,  GPCRs, kinases, ion channels and nuclear receptors, based on phylogenecity,  function, target development level, disease association, tissue expression,  chemical ligand and substrate characteristics, and target-family specific  characteristics. The formal ontology was built using a new software tool to  auto-generate most axioms from a database while supporting manual knowledge  acquisition. A modular, hierarchical implementation facilitate ontology  development and maintenance and makes use of various external ontologies, thus  integrating the DTO into the ecosystem of biomedical ontologies. As a formal  OWL-DL ontology, DTO contains asserted and inferred axioms. Modeling data from  the Library of Integrated Network-based Cellular Signatures (LINCS) program  illustrates the potential of DTO for contextual data integration and nuanced  definition of important drug target characteristics. DTO has been implemented in  the IDG user interface Portal, Pharos and the TIN-X explorer of protein target  disease relationships. CONCLUSIONS: DTO was built based on the need for a formal semantic model for  druggable targets including various related information such as protein, gene,  protein domain, protein structure, binding site, small molecule drug, mechanism  of action, protein tissue localization, disease association, and many other  types of information. DTO will further facilitate the otherwise challenging  integration and formal linking to biological assays, phenotypes, disease models,  drug poly-pharmacology, binding kinetics and many other processes, functions and  qualities that are at the core of drug discovery. The first version of DTO is  publically available via the website http://drugtargetontology.org/ , Github (  http://github.com/DrugTargetOntology/DTO ), and the NCBO Bioportal (  http://bioportal.bioontology.org/ontologies/DTO ). The long-term goal of DTO is  to provide such an integrative framework and to populate the ontology with this  information as a community resource.', 'PURPOSE OF REVIEW: The molecular target of rapamycin, which is a member of the  phosphoinositide 3-kinase related kinase family and a central modulator of cell  growth, is a unique and prime strategic target for anticancer therapeutic  development. RECENT FINDINGS: The molecular target of rapamycin plays a critical role in  transducing proliferative signals mediated through the phosphatidylinositol 3  kinase and protein kinase B signaling pathways, principally by activating  downstream protein kinases that are required for both ribosomal biosynthesis and  translation of mRNAs of proteins that are essential for G1 to S phase traverse.  By targeting the molecular target of rapamycin with high potency and  specificity, the immunosuppressant and antiproliferative agent rapamycin  inhibits signals required for cell cycle progression, cell growth, and  proliferation. Both rapamycin and several rapamycin analogs with more favorable  pharmaceutical properties have demonstrated impressive growth inhibitory effects  against a broad range of human cancers in both preclinical and early clinical  evaluations. SUMMARY: This review discusses recent findings regarding the principal  mechanisms of action of the rapamycins, the potential utility of these agents as  anticancer therapeutics, clinical results to date, and developmental challenges  that lie ahead.', 'KRAS is one of the most common human oncogenes, but concerted efforts to produce  direct inhibitors have largely failed, earning KRAS the title of ""undruggable"".  Recent efforts to produce subtype specific inhibitors have been more successful,  and several KRASG12C inhibitors have reached clinical trials, including  adagrasib and sotorasib, which have shown early evidence of efficacy in  patients. Lessons from other inhibitors of the RAS pathway suggest that the  effect of these drugs will be limited in vivo by the development of drug  resistance, and pre-clinical studies of G12C inhibitors have identified evidence  of this. In this review we discuss the current evidence for G12C inhibitors, the  mechanisms of resistance to G12C inhibitors and potential approaches to overcome  them. We discuss possible targets of combination therapy, including SHP2,  receptor tyrosine kinases, downstream effectors and PD1/PDL1, and review the  ongoing clinical trials investigating these inhibitors.']",Pexidartinib is a selective tyrosine kinase inhibitor against CSF1R.
101,Which are the methods for in silico prediction of the origin of replication (ori) among bacteria?,"['Genome replication is a crucial and essential process for the continuity of  life.In all organisms it starts at a specific region of the genome known as  origin of replication (Ori) site. The number of Ori sites varies in prokaryotes  and eukaryotes. Replication starts at a single Ori site in bacteria, but in  eukaryotes multiple Ori sites are used for fast copying across all chromosomes.  The situation becomes complex in archaea, where some groups have single and  others have multiple origins of replication. Themococcales, are a  hyperthermophilic order of archaea. They are anaerobes and heterotrophs-peptide  fermenters, sulphate reducers, methanogens being some of the examples of  metabolic types. In this paper we have applied a combination of multiple in  silico approaches - Z curve, the cell division cycle (cdc6) gene location and  location of consensus origin recognition box (ORB) sequences for location of  origin of replication in Thermococcus onnurineus, Thermococcus gammatolerans and  other Themococcales and compared the results to that of the well-documented case  of Pyrococcus abyssi. The motivation behind this study is to find the number of  Ori sites based on the data available for members of this order. Results from  this in silico analysis show that the Themococcales have a single origin of  replication.', 'Replication of chromosomes is one of the central events in the cell cycle.  Chromosome replication begins at specific sites, called origins of replication  (oriCs), for all three domains of life. However, the origins of replication  still remain unknown in a considerably large number of bacterial and archaeal  genomes completely sequenced so far. The availability of increasing complete  bacterial and archaeal genomes has created challenges and opportunities for  identification of their oriCs in silico, as well as in vivo. Based on the  Z-curve theory, we have developed a web-based system Ori-Finder to predict oriCs  in bacterial genomes with high accuracy and reliability by taking advantage of  comparative genomics, and the predicted oriC regions have been organized into an  online database DoriC, which is publicly available at  http://tubic.tju.edu.cn/doric/ since 2007. Five years after we constructed  DoriC, the database has significant advances over the number of bacterial  genomes, increasing about 4-fold. Additionally, oriC regions in archaeal genomes  identified by in vivo experiments, as well as in silico analyses, have also been  added to the database. Consequently, the latest release of DoriC contains oriCs  for >1500 bacterial genomes and 81 archaeal genomes, respectively.', 'BACKGROUND: Chromosomal replication is the central event in the bacterial cell  cycle. Identification of replication origins (oriCs) is necessary for almost all  newly sequenced bacterial genomes. Given the increasing pace of genome  sequencing, the current available software for predicting oriCs, however, still  leaves much to be desired. Therefore, the increasing availability of genome  sequences calls for improved software to identify oriCs in newly sequenced and  unannotated bacterial genomes. RESULTS: We have developed Ori-Finder, an online system for finding oriCs in  bacterial genomes based on an integrated method comprising the analysis of base  composition asymmetry using the Z-curve method, distribution of DnaA boxes, and  the occurrence of genes frequently close to oriCs. The program can also deal  with unannotated genome sequences by integrating the gene-finding program ZCURVE  1.02. Output of the predicted results is exported to an HTML report, which  offers convenient views on the results in both graphical and tabular formats. CONCLUSION: A web-based system to predict replication origins of bacterial  genomes has been presented here. Based on this system, oriC regions have been  predicted for the bacterial genomes available in GenBank currently. It is hoped  that Ori-Finder will become a useful tool for the identification and analysis of  oriCs in both bacterial and archaeal genomes.', 'BACKGROUND: Chromosomal DNA replication in bacteria starts at the origin (ori)  and the two replicores propagate in opposite directions up to the terminus (ter)  region. We hypothesize that the two replicores need to reach ter at the same  time to maintain a physical balance; DNA insertion would disrupt such a balance,  requiring chromosomal rearrangements to restore the balance. To test this  hypothesis, we needed to demonstrate that ori and ter are in a physical balance  in bacterial chromosomes. Using wavelet analysis, we documented GC skew, AT  skew, purine excess and keto excess on the published bacterial genomic sequences  to locate the turning (minimum and maximum) points on the curves. Previously,  the minimum point had been supposed to correlate with ori and the maximum to  correlate with ter. RESULTS: We observed a strong tendency of the bacterial chromosomes towards a  physical balance, with the minima and maxima corresponding to the known or  putative ori and ter and being about half chromosome separated in most of the  bacteria studied. A nonparametric method based on wavelet transformation was  employed to perform significance tests for the predicted loci. CONCLUSIONS: The wavelet approach can reliably predict the ori and ter regions  and the bacterial chromosomes have a strong tendency towards a physical balance  between ori and ter.', 'The key protein in the initiation of Helicobacter pylori chromosome replication,  DnaA, has been characterized. The amount of the DnaA protein was estimated to be  approximately 3000 molecules per single cell; a large part of the protein was  found in the inner membrane. The H.pylori DnaA protein has been analysed using  in vitro (gel retardation assay and surface plasmon resonance (SPR)) as well as  in silico (comparative computer modeling) studies. DnaA binds a single DnaA box  as a monomer, while binding to the fragment containing several DnaA box motifs,  the oriC region, leads to the formation of high molecular mass nucleoprotein  complexes. In comparison with the Escherichia coli DnaA, the H.pylori DnaA  protein exhibits lower DNA-binding specificity; however, it prefers oriC over  non-box DNA fragments. As determined by gel retardation techniques, the H.pylori  DnaA binds with a moderate level of affinity to its origin of replication (4nM).  Comparative computer modelling showed that there are nine residues within the  binding domain which are possible determinants of the reduced H.pylori DnaA  specificity. Of these, the most interesting is probably the triad PTL; all three  residues show significant divergence from the consensus, and Thr398 is the most  divergent residue of all.', 'In bacterial chromosomes, the position of a gene relative to the single origin  of replication generally reflects its replication timing, how often it is  expressed, and consequently, its rate of evolution. However, because some  archaeal genomes contain multiple origins of replication, bias in gene dosage  caused by delayed replication should be minimized and hence the substitution  rate of genes should associate less with chromosome position. To test this  hypothesis, six archaeal genomes from the genus Sulfolobus containing three  origins of replication were selected, conserved orthologs were identified, and  the evolutionary rates (dN and dS) of these orthologs were quantified. Ortholog  families were grouped by their consensus position and designated by their  proximity to one of the three origins (O1, O2, O3). Conserved orthologs were  concentrated near the origins and most variation in genome content occurred  distant from the origins. Linear regressions of both synonymous and  nonsynonymous substitution rates on distance from replication origins were  significantly positive, the rates being greatest in the region furthest from any  of the origins and slowest among genes near the origins. Genes near O1 also  evolved faster than those near O2 and O3, which suggest that this origin may  fire later in the cell cycle. Increased evolutionary rates and gene  dispensability are strongly associated with reduced gene expression caused in  part by reduced gene dosage during the cell cycle. Therefore, in this genus of  Archaea as well as in many Bacteria, evolutionary rates and variation in genome  content associate with replication timing.', 'The genomic sequence of the halophilic archaeon Halobacterium NRC-1 has been  analyzed by the Z curve method. The Z curve is a three-dimensional curve that  uniquely represents a given DNA sequence. Based on the known behaviors of the Z  curves for the archaea whose replication origins have been identified, the  analysis of the Z curve for the genome of Halobacterium NRC-1 strongly suggests  that the large genome has two replication origins, oriC1 (921,863-922,014) and  oriC2 (1,806,444-1,807,229), which are located at two sharp peaks of the Z  curve. These two regions are next to the cdc6 genes and contain multiple copies  of stretches of G and C, i.e., ggggtgggg and ccccacccc, which may also be  regarded as direct and inverted repeats. Based on the above analysis, a model of  replication of Halobacterium NRC-1 with two replication origins and two termini  has been proposed. The experimental confirmation of this model would constitute  the first example of multiple replication origins of archaea, which will finally  provide much insight into the understanding of replication mechanisms of  eukaryotic organisms, including human. In addition, the potential multiple  replication origins of the archaeon Sulfolobus solfataricus are suggested by the  analysis based on the Z curve method.', 'The performance of gene-predicting tools varies considerably if evaluated with  respect to the parameters sensitivity and specificity or their capability to  identify the correct start codon. We were interested to validate tools for gene  prediction and to implement a metatool named YACOP, which combines existing  tools and has a higher performance. YACOP parses and combines the output of the  three gene-predicting systems Criticia, Glimmer and ZCURVE. It outperforms each  of the programs tested with its high sensitivity and specificity values combined  with a larger number of correctly predicted gene starts. Performance of YACOP  and the gene-finding programs was tested by comparing their output with a  carefully selected set of annotated genomes. We found that the problem of  identifying genes in prokaryotic genomes by means of computational analysis was  solved satisfactorily. In contrast, the correct localization of the start codon  still appeared to be a problem, as in all cases under test at least 7.8% and up  to 32.3% of the positions given in the annotations differed from the locus  predicted by any of the programs tested. YACOP can be downloaded from  http://www.g2l.bio.uni-goettingen.de.', 'Replication origins were mapped in hyperthermophilic crenarchaea, using  high-throughput sequencing-based marker frequency analysis. We confirm previous  origin mapping in Sulfolobus acidocaldarius, and demonstrate that the single  chromosome of Pyrobaculum calidifontis contains four replication origins, the  highest number detected in a prokaryotic organism. The relative positions of the  origins in both organisms coincided with regions enriched in highly conserved  (core) archaeal genes. We show that core gene distribution provides a useful  tool for origin identification in archaea, and predict multiple replication  origins in a range of species. One of the P. calidifontis origins was mapped in  detail, and electrophoretic mobility shift assays demonstrated binding of the  Cdc6/Orc1 replication initiator protein to a repeated sequence element, denoted  Orb-1, within the origin. The high-throughput sequencing approach also allowed  for an annotation update of both genomes, resulting in the restoration of open  reading frames encoding proteins involved in, e.g., sugar, nitrate and energy  metabolism, as well as in glycosylation and DNA repair.', 'In bacterial cells, bidirectional replication of the circular chromosome is  initiated from a single origin (oriC) and terminates in an antipodal terminus  region such that movement of the pair of replication forks is largely  codirectional with transcription. The terminus region is flanked by discrete Ter  sequences that act as polar, or direction-dependent, arrest sites for fork  progression. Alternative oriC-independent modes of replication initiation are  possible, one of which is constitutive stable DNA replication (cSDR) from  transcription-associated RNA-DNA hybrids or R-loops. Here, I discuss the  distinctive attributes of fork progression and termination associated with  different modes of bacterial replication initiation. Two hypothetical models are  proposed: that head-on collisions between pairs of replication forks, which are  a feature of replication termination in all kingdoms of life, provoke bilateral  fork reversal reactions; and that cSDR is characterized by existence of distinct  subpopulations in bacterial cultures and a widespread distribution of origins in  the genome, each with a small firing potential. Since R-loops are known to exist  in eukaryotic cells and to inflict genome damage in G1 phase, it is possible  that cSDR-like events promote aberrant replication initiation even in  eukaryotes.']","Several in silico methods have been applied for prediction of the origin of replication (ori). DNA base composition asymmetry, such as GC skew, is the basis of numerous in silico methods used to detect the ori in prokaryotes. The Z curve analysis is also used for ori identification. Comparative genomics, by BLAST analyses of the intergenic sequences compared to related species have been applied in ori prediction. The finding of the dnaA gene and its binding sites, DnaA boxes, as well as the finding of the binding sites of other proteins, such as CtrA and IHF, are fundamental characteristics used for in silico prediction of the ori. Also, the localization of boundary genes, such as cell division cycle (cdc6) gene, and consensus origin recognition box (ORB) sequences have been employed for ori detection. The study of the gene order around the origin sequence and the distribution of the genes encoded in the leading versus the lagging strand are also used for in silico detection of the ori."
102,Is treatment with Bacillus Calmette Guerin used for bladder cancer?,"['INTRODUCTION: Bacillus Calmette-Guerin (BCG) is a live attenuated strain of  Mycobacterium bovis that has been used to treat urothelial carcinoma since 1976,  and has been reported to eradicate disease in more than 70% of patients with in  situ and stage I disease. To the best of our knowledge, we report the first case  of disseminated bacillus Calmette-Guerin infection causing multiple abscesses  affecting the pancreatic head and right psoas muscle, diagnosed 5 years after  intravesical treatment with bacillus Calmette-Guerin therapy for bladder cancer. CASE PRESENTATION: An 83-year-old Caucasian man was hospitalized with a 2-month  history of back pain, anorexia, generalized weakness and a 47-pound weight loss.  He had previously undergone two transurethral resections for high-grade  transitional cell carcinoma of the bladder and had received 12 intravesical  bacillus Calmette-Guerin instillations without any complications. He complained  of abdominal pain in his right flank. A computed tomography scan of the abdomen  showed multiple abscesses affecting the pancreatic head and right psoas muscle.  Growth of Mycobacterium bovis was determined in cultures of the purulent  material obtained by surgical drainage of the abscesses. CONCLUSIONS: This case illustrates the fact that although intravesical  administration of bacillus Calmette-Guerin is generally considered to be safe,  it is not exempt from complications and these could appear immediately after  treatment or as a delayed complication many years later.', 'Despite effective treatment of existing tumors, patients with bladder cancer  remain at risk of developing new tumors. Effective immunotherapy may lower that  risk. To test this hypothesis, mice that had survived transitional cell  carcinoma (MBT2) transplantation with the aid of bacillus Calmette-Guerin  immunotherapy were randomized and tested for long term protective immunity  against bladder carcinoma. Fifty-one tumor-free mice that had survived tumor  challenge 10 to 15 months previously were randomized into 3 groups to receive  intradermal tumor .noculation and intraperitoneal levamisole, intralesional Tice  strain bacillus Calmette-Guerin, or intralesional saline. Fifteen previously  unchallenged animals also received tumor and intralesional saline. All 3 groups  of survivors had less tumor growth (p less than 0.01) than nonsurviving  controls. Even among survivors, additional bacillus Calmette-Guerin  immunization, but not levamisole treatment, significantly inhibited tumor growth  (p less than 0.01). A 2nd experiment compared 22 nonimmune mice, 21 mice  preimmunized intravenously with 300 micrograms of bacillus Calmette-Guerin cell  walls, and 18 mice that had survived MBT2 by 8 months after live bacillus  Calmette-Guerin treatment. Nonimmune and survivor groups were randomly  subdivided into saline or treatment groups. Cell wall-preimmunized mice were  divided into matching groups according to footpad response to purified protein  derivative. The cell-wall preimmunized and nonimmune mice received the  immunostimulant P3+Re-glycolipid or the carrier solution alone. The group of  survivors received either intralesional saline or live bacillus Calmette-Guerin.  Both bacillus Calmette-Guerin and saline-treated groups had significantly less  tumor growth (p less than 0.001) than nonsurviving controls. Animals treated  with P3-Re-glycolipid (with or without preimmunization with cell wall) did not  differ from nonsurviving control. Footpad response to purified protein  derivative did not correlate with tumor growth in these mice. Our results  suggest that intralesional bacillus Calmette-Guerin immunotherapy can afford  long term protection from transplanted bladder cancer, and that live bacillus  Calmette-Guerin is superior to levamisole and P3 + Re-glycolipid + bacillus  Calmette-Guerin cell walls in the treatment of bladder cancer.', ""PURPOSE: The identification of factors predicting the outcome of stage T1  high-grade bladder cancer (BC) is a major clinical issue. METHODS: We performed immunohistochemistry to assess the role of human epidermal  growth factor receptor-2 (HER-2) and microsatellite instability (MSI) factors  MutL homologue 1 (MLH1) and MutS homologue 2 (MSH2) in predicting recurrence and  progression of T1 high-grade BCs having undergone transurethral resection of  bladder tumor (TURBT) alone or TURBT\u2009+\u2009intravesical instillations of bacillus  Calmette-Guerin (BCG). RESULTS: HER-2 overexpression was a significant predictor of disease-free  survival (DFS) in the overall as well as in the two patients' population; as for  progression-free survival (PFS), it was significant in the overall but not in  the two patients' population. MLH1 was an independent predictor of PFS only in  patients treated with BCG and MSH2 failed to predict DFS and PFS in all  populations. Most importantly, the higher the number of altered markers the  lowers the DFS and PFS. In multivariate Cox proportional-hazards regression  analysis, the number of altered molecular markers and BCG treatment were  significant predictors (p\u2009=\u20090.0004 and 0.0283, respectively) of DFS, whereas the  number of altered molecular markers was the only significant predictor  (p\u2009=\u20090.0054) of PFS. CONCLUSIONS: Altered expression of the proto-oncogene HER-2 and the two  molecular markers of genetic instability MLH1 and MSH2 predicted T1 high-grade  BC outcome with the higher the number of altered markers the lower the DFS and  PFS. These findings provide grounds for further testing them in predicting the  outcome of this challenging disease."", 'PURPOSE: Up to 90% of patients with high grade superficial bladder tumors  experience tumor recurrence and up to 50% have progression despite bacillus  Calmette-Guerin treatment. Natural killer cells have a major role in the  mechanism of the response to bacillus Calmette-Guerin but the exact mechanisms  are still elusive. The recently discovered natural cytotoxicity receptors are  linked to the host response to viral infection and to cancer. We tested the  hypothesis that tumor expression of natural cytotoxicity receptor ligands can  serve as a predictive factor for the response to intravesical bacillus  Calmette-Guerin in patients with nonmuscle invasive, high grade bladder cancer. MATERIALS AND METHODS: We developed a histochemical staining method for analysis  of the ligands of the 3 known natural cytotoxicity receptors NKp30, NKp44 and  NKp46 using genetically engineered fusion proteins and an automated image  analysis system. We examined formalin fixed, paraffin embedded sections of  specimens of transurethral bladder tumor resection from patients with primary,  nonmuscle invasive, high grade bladder cancer who were subsequently treated with  bacillus Calmette-Guerin. We compared natural cytotoxicity receptor ligand  expression to the response to bacillus Calmette-Guerin immunotherapy. RESULTS: Six of 17 patients (35%) had recurrence despite bacillus  Calmette-Guerin treatment. Primary tumors from favorably responding patients  expressed higher levels of ligands for all 3 fusion proteins (NKp30, NKp44 and  NKp46 p = 0.0026, 0.027 and 0.044, respectively). CONCLUSIONS: Bacillus Calmette-Guerin resistant, high grade, nonmuscle invasive  bladder tumors express significantly lower levels of ligands of all 3 natural  cytotoxicity receptors compared with bacillus Calmette-Guerin responsive tumors.  This suggests that down-regulation of these ligands facilitates escape from the  bacillus Calmette-Guerin effect. Furthermore, analysis of ligand expression,  which can be performed on formalin fixed, paraffin embedded sections, may serve  as a new predictive assay for the response to bacillus Calmette-Guerin.', 'Local immunotherapy with bacillus Calmette-Guerin (BCG) is an effective and  frequently used treatment for superficial bladder cancer.

We describe a 53 year- old man  with a disseminated bacillus Calmette-Guerin (BCG) infection after intravescical  instillation for bladder carcinoma. Recent literature is reviewed for this rare  complication.', 'Bacillus Calmette-Guérin (BCG) immunotherapy for bladder cancer has been used  since 1976 when the first evidence of its ability to lower recurrence and  progression rates was published. Today, BCG immunotherapy is the choice of care  for high-grade non-muscle invasive bladder cancer (NMIBC) after transurethral  resection. This article presents indications and procedure of BCG instillations,  and outlines the effects on recurrence and progression of NMIBC. The BCG-induced  immunity in NMIBC is not yet fully understood. Animal studies point towards BCG  inducing specific tumour immunity. We describe the current knowledge of how this  immunity is induced, from internalization of BCG bacilli in urothelial cells, to  cytokine- and chemokine-mediated recruitment of neutrophils, monocytes,  macrophages, T cells, B cells and natural killer cells. In addition, we describe  the process of trained immunity, the non-specific protective effects of BCG.  Recent studies also indicate that dysbiosis of the urinary microbiome may cause  lower urinary tract dysfunction. Side effects of BCG bladder instillations range  from common, mild and transient symptoms, such as dysuria and flu-like symptoms,  to more severe and rarely occurring life-threatening complications. We review  the literature and give an overview of reported incidences and management of BCG  infections after intravesical instillation.', 'The primary role of immunotherapy for bladder cancer is to treat superficial  transitional cell carcinomas (ie, carcinoma in situ, Ta, and T1). Immunotherapy  in the form of bacille Calmette-Guérin (BCG), interferon, bropirimine, keyhole  limpet hemocyanin, and gene therapy is intended to treat existing or residual  tumor, to prevent recurrence of tumor, to prevent progression of disease, and to  prolong survival of patients. Presently, BCG is commonly used and is the most  effective immunotherapeutic agent against superficial transitional cell  carcinoma. Data support that BCG has a positive impact on tumor recurrence,  disease progression, and survival. Proper attention to maintenance schedules,  route of administration, dosing, strains, and viability is essential to obtain  the maximum benefits of BCG immunotherapy. This review highlights and summarizes  the recent advances concerning immunotherapy, with special emphasis on BCG  therapy for transitional cell carcinoma.', 'Bacillus Calmette-Guerin (BCG) is the standard of care for intravesical therapy  for carcinoma in situ and non-muscle invasive, nonmetastatic human urothelial  carcinoma. Although the responsiveness to this immunotherapeutic is believed to  be linked with (i) a high number of somatic mutations and (ii) a large number of  tumor-infiltrating lymphocytes, recent findings of the roles that inhibitory  immune receptors and their ligands play in tumor evasion may provide insights  into the limitations of the effectiveness of BCG and offer new targets for  immune-based therapy. In this study, an aggressive, bioluminescent orthotopic  bladder cancer model, MB49 tumor cells transfected with luciferase (MB49(luc)),  was used to study the antitumor effects of avelumab, an antibody to PD-L1.  MB49(luc) murine tumor cells form multifocal tumors on the mucosal wall of the  bladder reminiscent of non-muscle invasive, nonmetastatic urothelial carcinomas.  MB49(luc) bladder tumors are highly positive for the expression of PD-L1, and  avelumab administration induced significant (P < 0.05) antitumor effects. These  antitumor effects were more dependent on the presence of CD4 than CD8 T cells,  as determined by in vivo immune cell depletions. The findings suggest that in  this bladder tumor model, interruption of the immune-suppressive PD-1/PD-L1  complex releases a local adaptive immune response that, in turn, reduces tumor  growth. This bladder tumor model can be used to further identify host antitumor  immune mechanisms and evaluate combinations of immune-based therapies for  carcinoma in situ and non-muscle invasive, nonmetastatic urothelial carcinoma,  to provide the rationale for subsequent clinical studies.

Recent advances in  our understanding of systemic immunotherapy have transformed the management of  advanced urothelial carcinoma and have led to the development of multiple novel  agents. Using this insight, these agents are now being investigated for use in  NMIBC. RECENT FINDINGS: Although BCG has been used to treat high-risk NMIBC for  decades, new applications of immunotherapy include the use of exogenous  cytokines to boost immune response, vaccines to activate the immune system  against specific tumor-associated antigens, intravesical agents that cause  generalized local inflammation, and targeted antibodies against proteins on the  surface of immune checkpoint inhibitors. Although most of these agents are still  being investigated in clinical trials and are not yet considered standard of  care, they hold significant promise in the treatment of patients with high-risk  NMIBC. SUMMARY: The use of immunotherapy has significantly improved survival outcomes  in advanced urothelial carcinoma. Based on rapid advances in our understanding  of the immune system and tumor biology, these agents are also poised to alter  the therapeutic landscape for NMIBC dramatically as clinical trials are  completed.']",Intravesical Bacillus Calmette-Guerin (BCG) is the best treatment modality for progression of non-muscle invasive bladder cancer.
103,What is the incidence of Edwards syndrom in the european population?,"['OBJECTIVE: To evaluate the efficiency of the second trimester screening for  fetal chromosomal anomaly using maternal serum marker. METHOD: 27,313 pregnant women with the gestational age of 15 - 20 weeks were  selected by stratified combined with cluster sampling from 13 counties over  Jiangsu province and 5 townships, towns, or subdistricts from 6 randomly  selected cities from southern, central, and northern Jiangsu, totally 95  communities, between July 2002 and November 2006. Questionnaire survey was  conducted. Body weight was taken. Ultrasonography was used to confirm the  gestational age. Peripheral blood samples were collected to detect the maternal  serum alpha-fetoprotein (AFP) and free beta human chorionic gonadotrophin  (f-betaHCG). The risk values of Down syndrome and Edwards syndrome were  calculated. The women at high risk of Down syndrome and Edwards syndrome for  their fetuses were recommended to receive genetic counseling and amniocentesis.  All babies were followed up until six months to four years of age after birth. RESULTS: 26,803 of the 27,313 women (98%) were screened. The average was 25.1,  and 1.7% of them were over 35. Serum screening showed that 1,244 (5%) were Down  syndrome positive and 105 (0.4%) were Edwards syndrome positive. The final  pregnant outcomes showed that 20 cases presented chromosomal abnormalities, of  which 9 cases suffered from Down syndrome, 5 cases Edwards syndrome, and 6 cases  other chromosomal abnormalities. The detection rate of Down syndrome and Edwards  syndrome were 56% and 80% respectively. CONCLUSION: Under good quality control high prenatal detection rate of fetal  chromosomal abnormalities can be reached by screening of maternal serum AFP and  f-betaHCG during the second pregnancy trimester. Good cost-effectiveness depends  on the incidence of targeted birth defects.', ""BACKGROUND: Maternal serum triple marker screening (alpha-fetoprotein, human  chorionic gonadotropin, and unconjugated estriol) can detect 60-70% of Down  syndrome and 60% of Edwards syndrome. Previous studies have reported that  positive serum screening is related to other fetal chromosomal abnormalities,  pregnancy complications, and adverse outcomes. We determined the incidence and  karyotype of chromosomal abnormalities in screen positive women and evaluated a  relationship between chromosomal and ultrasonographic abnormalities. METHODS: Of the 49,806 pregnant women between 15 and 23 weeks' gestational age  who received prenatal serum screening with a cut-off value (a risk of 1:270 for  Down and 1:100 for Edwards syndrome), 2,116 (4.2%) and 196 (0.4%) were screen  positive for Down syndrome and for Edwards syndrome, respectively. Chromosomal  analysis in amniotic fluid was performed for 1,893 (89.5%) of the Down positive  and 140 (71.4%) of the Edwards positive pregnant women. Ultrasonographic  examination was performed to detect fetal abnormalities. RESULTS: Eighty-three cases of chromosomal abnormalities including 40 trisomy 21  (2.1%) and 43 other chromosomal abnormalities (2.3%) were identified in the Down  screen positive. Other chromosomal abnormalities included 9 numerical and 34  structural abnormalities. Ten cases of chromosomal abnormalities (9 trisomy 18  and 1 trisomy 9) were detected in the Edwards screen positive. Ultrasonographic  abnormalities were found more frequently in the women who had chromosomal  aberrations. CONCLUSIONS: These data suggest that 4.4% of the Down screen and 7.1% of the  Edwards screen positive pregnancy have fetal chromosomal abnormalities. Positive  Down screening results reflect a relatively high probability of other  abnormalities except trisomy 21. Edwards screen positive group show a low  frequency of other chromosomal abnormalities except trisomy 18. A simultaneous  use of maternal serum screening and ultrasonograms could be useful for the  diagnosis of fetal abnormalities."", 'Oesophageal atresia is a congenital defect of alimentary tract concerning the  interruption of oesophagus with or without connection with the trachea. Its  incidence is 1:3000-3500 of live-born. Associated anomalies including genetic  disorders occur in 50% of patients. Edwards syndrome which is trisomy of  chromosome 18 with poor prognosis. The incidence of Edwards syndrome is 1:5000  of live-born. About 5% of these children live more than 1 year. The aim of this  article is a retrospective analysis of the course of treatment of newborn with  oesophageal atresia and Edwards syndrome and making of therapeutic decision. The  authors from different medical specializations: clinical genetics, paediatric  surgery, paediatrics and neonatology, paediatric intensive care and palliative  medicine, have undertaken a discussion regarding surgical treatment of children  with oesophageal atresia and chromosomal, lethal syndrome.', 'OBJECTIVES: To determine whether older paternal age increases the risk of  fathering a pregnancy with Patau (trisomy 13), Edwards (trisomy 18), Klinefelter  (XXY) or XYY syndrome. DESIGN: Case-control: cases with each of these syndromes were matched to four  controls with Down syndrome from within the same congenital anomaly register and  with maternal age within 6 months. SETTING: Data from 22 EUROCAT congenital anomaly registers in 12 European  countries. PARTICIPANTS: Diagnoses with observed or (for terminations) predicted year of  birth from 1980 to 2005, comprising live births, fetal deaths with gestational  age ≥ 20 weeks and terminations after prenatal diagnosis of the anomaly. Data  include 374 cases of Patau syndrome, 929 of Edwards syndrome, 295 of Klinefelter  syndrome, 28 of XYY syndrome and 5627 controls with Down syndrome. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Odds ratio (OR) associated with a 10-year increase in  paternal age for each anomaly was estimated using conditional logistic  regression. Results were adjusted to take account of the estimated association  of paternal age with Down syndrome (1.11; 95% CI 1.01 to 1.23). RESULTS: The OR for Patau syndrome was 1.10 (95% CI 0.83 to 1.45); for Edwards  syndrome, 1.15 (0.96 to 1.38); for Klinefelter syndrome, 1.35 (1.02 to 1.79);  and for XYY syndrome, 1.99 (0.75 to 5.26). CONCLUSIONS: There was a statistically significant increase in the odds of  Klinefelter syndrome with increasing paternal age. The larger positive  associations of Klinefelter and XYY syndromes with paternal age compared with  Patau and Edwards syndromes are consistent with the greater percentage of these  sex chromosome anomalies being of paternal origin.', 'BACKGROUND: Whilst maternal age is an established risk factor for Patau syndrome  (trisomy 13), Edwards syndrome (trisomy 18) and Down syndrome (trisomy 21), the  aetiology and contribution of genetic and environmental factors remains unclear.  We analysed for space-time clustering using high quality fully population-based  data from a geographically defined region. METHODS: The study included all cases of Patau, Edwards and Down syndrome,  delivered during 1985-2003 and resident in the former Northern Region of  England, including terminations of pregnancy for fetal anomaly. We applied the  K-function test for space-time clustering with fixed thresholds of close in  space and time using residential addresses at time of delivery. The Knox test  was used to indicate the range over which the clustering effect occurred. Tests  were repeated using nearest neighbour (NN) thresholds to adjust for variable  population density. RESULTS: The study analysed 116 cases of Patau syndrome, 240 cases of Edwards  syndrome and 1084 cases of Down syndrome. There was evidence of space-time  clustering for Down syndrome (fixed threshold of close in space: P = 0.01, NN  threshold: P = 0.02), but little or no clustering for Patau (P = 0.57, P = 0.19)  or Edwards (P = 0.37, P = 0.06) syndromes. Clustering of Down syndrome was  associated with cases from more densely populated areas and evidence of  clustering persisted when cases were restricted to maternal age <40 years. CONCLUSIONS: The highly novel space-time clustering for Down syndrome suggests  an aetiological role for transient environmental factors, such as infections.', ""Author information: (1)Genetic Epidemiology Unit, Department of Epidemiology, Erasmus University  Medical Center, Rotterdam, The Netherlands.

(#)Contributed equally"", 'BACKGROUND: The reported prevalence of Alport syndrome varies from one in 5000  to one in 53,000 individuals. This study estimated the frequencies of predicted  pathogenic COL4A3-COL4A5 variants in sequencing databases of populations without  known kidney disease. METHODS: Predicted pathogenic variants were identified using filtering steps  based on the ACMG/AMP criteria, which considered collagen IV α3-α5 position 1  Gly to be critical domains. The population frequencies of predicted pathogenic  COL4A3-COL4A5 variants were then determined per mean number of sequenced  alleles. Population frequencies for compound heterozygous and digenic  combinations were calculated from the results for heterozygous variants. RESULTS: COL4A3-COL4A5 variants resulting in position 1 Gly substitutions were  confirmed to be associated with hematuria (for each, P<0.001). Predicted  pathogenic COL4A5 variants were found in at least one in 2320 individuals.  p.(Gly624Asp) represented nearly half (16 of 33, 48%) of the variants in  Europeans. Most COL4A5 variants (54 of 59, 92%) had a biochemical feature that  potentially mitigated the clinical effect. The predicted pathogenic heterozygous  COL4A3 and COL4A4 variants affected one in 106 of the population, consistent  with the finding of thin basement membrane nephropathy in normal donor kidney  biopsy specimens. Predicted pathogenic compound heterozygous variants occurred  in one in 88,866 individuals, and digenic variants in at least one in 44,793. CONCLUSIONS: The population frequencies for Alport syndrome are suggested by the  frequencies of predicted pathogenic COL4A3-COL4A5 variants, but must be adjusted  for the disease penetrance of individual variants and for the likelihood of  already diagnosed disease and non-Gly substitutions. Disease penetrance may  depend on other genetic and environmental factors.', 'Clinical genomic sequencing can identify pathogenic variants unrelated to the  initial clinical question, but of medical relevance to the patients and their  families. With ongoing discussions on the utility of disclosing or searching for  such variants, it is of crucial importance to obtain unbiased insight in the  prevalence of these incidental or secondary findings, in order to better weigh  potential risks and benefits. Previous studies have reported a broad range of  secondary findings ranging from 1 to 9%, merely attributable to differences in  study design, cohorts tested, sequence technology used and genes analyzed. Here,  we analyzed WES data of 1640 anonymized healthy Dutch individuals to establish  the frequency of medically actionable disease alleles in an outbred population  of European descent. Our study shows that 1 in 38 healthy individuals (2.7%) has  a (likely) pathogenic variant in one of 59 medically actionable dominant disease  genes for which the American College of Medical Genetics and Genomics (ACMG)  recommends disclosure. Additionally, we identified 36 individuals (2.2%) to be a  carrier of a recessive pathogenic disease allele. Whereas these frequencies of  secondary findings are in line with what has been reported in the East-Asian  population, the pathogenic variants are differently distributed across the 59  ACMG genes. Our results contribute to the debate on genetic risk factor  screening in healthy individuals and the discussion whether the potential  benefits of this knowledge and related preventive options, outweigh the risk of  the emotional impact of the test result and possible stigmatization.', 'The incidence of cystic fibrosis (CF) in Finland, 1:25,000 newborn, is one of  the lowest in Caucasian populations. The delta F508 mutation accounts for 18/40  (45%) of CF chromosomes in Finland. Other mutations were therefore sought among  the remaining 55%. Twelve out of 40 chromosomes (30%) were found to carry  394delTT, whereas G542X and 3732delA were each detected in one chromosome. Eight  mutations remained unidentified using a testing panel for 26 mutations. Mutation  394delTT was associated exclusively with haplotype 23-36-13. Five unknown  mutations were associated with different haplotypes for microsatellite markers,  whereas three shared the same haplotype. Most delta F508 mutations and all  unidentified mutations originated from regions of old and dense settlement in  the coastal regions, whereas 394delTT was geographically clustered and enriched  in a rural location, consistent with a local founder effect. The remote location  of Finland and her population history give a plausible explanation for the  rarity of CF in Finland.', 'Cyprus is an island in the eastern Mediterranean basin inhabited by people of  Caucasian extraction, mostly Greek-Cypriots. The most common inherited disease  among Caucasians is cystic fibrosis (CF). Although no careful scientific study  had ever been done the impression was that CF was extremely rare among the  Greek-Cypriots, with an incidence estimated at around 1:30,000. About 2 years  ago, we introduced molecular diagnostic methodology in an effort to assist  clinicians in safer diagnosis of patients presenting with atypical CF  symptomatology, and also for testing the hypothesis that mutations that cause  milder phenotypes might be responsible for misdiagnosis or for missing entirely  some cases of CF. Initial screening for delta F508 revealed that it is indeed  rare in the general population. Further screening of suspected CF patients  revealed a novel mutation that converted leucine at position 346 to proline  (L346P) in two unrelated families. The second CF mutation was delta F508 and  1677delTA in the two families respectively, both reportedly associated with  severe phenotypes. Yet our patients did not present with typical CF pictures  possibly because of the dominant nature of this novel mild mutation in exon 7.  Symptoms included failure to thrive, chest infections and electrolyte  disturbances. These findings raise the possibility that Cyprus might have been  spared very severe CF phenotypes but not cystic fibrosis transmembrane  conductance regulator (CFTR) mutations.']",Between 0.125 and 39 in every 1000 live births.

104,Which drug should be used as an antidote in benzodiazepine overdose?,"['Flumazenil is a recently discovered pharmacologic antagonist of the CNS effects  of benzodiazepines. It acts by binding CNS benzodiazepine receptors and  competitively blocking benzodiazepine activation of inhibitory GABAergic  synapses. Animal studies and some human studies appear to demonstrate that  flumazenil has weak intrinsic agonist activity; on the other hand, studies are  inconclusive in demonstrating any inverse agonist effects of this agent.  Evidence available suggests that flumazenil is well tolerated in human beings  over a broad range of doses when given either orally or parenterally and does  not produce serious adverse effects. In the setting of isolated benzodiazepine  overdose, flumazenil is capable of completely reversing coma within one to two  minutes, with this effect lasting between one and five hours. Repeat doses can  be given safely to reverse recurrent effects of longer-acting benzodiazepines.  Flumazenil is undergoing further evaluation by the Food and Drug Administration;  should this drug receive approval, it is likely to be used in emergency  departments as well as in a variety of other clinical settings. First, it could  be used to effect rapid reversal of benzodiazepine-induced sedation that has  been administered to facilitate medical, orthopedic, and surgical procedures,  particularly in the event of inadvertent respiratory depression. Second,  flumazenil might have a therapeutic role in the management of patients who have  taken benzodiazepine overdoses. Although most of these patients can be managed  successfully with supportive therapy alone, it is possible that the use of  flumazenil may obviate the need for intubation and respiratory support in such  patients and eliminate the possible adverse effects of even short-term  endotracheal intubation. Finally, flumazenil could have both diagnostic and  therapeutic value in patients with acute alterations of mental status of unknown  etiology, particularly when possible drug overdose is a consideration. Because  flumazenil appears to be specific in its antagonism of benzodiazepine-induced  respiratory and CNS depression, it could be used empirically to confirm or  exclude a role of benzodiazepines in the generation of mental status changes in  the setting of overdose or coma of unknown origin. This in turn might obviate  the need for further expensive (eg, computed tomography) and sometimes invasive  (eg, lumbar puncture) diagnostic modalities. This might be particularly useful  because there is nothing about benzodiazepine-induced coma that clearly  distinguishes it from other causes of coma; thus, there are no signs or symptoms  that may reasonably allow benzodiazepine overdose to be confirmed or eliminated  on clinical grounds. Further studies will continue to define the ultimate use of  this new agent.', 'The mechanism of action, pharmacokinetics, and use of flumazenil in  benzodiazepine overdose, as well as in the management of other disease states,  are reviewed. Flumazenil interacts at the central benzodiazepine receptor to  antagonize or reverse the behavioral, neurologic, and electrophysiologic effects  of benzodiazepine agonists and inverse agonists. Flumazenil has been studied for  a variety of indications, including as an antidote to benzodiazepine overdose  and for awakening of comatose patients, reversal of sedation after surgery and  in critically ill patients, and management of hepatic encephalopathy. It  improves the level of consciousness in patients with benzodiazepine overdose;  however, resedation may occur within one to two hours after administration, so  repeated doses or a continuous infusion may be required to maintain therapeutic  efficacy. It appears to be effective in reversing sedation induced by midazolam  or diazepam, and case reports suggest that it is useful in awakening comatose  patients, although its clinical utility is questionable. Flumazenil has proved  useful in reversing conscious sedation in critically ill patients, although  response may be dose dependent. Animal models indicate that flumazenil is of  some benefit in hepatic encephalopathy, but until well-designed clinical trials  are conducted, hepatic encephalopathy must be considered an investigational  indication for flumazenil. Adverse reactions include CNS manifestations,  resedation, cardiovascular effects, seizures, and alterations in intracranial  pressure and cerebral perfusion pressure. Hepatic dysfunction results in a  substantial change in the pharmacokinetic profile of flumazenil; therefore,  dosage adjustment may be necessary in patients with hepatic dysfunction or in  those receiving medications that alter flumazenil metabolism. Flumazenil has  been shown to reverse sedation caused by intoxication with benzodiazepines alone  or benzodiazepines in combination with other agents, but it should not be used  when cyclic antidepressant intoxication is suspected. It may be beneficial after  surgery when benzodiazepines have been used as part of anesthesia and after a  diagnostic or surgical procedure when assessment of CNS function is necessary.', 'In a double-blind placebo-controlled prospective clinical trial we studied the  efficacy and safety of the benzodiazepine antagonist, flumazenil. In 23 patients  admitted to the Intensive Care Unit with coma due to overdose with  benzodiazepines or other sedatives, flumazenil i.v. (up to 2 mg or placebo) was  given. In 13 patients given flumazenil the Glasgow Coma Scale (GCS) increased  significantly from 4.9 to 7.8 (p less than 0.05). Six of these 13 patients,  including mainly benzodiazepine mono-intoxications, needed only one series of  injections (up to 1.0 mg flumazenil); the GCS increased thereby from 4.5 to 10.7  within a maximum of 5 min (p less than 0.01). In the remaining 7 patients,  needing two series of injections of flumazenil (up to 2.0 mg), GCS did not rise  significantly and coma was related to intoxications with nonbenzodiazepine  sedatives, flunitrazepam and in one patient, encephalitis. In the 10 patients  receiving placebo, the GCS did not change. A significant increase in the GCS  from 5.5 to 10.8 (p less than 0.001) was, however, observed when flumazenil (up  to 1.0 mg) was given after placebo. In patients with EEG monitoring the changes  in waveform pattern paralleled the clinical response. Effects could be detected  within 1-2 min after flumazenil injection and lasted up to 45 min. There were no  adverse reactions or benzodiazepine withdrawal symptoms. We conclude that  flumazenil is an effective and safe drug in the treatment of benzodiazepine  overdose. The use of flumazenil is of diagnostic value in mixed-drug  intoxications or coma of unknown origin and is of therapeutic importance for  reversal of benzodiazepine intoxications.', ""BACKGROUND: Flumazenil is a competitive benzodiazepine antagonist that acts to  reverse their sedative and hypnotic effects. It is indicated in the management  of benzodiazepine overdose, but its role in the routine reversal of endoscopic  conscious sedation has not been defined. METHODS: Patients undergoing diagnostic upper endoscopy who received sedation  with either diazepam or midazolam alone were given flumazenil 0.2 mg  incrementally immediately following the procedure until awake. They were then  asked to repeat three psychomotor tests measuring cognitive and motor skills,  with their baseline scores compared with postprocedure scores over a 3-hour  period. RESULTS: Full psychomotor function was restored to baseline values within 30  minutes after flumazenil in 79% of patients, with no differences in the reversal  of psychomotor skill impairment observed between diazepam and midazolam  sedation. There was no evidence of rebound sedation seen for up to 3 hours. No  significant anterograde amnesia was evident in 78% of individuals. CONCLUSIONS: These results demonstrate that flumazenil's effects on reversing  psychomotor impairment are similar when midazolam or diazepam are used for  conscious sedation. However, the potential usefulness of routine flumazenil  reversal of conscious sedation will require further evaluation of specific  psychomotor performance skills (such as driving a car) before we lift the  admonition against leaving the endoscopic suite unattended, driving a vehicle,  or operating complicated machinery for several hours."", 'Flumazenil (Ro 15-1788) proved to be a very efficacious competitive antagonist  of benzodiazepines that reliably counteracts their pharmacological actions  within 1-2 min as could be demonstrated in clinical and EEG studies. In general,  a total dose of 0.3-0.8 mg will be sufficient in clinical practice, avoiding  side effects like nausea, tremor, sweating, or transient anxiety that could be  observed when higher dosages were administered. Its therapeutic range is very  high as could be demonstrated in experimental animal in which up to 8.000-fold  the clinical dose was administered. The total volume of distribution (Vdes)  amounts to nearly 1.000 ml/kg BW and the total clearance exceeds 1.200 ml/min,  resulting in a biological half-life of less than 60 min. According to the  benzodiazepine dosage and the rapid plasma concentration decline of flumazenil,  in some cases a resedation could be observed. Hence, a careful observation of  the antagonised patient on the ward is mandatory for 1.5-2 h, even if at first  sight the antagonization seemed successful and the patient fully awake and  cooperative. In anaesthesia, indications to administer flumazenil are adverse  drug reactions and prolonged recovery after adequate benzodiazepine dosage. In  intensive care medicine, the antagonist may be used in the treatment of  benzodiazepine overdose as well as in the differential diagnosis of a coma of  unknown origin. Additionally, the antagonist may be administered to interrupt  benzodiazepine sedation e.g. for neurological examination.', 'Anterograde amnesia, possibly accompanied by acute brain syndrome, is a  potential side-effect of certain benzodiazepines, particularly triazolam.  Flumazenil is a benzodiazepine antagonist that is highly effective in reversing  the central nervous system effects of benzodiazepine overdose. We report a case  of triazolam overdose resulting in anterograde amnesia after flumazenil  administration had restored clear consciousness. The defect in memory may have  been due to too little flumazenil being given or failure of memory consolidation  affected by the character of triazolam during the induced lucent period. We feel  that physicians should be aware of the potential occurrence of acute brain  syndrome in patients with benzodiazepine overdose despite treatment with  flumazenil.', 'In anaesthesia and in the intensive care unit, benzodiazepines have proven safe  and effective agents for the induction and maintenance of sedation for a variety  of therapeutic goals. However, in these contexts, or in benzodiazepine overdose,  it is often desirable to be able to terminate or interrupt sedation without  waiting for the effect of the benzodiazepine to become dissipated by normal  metabolism and excretion. Flumazenil, a 1,4-imidazobenzodiazepine, is a highly  effective, specific benzodiazepine antagonist which is indicated for use when  the effect of a benzodiazepine must be attenuated or terminated at short notice.  It acts by displacing other benzodiazepines from the receptor site by  competitive inhibition. The onset of effect after intravenous administration  occurs within 1 to 3 minutes. The optimal dosage is determined for each patient  by a dose titration procedure and lies in the range 0.2 to 1.0mg in  anaesthesiology, and 0.1 to 2.0mg in intensive care use. Despite its short  elimination half-life of around 1 hour, after general anaesthesia or conscious  to moderate sedation for short procedures, a single dose of flumazenil is  usually sufficient to attain and maintain the desired level of consciousness.  After intoxication with high benzodiazepine doses, the duration of effect of a  single dose of flumazenil is not expected to exceed 1 hour. In such cases, the  period of wakefulness can be prolonged as necessary by repeated low intravenous  doses of flumazenil or by infusion (0.1 mg/hour). Flumazenil is well tolerated  both systemically and locally. The only adverse events seen with greater  frequency after flumazenil compared with placebo were nausea and/or vomiting  after general anaesthesia, although the incidence of actual vomiting was not  significantly different between the 2 groups. Since these effects were virtually  absent in studies of intensive care patients and after sedation for short  procedures, and were not seen in tolerability studies in healthy volunteers  receiving intravenous bolus doses of up to 100mg, there may be a link between  these symptoms and the other agents used in general anaesthesia, some of which  have well-known emetic properties. Thus, flumazenil provides a safe and  effective means of attenuating or reversing the CNS-depressant effects of  benzodiazepines whenever indicated, e.g. following benzodiazepine-induced  general anaesthesia, conscious sedation, or after benzodiazepine overdose,  either alone or in combination with other agents.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 400  WORDS)', 'Flumazenil is a recently discovered pharmacologic antagonist of the CNS effects  of benzodiazepines.

Repeat doses can  be given safely to reverse recurrent effects of longer-acting benzodiazepines.  Flumazenil is undergoing further evaluation by the Food and Drug Administration;  should this drug receive approval, it is likely to be used in emergency  departments as well as in a variety of other clinical settings. First, it could  be used to effect rapid reversal of benzodiazepine-induced sedation that has  been administered to facilitate medical, orthopedic, and surgical procedures,  particularly in the event of inadvertent respiratory depression. Second,  flumazenil might have a therapeutic role in the management of patients who have  taken benzodiazepine overdoses. Although most of these patients can be managed  successfully with supportive therapy alone, it is possible that the use of  flumazenil may obviate the need for intubation and respiratory support in such  patients and eliminate the possible adverse effects of even short-term  endotracheal intubation. Finally, flumazenil could have both diagnostic and  therapeutic value in patients with acute alterations of mental status of unknown  etiology, particularly when possible drug overdose is a consideration. Because  flumazenil appears to be specific in its antagonism of benzodiazepine-induced  respiratory and CNS depression, it could be used empirically to confirm or  exclude a role of benzodiazepines in the generation of mental status changes in  the setting of overdose or coma of unknown origin. This in turn might obviate  the need for further expensive (eg, computed tomography) and sometimes invasive  (eg, lumbar puncture) diagnostic modalities. This might be particularly useful  because there is nothing about benzodiazepine-induced coma that clearly  distinguishes it from other causes of coma; thus, there are no signs or symptoms  that may reasonably allow benzodiazepine overdose to be confirmed or eliminated  on clinical grounds. Further studies will continue to define the ultimate use of  this new agent.', 'Flumazenil (Ro 15-1788) proved to be a very efficacious competitive antagonist  of benzodiazepines that reliably counteracts their pharmacological actions  within 1-2 min as could be demonstrated in clinical and EEG studies. In general,  a total dose of 0.3-0.8 mg will be sufficient in clinical practice, avoiding  side effects like nausea, tremor, sweating, or transient anxiety that could be  observed when higher dosages were administered. Its therapeutic range is very  high as could be demonstrated in experimental animal in which up to 8.000-fold  the clinical dose was administered. The total volume of distribution (Vdes)  amounts to nearly 1.000 ml/kg BW and the total clearance exceeds 1.200 ml/min,  resulting in a biological half-life of less than 60 min. According to the  benzodiazepine dosage and the rapid plasma concentration decline of flumazenil,  in some cases a resedation could be observed. Hence, a careful observation of  the antagonised patient on the ward is mandatory for 1.5-2 h, even if at first  sight the antagonization seemed successful and the patient fully awake and  cooperative. In anaesthesia, indications to administer flumazenil are adverse  drug reactions and prolonged recovery after adequate benzodiazepine dosage. In  intensive care medicine, the antagonist may be used in the treatment of  benzodiazepine overdose as well as in the differential diagnosis of a coma of  unknown origin. Additionally, the antagonist may be administered to interrupt  benzodiazepine sedation e.g. for neurological examination.', 'For the first time a causal treatment of hepatic encephalopathy may be possible  by the benzodiazepine antagonist flumazenil. In contrast to all other treatments  used so far by flumazenil hepatic encephalopathy improves within minutes.  Flumazenil is the first benzodiazepine antagonist which can be used in humans  and is a well established for treatment of benzodiazepine overdose. For  treatment of hepatic encephalopathy development of a new antagonist with a  longer half-life is desirable. However, ut should be stressed that the current  experience with flumazenil is limited and that the effects of flumazenil on  hepatic encephalopathy is not proven by randomized controlled studies.  Therefore, this drug should only be used in clinical studies.']","Flumazenil should be used in all patients presenting with suspected benzodiazepine overdose. Flumazenil is a  potent benzodiazepine receptor antagonist that competitively blocks the central effects of benzodiazepines and reverses behavioral, neurologic, and electrophysiologic effects of benzodiazepine overdose. Clinical efficacy and safety of flumazenil in treatment of benzodiazepine overdose has been confirmed in a number of rigorous clinical trials. In addition, flumazenil is also useful to to reverse benzodiazepine induced sedation and to and to diagnose benzodiazepine overdose."
105,What are the computational methods for the prediction of beta-barrel transmembrane proteins?,"['Transmembrane beta barrel (TMB) proteins are found in the outer membranes of  bacteria, mitochondria and chloroplasts. TMBs are involved in a variety of  functions such as mediating flux of metabolites and active transport of  siderophores, enzymes and structural proteins, and in the translocation across  or insertion into membranes. We present here TMBHMM, a computational method  based on a hidden Markov model for predicting the structural topology of  putative TMBs from sequence. In addition to predicting transmembrane strands,  TMBHMM also predicts the exposure status (i.e., exposed to the membrane or  hidden in the protein structure) of the residues in the transmembrane region,  which is a novel feature of the TMBHMM method. Furthermore, TMBHMM can also  predict the membrane residues that are not part of beta barrel forming strands.  The training of the TMBHMM was performed on a non-redundant data set of 19 TMBs.  The self-consistency test yielded Q(2) accuracy of 0.87, Q(3) accuracy of 0.83,  Matthews correlation coefficient of 0.74 and SOV for beta strand of 0.95. In  this self-consistency test the method predicted 83% of transmembrane residues  with correct exposure status. On an unseen, non-redundant test data set of 10  proteins, the 2-state and 3-state TMBHMM prediction accuracies are around 73%  and 72%, respectively, and are comparable to other methods from the literature.  The TMBHMM web server takes an amino acid sequence or a multiple sequence  alignment as an input and predicts the exposure status and the structural  topology as output. The TMBHMM web server is available under the tmbhmm tab at:  http://service.bioinformatik.uni-saarland.de/tmx-site/.', 'BACKGROUND: Helical membrane proteins are vital for the interaction of cells  with their environment. Predicting the location of membrane helices in protein  amino acid sequences provides substantial understanding of their structure and  function and identifies membrane proteins in sequenced genomes. Currently there  is no comprehensive benchmark tool for evaluating prediction methods, and there  is no publication comparing all available prediction tools. Current benchmark  literature is outdated, as recently determined membrane protein structures are  not included. Current literature is also limited to global assessments, as  specialised benchmarks for predicting specific classes of membrane proteins were  not previously carried out. DESCRIPTION: We present a benchmark server at  http://sydney.edu.au/pharmacy/sbio/software/TMH_benchmark.shtml that uses recent  high resolution protein structural data to provide a comprehensive assessment of  the accuracy of existing membrane helix prediction methods. The server further  allows a user to compare uploaded predictions generated by novel methods,  permitting the comparison of these novel methods against all existing methods  compared by the server. Benchmark metrics include sensitivity and specificity of  predictions for membrane helix location and orientation, and many others. The  server allows for customised evaluations such as assessing prediction method  performances for specific helical membrane protein subtypes.We report results  for custom benchmarks which illustrate how the server may be used for  specialised benchmarks. Which prediction method is the best performing method  depends on which measure is being benchmarked. The OCTOPUS membrane helix  prediction method is consistently one of the highest performing methods across  all measures in the benchmarks that we performed. CONCLUSIONS: The benchmark server allows general and specialised assessment of  existing and novel membrane helix prediction methods. Users can employ this  benchmark server to determine the most suitable method for the type of  prediction the user needs to perform, be it general whole-genome annotation or  the prediction of specific types of helical membrane protein. Creators of novel  prediction methods can use this benchmark server to evaluate the performance of  their new methods. The benchmark server will be a valuable tool for researchers  seeking to extract more sophisticated information from the large and growing  protein sequence databases.', 'BACKGROUND: Prediction of the transmembrane strands and topology of beta-barrel  outer membrane proteins is of interest in current bioinformatics research.  Several methods have been applied so far for this task, utilizing different  algorithmic techniques and a number of freely available predictors exist. The  methods can be grossly divided to those based on Hidden Markov Models (HMMs), on  Neural Networks (NNs) and on Support Vector Machines (SVMs). In this work, we  compare the different available methods for topology prediction of beta-barrel  outer membrane proteins. We evaluate their performance on a non-redundant  dataset of 20 beta-barrel outer membrane proteins of gram-negative bacteria,  with structures known at atomic resolution. Also, we describe, for the first  time, an effective way to combine the individual predictors, at will, to a  single consensus prediction method. RESULTS: We assess the statistical significance of the performance of each  prediction scheme and conclude that Hidden Markov Model based methods,  HMM-B2TMR, ProfTMB and PRED-TMBB, are currently the best predictors, according  to either the per-residue accuracy, the segments overlap measure (SOV) or the  total number of proteins with correctly predicted topologies in the test set.  Furthermore, we show that the available predictors perform better when only  transmembrane beta-barrel domains are used for prediction, rather than the  precursor full-length sequences, even though the HMM-based predictors are not  influenced significantly. The consensus prediction method performs significantly  better than each individual available predictor, since it increases the accuracy  up to 4% regarding SOV and up to 15% in correctly predicted topologies. CONCLUSIONS: The consensus prediction method described in this work, optimizes  the predicted topology with a dynamic programming algorithm and is implemented  in a web-based application freely available to non-commercial users at  http://bioinformatics.biol.uoa.gr/ConBBPRED.', 'SUMMARY: The annotation of membrane proteins in proteomes is an important  problem of Computational Biology, especially after the development of  high-throughput techniques that allow fast and efficient genome sequencing.  Among membrane proteins, transmembrane β-barrels (TMBBs) are poorly represented  in the database of protein structures (PDB) and difficult to identify with  experimental approaches. They are, however, extremely important, playing key  roles in several cell functions and bacterial pathogenicity. TMBBs are included  in the lipid bilayer with a β-barrel structure and are presently found in the  outer membranes of Gram-negative bacteria, mitochondria and chloroplasts.  Recently, we developed two top-performing methods based on machine-learning  approaches to tackle both the detection of TMBBs in sets of proteins and the  prediction of their topology. Here, we present our BETAWARE program that  includes both approaches and can run as a standalone program on a linux-based  computer to easily address in-home massive protein annotation or filtering.

In  general, prediction accuracy either in identifying new integral membrane  proteins or transmembrane regions of known integral membrane proteins depends  strongly on how closely the query fits the model. Because of this, the best  approach is an opportunistic one: submit the protein of interest to all methods  and choose the results with the highest confidence scores.', 'MOTIVATION: Transmembrane β barrel proteins (TMBs) are found in the outer  membrane of Gram-negative bacteria, chloroplast and mitochondria. They play a  major role in the translocation machinery, pore formation, membrane anchoring  and ion exchange. TMBs are also promising targets for antimicrobial drugs and  vaccines. Given the difficulty in membrane protein structure determination,  computational methods to identify TMBs and predict the topology of TMBs are  important. RESULTS: Here, we present BOCTOPUS; an improved method for the topology  prediction of TMBs by employing a combination of support vector machines (SVMs)  and Hidden Markov Models (HMMs). The SVMs and HMMs account for local and global  residue preferences, respectively. Based on a 10-fold cross-validation test,  BOCTOPUS performs better than all existing methods, reaching a Q3 accuracy of  87%. Further, BOCTOPUS predicted the correct number of strands for 83% proteins  in the dataset. BOCTOPUS might also help in reliable identification of TMBs by  using it as an additional filter to methods specialized in this task.

Loop exposure  outside the bacterial cell membranes makes TMBBs important targets for vaccine  or drug therapies. In genomes, they are not highly represented and are difficult  to identify with experimental approaches. Several computational methods have  been developed to discriminate TMBBs from other types of proteins. However, the  best performing approaches have a high fraction of false positive predictions. RESULTS: In this article, we introduce a new machine learning approach for TMBB  detection based on N-to-1 Extreme Learning Machines that significantly  outperforms previous methods achieving a Matthews correlation coefficient of  0.82, a probability of correct prediction of 0.92 and a sensitivity of 0.73.', 'β-Barrel membrane proteins are found in the outer membrane of gram-negative  bacteria, mitochondria, and chloroplasts. They are important for pore formation,  membrane anchoring, and enzyme activity. These proteins are also often  responsible for bacterial virulence. Due to difficulties in experimental  structure determination, they are sparsely represented in the protein structure  databank. We have developed a computational method for predicting structures of  the transmembrane (TM) domains of β-barrel membrane proteins. Based on physical  principles, our method can predict structures of the TM domain of β-barrel  membrane proteins of novel topology, including those from eukaryotic  mitochondria. Our method is based on a model of physical interactions, a  discrete conformational state space, an empirical potential function, as well as  a model to account for interstrand loop entropy. We are able to construct  three-dimensional atomic structure of the TM domains from sequences for a set of  23 nonhomologous proteins (resolution 1.8-3.0 Å). The median rmsd of TM domains  containing 75-222 residues between predicted and measured structures is 3.9 Å  for main chain atoms. In addition, stability determinants and protein-protein  interaction sites can be predicted. Such predictions on eukaryotic mitochondria  outer membrane protein Tom40 and VDAC are confirmed by independent mutagenesis  and chemical cross-linking studies. These results suggest that our model  captures key components of the organization principles of β-barrel membrane  protein assembly.', 'We identify and describe a set of tools readily available for integral membrane  protein prediction.

Our method showed a leave-one-out cross validation accuracy  of 96% in a set of 28 OMPs, which have the range of 8-22 beta-strand segments.  The beta-strand segments in OMPs and the residues in membrane spanning segments  are correctly predicted with the accuracy of 96% and 87%, respectively.

Initial methods developed for the prediction of the transmembrane beta strands were based on hydrophobicity analysis, using sliding windows along the sequence, in order to capture the alternating patterns of hydrophobic-hydrophilic residues of the transmembrane strands, or using generalized secondary structure prediction methods. Other approaches included the construction of special empirical rules using amino-acid propensities and prior knowledge of the structural nature of the proteins, and the development of Neural Network-based predictors to predict the location of alpha-carbon atoms with respect to the membrane. During the last few years, other more refined methods, appeared, including: Neural Networks, Hidden Markov Models, Support Vector Machines, k-Nearest Neighbors, Radial Basis Functions, Bayesian Networks, Genetic Algorithms, Mahalanobis Discriminant Functions, Cellular Automata, N-to-1 Extreme Learning Machines. Hidden Markov Model-based methods are among the most successful in topology prediction, being able to capture the unique architecture of beta-barrel transmembrane proteins. Consensus methods, as well as pipelines of several related tools (e.g. subcellular localization prediciton, alpha-helical transmembrane protein prediction, signal-peptide/lipoprotein prediction) have also used for discriminating beta-barrel transmembrane proteins. Recently, a number of methods for predicting more detailed structural features (e.g. surface accessibility, residue contacts, even detailed atomic 3D models) tailored to beta-barrel transmembrane proteins have been developed, based on knowledge-based potential functions, graph theoretic models, physical models and multi-tape S-attribute grammars.

106,What is the most common feature of the Doege–Potter syndrome?,"['Syndrome Doege-Potter is a paraneoplastic syndrome in which hypoglycemia is the  result of tumors producing insulin growth factor-like (IGF-II) it is most often  solitary fibrous tumor of the pleura (TFSP). These are rare and may be  discovered incidentally, during non-specific respiratory symptoms or during  hypoglycemia. Hypoglycemia occurs in tumors of large volume and it disappears  after surgery, which is the treatment of choice for a permanent cure in most  cases. We present a case of Doege-Potter syndrome whose interest is to consider  the TFSP as a cause of hypoglycemia in patients with pleural tumors.', 'AIM: Doege-Potter syndrome is a rare condition consisting of a mesenchymal  tumor, either benign or malignant, accompanied by severe hypoglycemia. The  syndrome was first described independently by two American physicians, Karl  Walter Doege (1867-1932) and Roy Pilling Potter (1879-1968), in 1930, but it was  not before 1988 that it was associated with non-islet cell tumor production of  insulin growth factor (IGF) that induces hypoglycemia as a paraneoplastic  syndrome. CASE PRESENTATION: We present the case of a 61-year-old woman with severe  hypoglycemia that induced seizures. On the general check-up, a massive tumor  occupying the lower part of left hemi-thorax was discovered. Initially,  corticosteroids, glucose i.v. and high carbohydrate diet managed to prevent the  severe blood glucose drop. Surgery exposed a massive well-defined pleural tumor.  After surgical removal, blood glucose stabilized. Histological examination  confirmed the fibrous tumor that proved to be malignant on immunochemistry. DISCUSSION: The authors discuss other cases reported in the literature of this  rare condition and its pathogenic mechanisms, the presented case being the first  reported in Romania. CONCLUSIONS: The clinician should be aware of the possible existence of a  pleural tumor in a patient presenting an unexplained hypoglycemia because the  surgical removal of the tumor can solve the clinical manifestations.', 'Doege-Potter syndrome\xa0is a paraneoplastic\xa0syndrome\xa0characterized by non-islet  cell tumor hypoglycemia secondary to a solitary fibrous tumor. These tumors are  rare and usually asymptomatic. The syndrome of hypoglycemia is seen in less than  5% of the cases, and the associated tumors are large with a high mitotic rate.  The cause of hypoglycemia is related to insulin-like growth factors produced by  these tumors called ""big"" IGF-2. Several biological tests can demonstrate the  increase of ""big"" IGF-2\xa0plasma levels confirming the diagnosis of non-islet cell  tumor induced hypoglycemia. The diagnosis is suggested by imaging but diagnostic  confirmation is provided by the surgery, which remains the treatment of choice.  Resection in many cases is the cure leading to hypoglycemia resolution.  Recurrences and malignant transformations are possible which imposes a long-term  monitoring. We report a case with relapsed malignant pleural fibrous tumor for  which the pathophysiological mechanism of hypoglycemia could be documented as a  paraneoplastic syndrome.', 'Solitary fibrous tumour of the pleura (SFTP) is a rare primary tumour of the  pleura associated with 4% of cases with a paraneoplastic hypoglycaemia, termed  Doege-Potter syndrome (DPS). We report a case of DPS presenting with severe coma  in a 90-year-old woman. The cause was a malignant SFTP treated with surgical  resection, from which the patient made a full recovery with prevention of  recurrent hypoglycaemia. Surgical resection of the SFTP presenting with  symptomatic hypoglycaemia should be considered even in elderly patients.', 'INTRODUCTION: Doege-Potter syndrome is a paraneoplastic syndrome characterized  by non-islet cell tumor hypoglycemia secondary to a solitary fibrous tumor. This  tumor causes hypoglycemia by the secretion of a prohormone form of insulin-like  growth factor II. We describe the diagnosis and management of Doege-Potter  syndrome and the use of transarterial chemoembolization in a patient with a  malignant extrapleural solitary fibrous tumor. CASE PRESENTATION: Our patient was a 64-year-old Caucasian woman who initially  presented with urinary incontinence and was found to have a 14.5×9.0×9.0cm  retroperitoneal solitary fibrous tumor compressing her bladder. Her tumor was  surgically resected but recurred with multiple hepatic metastatic lesions. The  hepatic metastases progressed despite systemic chemotherapy and treatment with  doxorubicin transarterial chemoembolization. Her course was complicated by the  development of recurrent fasting hypoglycemia, most likely secondary to  Doege-Potter syndrome. Her hypoglycemia was managed with corticosteroid therapy  and frequent scheduled nutrient intake overnight. CONCLUSIONS: The rarity of hepatic solitary fibrous tumors and consequent lack  of controlled trials make this report significant in that it describes the  diagnostic approach to Doege-Potter syndrome, describes our experience with the  use of doxorubicin transarterial chemoembolization, and presents management  options for tumor-associated hypoglycemia in the case of extensive disease not  amenable to surgical resection.', 'Steven Pfeiffer syndrome pedigrees (three 3 generation and four 2 generation)  have been recorded to date in addition to at least a dozen sporadic cases.  Autosomal dominant inheritance with complete penetrance is characteristic of the  7 familial instances. Variable expressivity has involved mostly the presence or  absence of syndactyly and the degree of syndactyly when present. Classic  Pfeiffer syndrome is designated type I. Type 2 consists of cloverleaf skull with  Pfeiffer hands and feet together with ankylosis of the elbows. Such patients do  poorly with an early death. All reported instances to date have been sporadic.  Type 3 is similar to type 2 but without cloverleaf skull. Ocular proptosis is  severe in degree and the anterior cranial base is markedly short. These patients  also do poorly and tend to have an early death. To date all cases have occurred  sporadically. Although these 3 clinical subtypes do not have status as separate  entities, their diagnostic and prognostic implications are important. Type 1 is  commonly associated with normal intelligence, generally good outcome, and can be  found dominantly inherited in some families. Types 2 and 3 generally have severe  neurological compromise, poor prognosis, early death, and sporadic occurrence.  Recognition of type 3 is particularly important because extreme ocular proptosis  in the absence of cloverleaf skull but with various visceral anomalies can  result in failure to diagnose Pfeiffer syndrome and labeling the patient as an  ""unknown"" or as a ""newly recognized entity.""(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)', 'CLINICAL CHARACTERISTICS: Mowat-Wilson syndrome (MWS) is characterized by  distinctive facial features (widely spaced eyes, broad eyebrows with a medial  flare, low-hanging columella, prominent or pointed chin, open-mouth expression,  and uplifted earlobes with a central depression), congenital heart defects with  predilection for abnormalities of the pulmonary arteries and/or valves,  Hirschsprung disease or chronic constipation, genitourinary anomalies  (particularly hypospadias in males), and hypogenesis or agenesis of the corpus  callosum. Most affected individuals have moderate-to-severe intellectual  disability. Speech is typically limited to a few words or is absent, with  relative preservation of receptive language skills. Growth restriction with  microcephaly and seizure disorder are also common. Most affected people have a  happy demeanor and a wide-based gait that can sometimes be confused with  Angelman syndrome. DIAGNOSIS/TESTING: The diagnosis of MWS is established in a proband with classic  dysmorphic facial features and developmental delay\xa0/ intellectual disability  and/or a heterozygous pathogenic variant in ZEB2 identified by molecular genetic  testing. MANAGEMENT: Treatment of manifestations: Care by the appropriate specialist for  dental anomalies, seizures, ocular abnormalities, congenital heart defects,  chronic constipation, Hirschsprung disease, genitourinary abnormalities, and  pectus anomalies of the chest and/or foot/ankle anomalies; educational  intervention and speech therapy beginning in infancy. Surveillance: Annual eye  examination in childhood to monitor for strabismus and refractive errors;  monitoring for otitis media; regular developmental assessments to plan/refine  educational interventions; periodic reevaluation by a clinical geneticist. GENETIC COUNSELING: MWS is an autosomal dominant disorder caused by a pathogenic  variant in ZEB2, a heterozygous deletion of 2q22.3 involving ZEB2, or (rarely) a  chromosome rearrangement that disrupts ZEB2. Almost all individuals reported to  date have been simplex cases (i.e., a single occurrence in a family) resulting  from a de novo genetic alteration; rarely, recurrence in a family has been  reported when a parent has a low level of somatic or presumed germline mosaicism  for a MWS-causing pathogenic variant. Individuals with MWS are not known to  reproduce. Once the causative genetic alteration has been identified in the  proband, prenatal testing may be offered to parents of a child with MWS because  of the recurrence risk associated with the possibility of parental mosaicism or  a balanced chromosome rearrangement.', 'The syndromes of Sotos and Weaver are paradigmatic of the daily nosologic  difficulties faced by clinical geneticists attempting to diagnose and counsel,  and to give accurate prognoses in cases of extensive phenotypic overlap between  molecularly undefined entities. Vertebrate development is constrained into only  very few final or common developmental paths; therefore, no developmental  anomaly seen in humans is unique to (""pathognomonic"" of) one syndrome. Thus, it  is not surprising that prenatal overgrowth occurs in several syndromes,  including the Sotos and Weaver syndromes. Are they sufficiently different in  other respects to allow the postulation of locus (rather than allele)  heterogeneity? Phenotypic data in both conditions are biased because of  ascertainment of propositi, and the apparent differences between them may be  entirely artificial as they were between the G and BBB syndromes. On the other  hand, the Sotos syndrome may be a cancer syndrome, the Weaver syndrome not  (though a neuroblastoma was reported in the latter); in the former there is also  remarkably advanced dental maturation rarely commented on in the latter. In  Weaver syndrome there are more conspicuous contractures and a facial appearance  that experts find convincingly different from that of Sotos individuals.  Nevertheless, the hypothesis of locus heterogeneity is testable; at the moment  we are inclined to favor the hypothesis of allele heterogeneity. An  international effort is required to map, isolate, and sequence the causal gene  or genes.', 'Mowat-Wilson syndrome (MWS) is a multiple congenital anomaly syndrome  characterized by a distinct facial phenotype (high forehead, frontal bossing,  large eyebrows, medially flaring and sparse in the middle part, hypertelorism,  deep set but large eyes, large and uplifted ear lobes, with a central  depression, saddle nose with prominent rounded nasal tip, prominent columella,  open mouth, with M-shaped upper lip, frequent smiling, and a prominent but  narrow and triangular pointed chin), moderate-to-severe intellectual deficiency,  epilepsy and variable congenital malformations including Hirschsprung disease  (HSCR), genitourinary anomalies (in particular hypospadias in males), congenital  heart defects, agenesis of the corpus callosum and eye anomalies. The prevalence  of MWS is currently unknown, but 171 patients have been reported so far. It  seems probable that MWS is under-diagnosed, particularly in patients without  HSCR. MWS is caused by heterozygous mutations or deletions in the Zinc finger  E-box-binding homeobox 2 gene, ZEB2, previously called ZFHX1B (SIP1). To date,  over 100 deletions/mutations have been reported in patients with a typical  phenotype; they are frequently whole gene deletions or truncating mutations,  suggesting that haploinsufficiency is the main pathological mechanism. Studies  of genotype-phenotype analysis show that facial gestalt and delayed psychomotor  development are constant clinical features, while the frequent and severe  congenital malformations are variable. In a small number of patients, unusual  mutations can lead to an atypical phenotype. The facial phenotype is  particularly important for the initial clinical diagnosis and provides the  hallmark warranting ZEB2 mutational analysis, even in the absence of HSCR. The  majority of MWS cases reported so far were sporadic, therefore the recurrence  risk is low. Nevertheless, rare cases of sibling recurrence have been observed.  Congenital malformations and seizures require precocious clinical investigation  with intervention of several specialists (including neonatologists and  pediatricians). Psychomotor development is delayed in all patients, therefore  rehabilitation (physical therapy, psychomotor and speech therapy) should be  started as soon as possible.', 'CHARGE (coloboma of the eye, heart defects, choanal atresia, retarded growth and  development, genital hypoplasia and ear anomalies and/or hearing loss) syndrome  is a rare genetic, multiple-malformation syndrome. About 80% of patients with a  clinical diagnose, have a mutation or a deletion in the gene encoding  chromodomain helicase DNA-binding protein 7 (CHD7). Genotype-phenotype  correlation is only partly known. In this nationwide study, phenotypic  characteristics of 18 Danish CHD7 mutation positive CHARGE individuals (N = 18)  are presented. We studied patient records, clinical photographs, computed  tomography, and magnetic resonance imaging (MRI). Information was not available  for all traits in all subjects. Therefore, the results are presented as  fractions. The following prevalence of cardinal symptoms were found: coloboma,  16/17; heart defects, 14/18; choanal atresia, 7/17; retarded growth and  development, 11/13; genital abnormalities, 5/18; ear anomalies, 15/17 and  sensorineural hearing loss, 14/15. Vestibular dysfunction (10/13) and swallowing  problems (12/15) were other frequent cranial nerve dysfunctions.  Three-dimensional reconstructions of MRI scans showed temporal bone  abnormalities in >85%. CHARGE syndrome present a broad phenotypic spectrum,  although some clinical features are more frequently occurring than others. Here,  we suggest that genetic testing for CHD7 mutation should be considered in  neonates with a specific combination of several clinical symptoms.']",Doege-Potter syndrome is a paraneoplastic syndrome characterized by hypoglycemia secondary to a solitary fibrous tumor of the pleura.
107,List programs suitable for pharmacophore modelling,"[""The proton-coupled amino acid transporter hPAT1 has recently gained much  interest due to its ability to transport small drugs thereby allowing their oral  administration. A three-dimensional quantitative structure-activity relationship  (3D QSAR) study has been performed on its natural and synthetic substrates  employing comparative molecular similarity indices analysis (CoMSIA) to  investigate the structural requirements for substrates and to derive a  predictive model that may be used for the design of new prodrugs. The  cross-validated CoMSIA models have been derived from a training set of 40  compounds and the predictive ability of the resulting models has been evaluated  against a test set of 10 compounds. Despite the relatively narrow range of  binding affinities (K(i) values) reliable statistical models with good  predictive power have been obtained. The best CoMSIA model in terms of a proper  balance of all statistical terms and the overall contribution of individual  properties has been obtained by considering steric, hydrophobic, hydrogen bond  donor and acceptor descriptors (q(cv)(2)=0.683, r(2)=0.958 and  r(PRED)(2)=0.666). The 3D QSAR model provides insight in the interactions  between substrates and hPAT1 on the molecular level and allows the prediction of  affinity constants of new compounds. A pharmacophore model has been generated  from the training set by means of the MOE (molecular operating environment)  program. This model has been used as a query for virtual screening to retrieve  potential new substrates from the small-molecule, 'lead-like' databases of MOE.  The affinities of the compounds were predicted and 11 compounds were identified  as possible high-affinity substrates. Two selected compounds strongly inhibited  the hPAT mediated l-[(3)H]proline uptake into Caco-2 cells constitutively  expressing the transport protein."", 'Pancreatic cholesterol esterase (CEase) is a serine hydrolase involved in the  hydrolysis of variety of lipids and transport of free cholesterol. In this  study, pharmacophore hypotheses based on known inhibitors were generated using  common feature pharmacophore generation protocol available in Discovery Studio  program. The best pharmacophore model containing two hydrogen bond acceptor and  three hydrophobic features was selected and validated. It was further used in  screening three diverse chemical databases. Hit compounds were subjected to  drug-likeness and molecular docking studies. Four hits, namely SEW00846,  NCI0040784, GK03167, and CD10645, were selected based on the GOLD fitness score  and interaction with active site amino acids. All hit compounds were further  optimized to improve their binding in the active site. The optimized compounds  were found to have improved binding at the active site. Strongly binding  optimized hits at the active site can act as virtual leads in potent CEase  inhibitor designing.', 'Erectile dysfunction (ED) is a sexual disorder mainly caused by decrease in  cellular concentration of cyclic guanosine monophosphate (cGMP), which is  degraded by phosphodiesterase type-5 (PDE-5). As a potent therapeutic target,  inhibitors such as Viagra , Cialis, and Levitra have already been developed to  target PDE-5 for treating ED; traditional Chinese medicine, Epimedium  sagittatum, also has shown prominent results as well. To developed new PDE-5  inhibitors, we performed a virtual screening of traditional Chinese medicine  (TCM) database and docking analyses to identify candidates. Known PDE-5  inhibitors were used to construct a three dimensional quantitative  structure-activity relationship (3D QSAR) model by HypoGen program. From docking  analyses, isochlorogenic acid b was identified as the most potential inhibitory  compound. De novo evolution designed 47 derivatives. Of the 47 derivatives,  seven were able to map into the pharmacophore model, and these seven compounds  were suggested to be the most promising leads for inhibiting PDE-5. An analysis  of the hydrogen bond interactions formed between the docked ligands and PDE-5  identified ASN662, SER663 and GLN817 as the most frequently interacting  residues. A total of eight novel leading compounds were identified to have  favorable interaction with PDE-5. These compounds all had hydrogen bond  interactions with three key residues that could be further investigated for  understanding of PDE-5 and ligands interaction.', ""Inhibitors of the 5-Lipoxygenase (5-LOX) pathway have a therapeutic potential in  a variety of inflammatory disorders such as asthma. In this study, chemical  feature based pharmacophore models of inhibitors of 5-LOX have been developed  with the aid of HipHop and HypoGen modules within Catalyst program package. The  best quantitative pharmacophore model, Hypo1, which has the highest correlation  coefficient (0.97), consists of two hydrogen-bond acceptors, one hydrophobic  feature and one ring aromatic feature. Hypo1 was further validated by test set  and cross validation method. The application of the model shows great success in  predicting the activities of 65 known 5-LOX inhibitors in our test set with a  correlation coefficient of 0.85 with a cross validation of 95% confidence level,  proving that the model is reliable in identifying structurally diverse compounds  for inhibitory activity against 5-LOX. Furthermore, Hypo1 was used as a 3D query  for screening Maybridge and NCI databases within catalyst and also drug like  compounds obtained from Enamine Ltd, which follow Lipinski's rule of five. The  hit compounds were subsequently subjected to filtering by docking and  visualization, to identify the potential lead molecules. Finally 5 potential  lead compounds, identified in the above process, were evaluated for their  inhibitory activities. These studies resulted in the identification of two  compounds with potent inhibition of 5-LOX activity with IC(50) of 14 microM and  35 microM, respectively. These studies thus validate the pharmacophore model  generated and suggest the usefulness of the model in screening of various small  molecule libraries and identification of potential lead compounds for 5-LOX  inhibition."", 'Three-dimensional pharmacophore models were generated for AT1 and ET(A)  receptors based on highly selective AT1 and ET(A) antagonists using the program  Catalyst/HipHop. Both the best pharmacophore model for selective AT1 antagonists  (Hypo-AT(1)-7) and ETA antagonists (Hypo-ET(A)-1) were obtained through a  careful validation process. All five features contained in Hypo-AT(1)-7 and  Hypo-ET(A)-1 (hydrogen-bond acceptor (A), hydrophobic aliphatic (Z), negative  ionizable (N), ring aromatic (R), and hydrophobic aromatic (Y)) seem to be  essential for antagonists in terms of binding activity. Dual AT1 and ET(A)  receptor antagonists (DARAs) can map to both Hypo-AT(1)-7 and Hypo-ET(A)-1,  separately. Comparison of Hypo-AT(1)-7 and Hypo-ET(A)-1, not only AT1 and ET(A)  antagonist pharmacophore models consist of essential features necessary for  compounds to be highly active and selective toward their corresponding receptor,  but also have something in common. The results in this study will act as a  valuable tool for designing and researching structural relationship of novel  dual AT1 and ET(A) receptor antagonists.', 'The receptor tyrosine kinase c-Met has multiple roles during cancer development  and is currently considered as a promising target for cancer therapies.  Pharmacophore models of c-Met kinase inhibitors have been developed based on 22  diverse compounds by using HypoGen algorithm implemented in Discovery studio  program package. The best quantitative pharmacophore model, Hypo 1, which had  the highest correlation coefficient (0.9623), consists of two hydrogen bond  acceptors, one hydrophobic feature and two excluded volumes. Then best model was  validated by test set prediction, Fischer randomization and decoy set. Besides,  the features of Hypo1 were verified to correctly reflect the interactions  between kinase active site and its ligands by comparison and superimposition of  Hypo 1 in active site of c-Met kinase. The results shows that Hypo 1 has strong  capability to identify c-Met kinase inhibitors and to predict the activities of  structurally diverse molecules. Therefore, our pharmacophore models were  considered as valuable tools for the discovery and development of specific c-Met  kinase inhibitors.', 'Febrifugine and its derivatives are effective against Plasmodium falciparum.  Using PHASE algorithm, a five-point pharmacophore model with two hydrogen bond  acceptor (A), one positively ionizable (P) and two aromatic rings (R), was  developed to derive a predictive ligand-based statistically significant  3D-quantitative structure-activity relationship (QSAR) model (r(2) = 0.972, SD =  0.3, F = 173.4, Q(2) = 0.712, RMSE = 0.3, Person-R = 0.94, and r(2) pred = 0.8)  to explicate the structural attributes crucial for antimalarial activity. The  developed pharmacophore model and 3D QSAR model can be a substantial tool for  virtual screening and related antimalarial drug discovery research.', 'Computational conformational sampling is integral to small molecule  pharmaceutical research, for detailed conformational analysis and  high-throughput 3D library enumeration. These two regimes were tested in details  for the general-purpose modeling program MOE, using its three conformational  sampling methods, i.e. systematic search, stochastic search, and Conformation  Import. The tests include i) identification of the global energy minimum, ii)  reproduction of the bioactive conformation, iii) measures of conformational  coverage with 3D descriptors, and iv) compute times. The bioactive conformers  are from a new set of 256 diverse, druglike, protein-bound ligands compiled and  analyzed with particular care. The MOE results are compared to those obtained  from the established program Catalyst. Key parameters controlling the  conformational coverage were varied systematically. Coverage and diversity of  the conformational space were characterized with unique pharmacophore triplets  or quadruplets. Overall, the protocols in both MOE and Catalyst performed well  for their intended tasks. MOE performed at least as well as Catalyst for  high-throughput library generation and detailed conformational modeling. This  work provides a guide and specific recommendations regarding the usage of  conformational sampling tools in MOE.', 'Sodium hydrogen exchanger (SHE) inhibitor is one of the most important targets  in treatment of myocardial ischemia. In the course of our research into new  types of non-acylguanidine, SHE inhibitory activities of  5-tetrahydroquinolinylidine aminoguanidine derivatives were used to build  pharmacophore and 3D-QSAR models. Genetic Algorithm Similarity Program (GASP)  was used to derive a 3D pharmacophore model which was used in effective  alignment of data set. Eight molecules were selected on the basis of structure  diversity to build 10 different pharmacophore models. Model 1 was considered as  the best model as it has highest fitness score compared to other nine models.  The obtained model contained two acceptor sites, two donor atoms and one  hydrophobic region. Pharmacophore modeling was followed by substructure  searching and virtual screening. The best CoMFA model, representing steric and  electrostatic fields, obtained for 30 training set molecules was statistically  significant with cross-validated coefficient (q(2)) of 0.673 and conventional  coefficient (r(2)) of 0.988. In addition to steric and electrostatic fields  observed in CoMFA, CoMSIA also represents hydrophobic, hydrogen bond donor and  hydrogen bond acceptor fields. CoMSIA model was also significant with  cross-validated coefficient (q(2)) and conventional coefficient (r(2)) of 0.636  and 0.986, respectively. Both models were validated by an external test set of  eight compounds and gave satisfactory prediction (r(pred)(2)) of 0.772 and 0.701  for CoMFA and CoMSIA models, respectively. This pharmacophore based 3D-QSAR  approach provides significant insights that can be used to design novel, potent  and selective SHE inhibitors.', 'Recent technological breakthroughs in medicinal chemistry arena had ameliorated  the perspectives of quantitative structure-activity relationship (QSAR) methods.  In this direction, we developed a group-based QSAR method based on  pharmacophore-similarity concept which takes into account the 2D topological  pharmacophoric descriptors and predicts the group-specific biological  activities. This activity prediction may assist the contribution of certain  pharmacophore features encoded by respective fragments toward activity  improvement and/or detrimental effects. We termed this method as  pharmacophore-similarity-based QSAR (PS-QSAR) and studied the activity  contribution of fragments from 3-hydroxypyridinones derivatives possessing  antimalarial activities.']","A pharmacophore is an abstract description of molecular features which are necessary for molecular recognition of a ligand by a biological macromolecule. The IUPAC defines a pharmacophore to be ""an ensemble of steric and electronic features that is necessary to ensure the optimal supramolecular interactions with a specific biological target and to trigger (or block) its biological response"". A pharmacophore model explains how structurally diverse ligands can bind to a common receptor site. Furthermore pharmacophore models can be used to identify through denovo design or virtual screening novel ligands that will bind to the same receptor. Nowadays there are many programs suitable for pharmacophore modelling such as LigandScout, Discovery Studio, Catalyst, PharmaGist, Genetic Algorithm Similarity and Molecular Operating Environment."

This work was conducted targeting estimation of the  relative levels of total phenolic content, antioxidant potential and larvicidal  activity of 110 selected Egyptian plants. The highest total phenolic contents  were estimated in aqueous extracts of Coronilla scorpioides L., Forsskaolea  tenacissima L., Crataegus sinaica Boiss., Pistacia khinjuk Boiss. and Loranthus  acacia Benth.; they were 916.70 +/- 4.80, 813.70 +/- 4.16, 744.90 +/- 4.93,  549.00 +/- 3.93& 460.80 +/- 4.02 mg% while those of methanol extracts were  estimated in Coronilla scorpioides, Forsskaolea tenacissima, Crataegus sinaica,  Loranthus acacia and Pistacia khinjuk, they were 915.60-4.86, 664.60 +/- 4.16,  659.30 +/- 4.80, 590.80 +/- 4.49 & 588.00 +/- 3.85 mg% respectively.

They vary widely in  their basic ecology; each virus occupies a distinct ecologic niche, often with  restricted geographic and biologic distribution. As shown in Tables 54-1 and  54-2, alphaviruses and flaviviruses can cause various syndromes, ranging from  benign febrile illnesses to severe systemic diseases with hemorrhagic  manifestations or major organ involvement. The neurotropic alphaviruses and  flaviviruses can produce severe destructive central nervous system disease with  serious sequelae. Several alphaviruses (chikungunya, Mayaro, and Ross River)  cause painful arthritis that persists for weeks or months after the initial  febrile illness. Yellow fever virus has unique hepatotropic properties that  cause a clinically and pathologically distinct form of hepatitis with a  hemorrhagic diathesis. The dengue viruses, which cause more human illness than  all other members of their family, may produce a serious, sometimes fatal,  immunopathologic disease in which shock and hemorrhage occur. Hepatitis C virus  (Chapter 70) may be a flavivirus. Alphavirus is one of the two genera in the  family Togaviridae; the other genus (Rubivirus) has rubella virus (Chapter 55)  as its only member. Flavivirus, once classified in the Togaviridae, now  constitutes one of three genera in the family Flaviviridae; the other two genera  are Pestivirus and “Hepatitis C-like viruses”. Pestivirus includes animal  pathogens (bovine viral diarrhea and hog cholera viruses) that are of  considerable economic importance, but contains no known human pathogens.  Hepatitis C virus is described in Chapter 70. All alphaviruses and flaviviruses  that cause disease in humans are arthropod-borne viruses (arboviruses). In the  original classification scheme based on antigenic relationships, alphaviruses  and flaviviruses were termed group A and group B arboviruses, respectively. Most  alphaviruses and flaviviruses survive in nature by replicating alternately in a  vertebrate host and a hematophagous arthropod (mosquitoes or, for some  flaviviruses, ticks). Arthropod vectors acquire the viral infection by biting a  viremic host, and after an extrinsic incubation period during which the virus  replicates in the vector's tissues, they transmit virus through salivary  secretions to another vertebrate host. Virus replicates in the vertebrate host,  causing viremia and sometimes illness. The ability to infect and replicate in  both vertebrate and arthropod cells is an essential quality of alphaviruses and  flaviviruses. The principal vertebrate hosts for most are various species of  wild mammals or birds. The natural zoonotic cycles that maintain the virus do  not usually involve humans. However, a few viruses (yellow fever virus, dengue  virus types 1, 2, 3 and 4 and chikungunya virus) can be transmitted in a  human-mosquito-human cycle. As a result of being pathogenic for humans and  capable of transmission in heavily populated areas, these viruses can cause  widespread and serious epidemics. Because of their high transmission potential,  these viruses are major public health problems in many tropical and subtropical  regions of the world where appropriate mosquito vectors are present. Because  some of these agents are dangerous human pathogens and are highly infectious,  special containment and safety precautions in the laboratory are required."", 'Yellow fever (YF) is a viral disease, endemic to tropical regions of Africa and  the Americas, which principally affects humans and nonhuman primates and is  transmitted via the bite of infected mosquitoes. Yellow fever virus (YFV) can  cause devastating epidemics of potentially fatal, hemorrhagic disease. Despite  mass vaccination campaigns to prevent and control these outbreaks, the risk of  major YF epidemics, especially in densely populated, poor urban settings, both  in Africa and South America, has greatly increased. Consequently, YF is  considered an emerging, or reemerging disease of considerable importance. This  article comprehensively reviews the history, microbiology, epidemiology,  clinical presentation, diagnosis, and treatment of YFV, as well as the vaccines  produced to combat YF.', 'Vector-borne disease is one of the greatest contributors to human mortality and  morbidity throughout the tropics. Mosquito-transmitted diseases such as malaria,  dengue, yellow fever and filariasis are the main contributors to this burden.  Although insecticides have historically been used to try to control vector  populations, over the past 15 years, substantial progress has been made in  developing alternative vector control strategies ranging from biocontrol methods  through to genetic modification of wild insect populations. Here, we review  recent advances concerning these strategies and consider the potential  impediments to their deployment, including the challenges of obtaining  regulatory approval and community acceptance.', 'INTRODUCTION: Yellow fever is a serious illness public health importance and is  transmitted by mosquitoes of the genera Haemagogus and Sabethes in the rural and  forest environments, and by Aedes aegypti in the urban setting. In Colombia,  Haemagogus janthinomys and H. equinus are considered efficient vectors of this  viral disease. OBJECTIVE: The presence of the mosquito Haemagogus equinus was recorded over an  8 year period, in the periurban areas of the Soledad and Malambo municipalities  (Atlantico Province) of northern Colombia. MATERIALS AND METHODS: The data was obtained from records of the entomological  collections from two collection sites: (1) 14 larva traps located at the  Erneasto Cortissoz airport in the municipality of Soledad between 1997--2005 and  (2) 10 larva traps located at Vergara and Velasco Batallion in the municipality  of Malambo in 2005. RESULTS: Haemogogus equinus was reported for the first time in Soledad in 1998.  In the following 8 years, 197 larvae were reported. The individuals were found  sharing the trap with Aedes aegypti, Culex nigripalpus and Uranotaenia lowii. In  Malambo, the first discovery of H.equinus occurred in 2005, with a total of 641  larvae. No other Culicidae were associated with it. CONCLUSION: The presence of H. equinus in larvitraps located near the urban  zone, shows adaptation to the use of artificial containers as larval habitats,  Urbanization of this species in zones with a high Ae. aegypti infestation index  increases the potential introduction of sylvan yellow fever virus and  constitutes a risk for re-emergence of urban cycles of yellow fever.', 'Arboviruses differ from other viruses in their need to replicate in both  vertebrate and invertebrate hosts. The invertebrate is a blood-sucking arthropod  that is competent to transmit the virus between susceptible animals. Arboviruses  transmitted by ticks must adapt to the peculiar physiological and behavioral  characteristics of ticks, particularly with regard to blood feeding, bloodmeal  digestion, and molting. Virus imbibed with the blood meal first infects cells of  the midgut wall. During this phase the virus must contend with the heterophagic  bloodmeal digestion of ticks (an intracellular process occurring within midgut  cells) and overcome the as yet undefined ""gut barrier"" to infection. Genetic and  molecular data for a number of tick-borne viruses indicate ways in which such  viruses may have adapted to infecting ticks, but far more information is needed.  After infection of midgut cells, tick-borne viruses pass to the salivary glands  for transmission during the next blood-feeding episode. To do this, the virus  must survive molting by establishing an infection in at least one cell type that  does not undergo histolysis. Different tick-borne viruses have different  strategies for surviving the molting period, targeting a variety of tick  tissues. The infection can then persist for the life span of the tick with  little evidence of any detrimental effects on the tick. Transmission to a  vertebrate host during feeding most probably occurs via saliva that contains  virus secreted from infected salivary gland cells. The virus then enters the  skin site of feeding, which has been profoundly modified by the pharmacological  effects of tick saliva. At least three tick-borne viruses exploit such  tick-induced host changes. This phenomenon (saliva-activated transmission) is  believed to underlie ""nonviremic transmission,"" whereby a virus is transmitted  from an infected to an uninfected cofeeding tick through a host that has an  undetectable or very low viremia. Thus tick-borne viruses that have adapted to  the feeding characteristics of their tick vectors may not need to induce a  virulent infection (with high viremia) in their natural vertebrate hosts.  Efficient transmission of tick-borne viruses between cofeeding ticks may be a  means of amplifying virus infection prevalence in F1 generations infected by  transovarial transmission.', ""BACKGROUND: Health-care professionals can help travelers by providing accurate  pre-travel counseling for mosquito-transmitted diseases such as malaria, yellow  fever, and dengue fever. Governments and international organizations will  benefit from knowledge survey among health professionals in this field to  promote the development of travel health profession. This study investigates  physicians' and nurses' knowledge regarding malaria, yellow fever, and dengue  fever. METHODS: A cross-sectional questionnaire survey was distributed to physicians  and nurses in Taiwan interested in travel medicine between April and September  of 2008. The self-administered, single-choice questionnaire evaluated knowledge  regarding epidemiology, prophylactic medication for malaria, yellow fever, and  dengue fever, and vaccinations for yellow fever as well as background  information of participants. RESULTS: Complete information was collected from 82 physicians and 203 nurses.  (Out of 289, effective response rate = 99.9%). The mean percentage of accurate  responses was similar for all three diseases: malaria 67.3% (range,  16.8%-90.5%); yellow fever 65.4% (39.6%-79.3%); and dengue fever 74.4%  (14.4%-96.5%). The items with the lowest accuracy were (1) behavior of the  dengue fever vector Aedes aegypti mosquito (14.4%) and (2) incubation period of  malaria (16.8%). There were 60.4% participants who did not know the current  revaccination interval for the yellow fever vaccine. The average knowledge  scores for all three diseases were statistically significantly higher in the  physician group. CONCLUSIONS: Analysis of the results revealed significant deficits in travel  medicine knowledge among health-care providers. Emphasis on continuing medical  education for disease vector behavior, prophylactic drug prescription, and  preventative vaccination is important to travel safety. Health professionals in  Taiwan should actively participate in the International Society of Travel  Medicine to follow the international standard of travel medicine practitioners.  This type of survey should be adopted in other countries which would be helpful  in improving the quality of care for travelers."", 'For pathogens transmitted by biting vectors, one of the fundamental assumptions  is often that vector bites are the sole or main route of host infection. Here,  we demonstrate experimentally a transmission route whereby hosts (red grouse,  Lagopus lagopus scoticus) became infected with a member of the tick-borne  encephalitis virus complex, louping ill virus, after eating the infected tick  vector. Furthermore, we estimated from field observations that this mode of  infection could account for 73-98% of all virus infections in wild red grouse in  their first season. This has potential implications for the understanding of  other biting vector-borne pathogens where hosts may ingest vectors through  foraging or grooming.', 'Zika virus is a flavivirus transmitted by Aedes (Stegomyia) species of  mosquitoes. In May 2015, the World Health Organization confirmed the first local  transmission of Zika virus in the Americas in Brazil. The virus has spread  rapidly to other countries in the Americas; as of January 29, 2016, local  transmission has been detected in at least 22 countries or territories,  including the Commonwealth of Puerto Rico and the U.S. Virgin Islands. Zika  virus can infect pregnant women in all three trimesters. Although pregnant women  do not appear to be more susceptible to or more severely affected by Zika virus  infection, maternal-fetal transmission has been documented. Several pieces of  evidence suggest that maternal Zika virus infection is associated with adverse  neonatal outcomes, most notably microcephaly. Because of the number of countries  and territories with local Zika virus transmission, it is likely that obstetric  health care providers will care for pregnant women who live in or have traveled  to an area of local Zika virus transmission. We review information on Zika  virus, its clinical presentation, modes of transmission, laboratory testing,  effects during pregnancy, and methods of prevention to assist obstetric health  care providers in caring for pregnant women considering travel or with a history  of travel to areas with ongoing Zika virus transmission and pregnant women  residing in areas with ongoing Zika virus transmission.', 'Zika virus belongs to Aedes mosquito-borne flavivirus. In response to the  current cluster of congenital malformations (microcephaly) and other  neurological complications (Guillain-Barré Syndrome) that could be linked to  Zika virus infection, WHO declares that Zika virus is of global public health  importance. Data sources were from peer review articles and WHO documents. The  sources of Zika virus infection would include patients, people with asymptomatic  infections and primates. The infectious period of Zika virus remains unclear.  However, according to the period that RNA of Zika virus can be positively  detected in blood, saliva, urine or semen, we can presume that the communicable  period may last for 2 months or even longer. Zika virus is primarily transmitted  to humans by infected Aedes spp. mosquitoes. Presumptive vertical, blood or  sexual routes of transmission have been reported. More evidence indicated the  existence of a cause-effect relationship between Zika virus infection and  congenital microcephaly/Guillain-Barre syndrome. Strategies include successful  control the amount of mosquitoes and minimize the contacts between mosquitoes  and human beings could effectively prevent the Zika virus transmission. Other  preventive measures as cutting off vertical, blood or sexual routes of  transmission should also be adopted. The epidemiology of Zika virus remains  uncertain which calls for further research.']","Yellow fever virus is transmitted by mosquitoes and is restricted to Africa, Central and South America and the Caribbean. 
Yellow fever virus is a flavivirus, and there is only one antigenic type. It was taken to the Americas by the early slave traders, and nowadays reported in Africa, America, Asia and Europe. Yellow fever virus is transmitted by two different cycles: 
-from human to human by the mosquito Aedes aegypti; which is well-adapted to breeding around human habitations; the infection can be maintained in this way as ‘urban’ yellow fever.
-from infected monkeys to humans by mosquitoes such as Haemagogus. This is ‘jungle’ yellow fever and is seen in Africa and South America.

Yellow fever is not transmitted directly from human to human by day-to-day contact, but transmission from ill patients to healthcare workers has been reported, notably after needlestick injury."
109,What is evaluated with the SAD PERSONS scale?,"[""We examine the interrelations among clinicians' judgment of patients' suicide  risk, clinicians' emotional responses, and standard risk factors in the  short-term prediction of suicidal thoughts and behaviors. Psychiatric  outpatients (n\xa0=\xa0153) with a lifetime history of suicide ideation/attempt and  their treating clinicians (n\xa0=\xa067) were evaluated at intake. Clinicians  completed a standard suicide risk instrument (modified SAD PERSONS scale), a  10-point Likert scale assessment of judgment of patient suicide risk (Clinician  Prediction Scale), and a measure of their emotional responses to the patient  (Therapist Response Questionnaire-Suicide Form). The Columbia Suicide Severity  Rating Scale and the Beck Scale for Suicide Ideation were administered at a  one-month follow-up assessment (n\xa0=\xa0114, 74.5%). Clinician judgment of risk  significantly predicted suicidal thoughts and behaviors at follow-up. Both the  standard suicide risk instrument and clinician emotional responses contributed  independently to the clinician assessment of risk, which, in turn, mediated  their relationships with suicidal thoughts and behaviors. Our findings validate  the importance of clinical judgment in assessing suicide risk. Clinical judgment  appears to be informed both by concrete risk factors and clinicians' emotional  responses to suicidal patients, highlighting emotional awareness as a promising  area for research and training."", 'OBJECTIVES: The goal of this study was to evaluate the relationship between  various suicide screening tools and clinical impression with subsequent patient  psychiatric admission and near-term adverse emergency department (ED) events. METHODS: We performed a prospective observational study of 50 patients with  suicidal ideation in the ED. Subjects completed a series of depression/suicide  screening tools: the Columbia Suicide Severity Scale, SAD PERSONS scale, Patient  Health Questionnaire 9, and Beck Scale for Suicidal Ideation. Clinicians were  also asked about their impression on likelihood of patient admission. Outcome  measures were as follows: need for psychiatric hospital admission, prolonged  stay at psychiatric facility, and any adverse events during ED stay including  need for unscheduled psychiatric or sedating medications, need for physical  restraints, and need for intervention by security staff. RESULTS: The Beck Scale for Suicidal Ideation, Patient Health Questionnaire 9,  and Columbia Suicide Severity Scale did not significantly predict within-ED  adverse events or admissions to psychiatric facilities. Wald test for individual  parameters at an α of .10 level found that patients who were screened positive  by their nurse had 3.37 times the odds of adverse within-ED events; patients  with a positive SAD PERSONS score had 8.18 times the odds of psychiatric  admission greater than 5 days. However, at the α of .05 level, no screening  tools correlated with patient ED course or likelihood of psychiatric admission. CONCLUSION: Clinical impression alone and the suicide screening tools showed  poor predictive value for near-term events. Data from this study highlight the  need for the development of ED-based suicide screening instruments capable of  identifying those patients with suicidal ideation at greatest risk.', 'BACKGROUND: Past and repeated self-harm are long-term risks to completed  suicide. A brief rating scale to assess repetition risk of self-harm is  important for high-risk identification and early interventions in suicide  prevention. The study aimed to examine the validity of the Chinese SAD PERSONS  Scale (CSPS) and to evaluate its feasibility in clinical settings. METHODS: One hundred and forty-seven patients with self-harm were recruited from  the Emergency Department and assessed at baseline and the sixth month. The  controls, 284 people without self-harm from the Family Medicine Department in  the same hospital were recruited and assessed concurrently. The psychometric  properties of the CSPS were examined using baseline and follow-up measurements  that assessed a variety of suicide risk factors. Clinical feasibility and  applicability of the CSPS were further evaluated by a group of general nurses  who used case vignette approach in CSPS risk assessment in clinical settings. An  open-ended question inquiring their opinions of scale adaptation to hospital  inpatient assessment for suicide risks were also analyzed using content  analysis. RESULTS: The CSPS was significantly correlated with other scales measuring  depression, hopelessness and suicide ideation. A cut-off point of the scale was  at 4/5 in predicting 6-month self-harm repetition with the sensitivity and  specificity being 65.4% and 58.1%, respectively. Based on the areas under the  Receiver Operating Characteristic curves, the predictive validity of the scale  showed a better performance than the other scales. Fifty-four nurses, evaluating  the scale using case vignette found it a useful tool to raise the awareness of  suicide risk and a considerable tool to be adopted into nursing care. CONCLUSIONS: The Chinese SAD PERSONS Scale is a brief instrument with acceptable  psychometric properties for self-harm prediction. However, cautions should be  paid to level of therapeutic relationships during assessment, staff workload and  adequate training for wider clinical applications.', 'Conflict of interest statement: ETHICS APPROVAL AND CONSENT TO PARTICIPATE: The  self-harm monitoring system in Oxford was approved by South Central – Berkshire  National Research Ethics Service and Derbyshire Research Ethics Committee  approved the study in Derby.

We aimed to evaluate the evidence for these instruments including  assessment of risk of bias and diagnostic accuracy for suicide and suicide  attempt. METHODS: PubMed (NLM), PsycInfo, Embase, Cinahl and the Cochrane Library  databases were searched until December 2014. We assessed risk of bias with  QUADAS-2. The average sensitivity and specificity of each instrument was  estimated and the certainty of the evidence was assessed with GRADE. We  considered instruments with a sensitivity > 80% and a specificity > 50% to have  sufficient diagnostic accuracy. RESULTS: Thirty-five relevant studies were identified but 14 were considered to  have high risk of bias, leaving 21 studies evaluating altogether 15 risk  assessment instruments. We could carry out meta-analyses for five instruments.  For the outcome suicide attempt SAD PERSONS Scale had a sensitivity of 15% (95%  CI 8-24) and specificity of 97% (96-98), and the Manchester Self-Harm Rule  (MSHR) a sensitivity of 97% (97-97) and a specificity of 20% (20-21). ReACT,  which is a modification of MSHR, had a similar low specificity, as did the  Sodersjukhuset Self Harm Rule. For the outcome suicide, the Beck Hopelessness  Scale had a sensitivity of 89% (78-95) and specificity of 42% (40-43). CONCLUSIONS: Most suicide risk assessment instruments were supported by too few  studies to allow for evaluation of accuracy. Among those that could be  evaluated, none fulfilled requirements for sufficient diagnostic accuracy.', 'OBJECTIVE: Both depression and anxiety have been associated with poor prognosis  in patients with acute coronary syndrome (ACS). However, certain symptoms and  how they are measured may be more important than others. We investigated three  different scales to determine their predictive validity. METHODS: Patients with ACS (N = 598) completed either the Hospital Anxiety and  Depression Scales (HADS-A, HADS-D; n = 316) or the Beck Depression  Inventory-Fast Screen (n = 282). Their all-cause mortality status was assessed  at 8 years. RESULTS: During follow-up, 20% (121/598) of participants died. Cox proportional  hazards modeling showed that the HADS-D was predictive of mortality (hazard  ratio [HR] = 1.11, 95% confidence interval [CI] = 1.04-1.19), and this  association remained significant after adjustment for major clinical/demographic  factors, whereas the HADS-A (HR = 0.96, 95% CI = 0.85-1.09) and the Beck  Depression Inventory-Fast Screen (HR = 0.99, 95% CI = 0.91-1.08) were not. The  following depression items from the HADS-D predicted mortality: ""I still enjoy  the things I used to enjoy"" (HR = 1.38, 95% CI = 1.05-1.82), ""I can laugh and  see the funny side of things"" (HR = 1.48, 95% CI = 1.11-1.96), ""I feel as if I  am slowed down"" (HR = 1.66, 95% CI = 1.24-2.22), and ""I look forward with  enjoyment to things"" (HR = 1.36, 95% CI = 1.08-1.72). CONCLUSIONS: Depressive symptoms related to lack of enjoyment or pleasure and  physical or cognitive slowing, as measured by the HADS-D, predicted all-cause  mortality at 8 years ACS patients, whereas other depressive and anxiety symptoms  did not. Whether symptoms of distress predict prognosis in ACS seems to be  dependent on the measures and items used.', 'Mal de Debarquement Syndrome is a neurological disorder of motion perception,  triggered by external motion. This study aimed to determine the importance of  psychosocial factors in relation to depression and quality of life in Mal de  Debarquement Syndrome. A total of 66 participants with self-reported Mal de  Debarquement Syndrome completed quality-of-life, symptom severity, stigma,  depression, and illness intrusiveness measurements in this naturalistic  correlational study. Mal de Debarquement Syndrome was associated with high  levels of depression and illness intrusiveness. Illness intrusiveness mediated  between stigma and quality of life; also the level of stigma moderated the  effect of illness intrusiveness on quality of life. Targeted interventions aimed  at alleviating psychological distress may improve quality of life in Mal de  Debarquement Syndrome.', 'BACKGROUND: Confounding of depression with somatic illness and anxiety, a  problem in any age group, may be especially troublesome in frail older persons.  This paper examined this problem in a factor analytic study of the structure of  depressive symptomatology, identifying affective and somatic symptom clusters  and relating those clusters to health and functional variables cross-sectionally  and prospectively over a 1-year interval. METHODS: The factor structure of a DSM-IV symptom checklist was examined among  1,245 elderly long-term care residents. Regression analyses examined the  association of resulting factors with cognition, functional disability, self-  and physician-rated health, and pain at baseline and a year later. One-year  mortality was also examined. RESULTS: Factor analysis revealed three unique symptom clusters: depressed mood,  somatic symptoms, and psychic anxiety. Depressed mood and somatic symptoms were  associated cross-sectionally with all functional health variables, but psychic  anxiety was associated only with pain. Longitudinally, depressed mood was the  only independent predictor of decline in cognition, functional ability,  physician-rated health, and mortality; the last effect, however, did not  withstand control for baseline health and functioning. Somatic symptoms at  baseline predicted decrement in self-rated health a year later. Effects varied  as a function of cognitive status. CONCLUSIONS: These data suggest that concerns about the confounding role of  somatic symptoms in the association of depression with physical health are  unfounded. Although somatic symptoms of depression and anxiety were associated  with health and functional status cross-sectionally, depressed mood was by far  the stronger predictor of health declines over time.', 'OBJECTIVE: To determine which screening instrument is most suitable for  detecting depression in Chinese stroke patients. METHOD: A random sample of 60 Chinese subjects recruited from consecutively  admitted patients with first-ever stroke to a rehabilitation facility were  assessed using the Visual Analogue Mood Scale (VAMS), the Hospital Anxiety and  Depression Scale (HADS), and the Geriatric Depression Scale (GDS). Psychiatric  diagnoses, which served as a benchmark for the comparison of screening  instruments, were made using the SCID-DSM-III-R. Rating instruments were  compared with respect to response rate, sensitivity, specificity, positive and  negative predictive values, and receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curves. RESULTS: The VAMS was not useful in screening for depression in Chinese stroke  patients while both the HADS and the GDS demonstrated satisfactory accuracy in  detecting depression in Chinese stroke patients. CONCLUSIONS: Screening instruments for poststroke depression are  culture-specific and even scales well established in other cultures should be  tested before being used in clinical practice and research.', ""PURPOSE: The purpose of this paper is to assess the reliability and validity of  the Spanish version of the Davidson trauma scale (DTS-S) and to determine the  prevalence and correlates of post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) symptoms in a  non-clinical random sample of prison inmates. DESIGN/METHODOLOGY/APPROACH: Probabilistic samples of 1,179 inmates from 26  penal institutions in Puerto Rico were selected using a multistage sampling  design. Population estimates and correlations were obtained for PTSD,  generalized anxiety and depression. The reliability, factor structure, and  convergent validity of the DTS-S were assessed. Cross-validation was employed to  confirm the results of the factor analyses. FINDINGS: Using the cut-offs adopted by the scale's author, 136 (13.4 percent)  of the inmates are likely to have current PTSD and 117 (11.6 percent) reach the  cut-off for sub-threshold PTSD. Confirmatory factor analysis generated two  factors explaining 53 percent of the variance. High reliabilities were obtained  for the total scale (α=0.95) and for the frequency and severity scales (α=0.90  and 0.91). Significantly higher DTS-S scores were found for females (t=2.26,  p<0.025), for inmates diagnosed with depression or anxiety (t=2.02, p<0.05), and  those reporting suicide attempts (t=4.47, p<0.0001). ORIGINALITY/VALUE: Findings support that the DTS-S is a reliable and valid  measure to assess PTSD symptoms in Latino inmate populations and to identify  individuals at risk for the disorder that require confirmatory diagnosis and  clinical interventions.""]",SAD PERSONS scale was developed to evaluate suicide risk.
110,Which are the components of the pre-replication complex (pre-RC) in eukaryotes?,"['During pre-replication complex (pre-RC) formation, origin recognition complex  (ORC), Cdc6, and Cdt1 cooperatively load the 6-subunit mini chromosome  maintenance (MCM2-7) complex onto DNA. Loading of MCM2-7 is a prerequisite for  DNA licensing that restricts DNA replication to once per cell cycle. During S  phase MCM2-7 functions as part of the replicative helicase but within the pre-RC  MCM2-7 is inactive. The organization of replicative DNA helicases before and  after loading onto DNA has been studied in bacteria and viruses but not  eukaryotes and is of major importance for understanding the MCM2-7 loading  mechanism and replisome assembly. Lack of an efficient reconstituted pre-RC  system has hindered the detailed mechanistic and structural analysis of MCM2-7  loading for a long time. We have reconstituted Saccharomyces cerevisiae pre-RC  formation with purified proteins and showed efficient loading of MCM2-7 onto  origin DNA in vitro. MCM2-7 loading was found to be dependent on the presence of  all pre-RC proteins, origin DNA, and ATP hydrolysis. The quaternary structure of  MCM2-7 changes during pre-RC formation: MCM2-7 before loading is a single  hexamer in solution but is transformed into a double-hexamer during pre-RC  formation. Using electron microscopy (EM), we observed that loaded MCM2-7  encircles DNA. The loaded MCM2-7 complex can slide on DNA, and sliding is not  directional. Our results provide key insights into mechanisms of pre-RC  formation and have important implications for understanding the role of the  MCM2-7 in establishment of bidirectional replication forks.', 'Chromosomal DNA replication is one of the central biological events occurring  inside cells. Due to its large size, the replication of genomic DNA in  eukaryotes initiates at hundreds to tens of thousands of sites called DNA  origins so that the replication could be completed in a limited time. Further,  eukaryotic DNA replication is sophisticatedly regulated, and this regulation  guarantees that each origin fires once per S phase and each segment of DNA gets  duplication also once per cell cycle. The first step of replication initiation  is the assembly of pre-replication complex (pre-RC). Since 1973, four proteins,  Cdc6/Cdc18, MCM, ORC and Cdt1, have been extensively studied and proved to be  pre-RC components. Recently, a novel pre-RC component called Sap1/Girdin was  identified. Sap1/Girdin is required for loading Cdc18/Cdc6 to origins for pre-RC  assembly in the fission yeast and human cells, respectively. At the transition  of G1 to S phase, pre-RC is activated by the two kinases, cyclindependent kinase  (CDK) and Dbf4-dependent kinase (DDK), and subsequently, RPA, primase-polα,  PCNA, topoisomerase, Cdc45, polδ, and polɛ are recruited to DNA origins for  creating two bi-directional replication forks and initiating DNA replication. As  replication forks move along chromatin DNA, they frequently stall due to the  presence of a great number of replication barriers on chromatin DNA, such as  secondary DNA structures, protein/DNA complexes, DNA lesions, gene  transcription. Stalled forks must require checkpoint regulation for their  stabilization. Otherwise, stalled forks will collapse, which results in  incomplete DNA replication and genomic instability. This short review gives a  concise introduction regarding the current understanding of replication  initiation and replication fork stabilization.', 'The origin recognition complex 1 (ORC1) is the largest subunit of the ORC, the  heteromeric hexamer. ORC1 is an essential component of the pre-replicative  complex (pre-RC) that licenses eukaryote DNA replication origins. The levels of  ORC1 fluctuate during the mitotic cell cycle in Drosophila as well as in some  human cells. Proteolysis of ORC1 occurs at the end of M phase in Drosophila,  which is mediated by the anaphase-promoting complex (APC), and in late S phase  in human cells by Skip-Cullin-F box (SCF). Previously we showed that proteolysis  of ORC1 by APC is mediated by the ORC1 destruction box (the O-box), an APC motif  conserved among species yet distinct from the D-box or KEN-box. Recently we  showed that replacing the O-box with the D-box (ORC1O→D) changes the degradation  profile of ORC1 during a canonical cell cycle. Here we report further  characterization of the ORC1O→D allele that turned out to be a useful tool to  examine the function of ORC1 in other modes of DNA replication during oogenesis.  In endoreplication stages ORC1O→D does not change any DNA content profiles,  consistent with our previous finding that ORC is dispensable for  endoreplication. However, in amplification stage replication efficiency of  ORC1O→D is drastically reduced, which resulted in amplification defects that led  to thin egg shell phenotype. Taken together, our analyses show that orc1 allele  newly identified is female sterile and possesses a unique feature of phenotypes  that are distinct in different modes of DNA replication.', 'Mcm10 has recently been found to play a crucial role in multiple steps of the  DNA replication initiation process in eukaryotes. Here, we have examined the  role of Mcm10 in assembling initiation factors at a well-characterized yeast  replication origin, ARS1. We find that the pre-replication complex (pre-RC)  components Cdc6 and Mcm7 associate with ARS1 in the mcm10-1 mutant, suggesting  that establishment of the pre-RC is not compromised in this mutant. Association  of Cdc45 with ARS1 is reduced in the mcm10-1 mutant, suggesting that Mcm10 is  involved in recruiting Cdc45 to the pre-RC. We find that overexpression of  either Mcm10-1 or Cdc45 suppresses the growth defect of mcm10-1, and that a  physical interaction between Cdc45 and Mcm10 is disrupted in the mcm10-1 mutant.  Our results show that interaction between the Mcm10 and Cdc45 proteins  facilitates the recruitment of Cdc45 onto the ARS1 origin.', 'Replication of eukaryotic genomes is limited to once per cell cycle, by a  two-step mechanism. DNA replication origins are first ""licensed"" during G1 phase  by loading of an inactive DNA helicase (Mcm2-7) into pre-replicative complexes  (pre-RCs). Initiation then occurs during S phase, triggered by cyclin-dependent  kinases (CDKs), which promote recruitment of proteins required for helicase  activation and replisome assembly. CDKs and the anaphase promoting  complex/cyclosome (APC/C) restrict licensing to G1 phase by directly and  indirectly regulating pre-RC components, including ORC, Cdc6, Cdt1, and Mcm2-7.  Despite the fundamental importance of licensing regulation, the mechanisms by  which pre-RC components are regulated differ widely across Eukarya. Here we show  that even within the genus Saccharomyces, Cdc6 is regulated differently in  different species. We propose that two factors contribute to the rapid evolution  of licensing regulation. The first is redundancy: eliminating any single  pre-RC-regulatory mechanism has very little affect on viability. The second is  interchangeability: we show that regulatory mechanisms can be swapped between  pre-RC components without compromising the block to re-replication. These  experiments provide a framework for understanding the diversity of licensing  regulation in eukaryotes and provide new tools for manipulating the  chromosome-replication cycle.', 'The Rif1 protein, originally identified as a telomere-binding factor in yeast,  has recently been implicated in DNA replication control from yeast to metazoans.  Here, we show that budding yeast Rif1 protein inhibits activation of  prereplication complexes (pre-RCs). This inhibitory function requires two  N-terminal motifs, RVxF and SILK, associated with recruitment of PP1 phosphatase  (Glc7). In G1 phase, we show both that Glc7 interacts with Rif1 in an  RVxF/SILK-dependent manner and that two proteins implicated in pre-RC  activation, Mcm4 and Sld3, display increased Dbf4-dependent kinase (DDK)  phosphorylation in rif1 mutants. Rif1 also interacts with Dbf4 in yeast  two-hybrid assays, further implicating this protein in direct modulation of  pre-RC activation through the DDK. Finally, we demonstrate Rif1 RVxF/SILK  motif-dependent recruitment of Glc7 to telomeres and earlier replication of  these regions in cells where the motifs are mutated. Our data thus link Rif1 to  negative regulation of replication origin firing through recruitment of the Glc7  phosphatase.', 'Eukaryotic chromosomal DNA replication is controlled by a highly ordered series  of steps involving multiple proteins at replication origins. The eukaryotic GINS  complex is essential for the establishment of DNA replication forks and  replisome progression. GINS is one of the core components of the eukaryotic  replicative helicase, the CMG (Cdc45-MCM-GINS) complex, which unwinds duplex DNA  ahead of the moving replication fork. Eukaryotic GINS also links with other key  proteins at the fork to maintain an active replisome progression complex.  Archaeal GINS homologues play a central role in chromosome replication by  associating with other replisome components. This chapter focuses on the  molecular events related with DNA replication initiation, and summarizes our  current understanding of the function, structure and evolution of the GINS  complex in eukaryotes and archaea.', 'The origin recognition complex 1 (ORC1) is the largest subunit of the ORC, the  heteromeric hexamer.

Two other proteins, Mcm8 and Mcm9, with significant  homology to Mcm2-7 were first shown to play distinct roles during DNA  replication in Xenopus laevis egg extract. Recent work has revealed that Mcm8  and 9 form a complex that plays a role during homologous recombination in human,  chicken and mouse cells. We have therefore re-examined the behavior of the  Xenopus homologs of these proteins. We show that Mcm8 and Mcm9 form a dimeric  complex in Xenopus egg extract. They both associate with chromatin at later  stages of DNA replication, and this association is stimulated by DNA damage,  suggesting that their function is analogous to the one described in higher  eukaryotes. In contrast to previous reports, we do not find Mcm9 essential for  loading of Mcm2-7 complex onto chromatin during origin licensing nor detect its  interaction with Cdt1 origin licensing factor. Altogether, we conclude that the  role Mcm8 and Mcm9 play in Xenopus egg extract is not different from recent  findings in higher eukaryotes, consistent with an evolutionary conservation of  their function.', 'Eukaryotic cells license each DNA replication origin during G1 phase by  assembling a prereplication complex that contains a Mcm2-7 (minichromosome  maintenance proteins 2-7) double hexamer. During S phase, each Mcm2-7 hexamer  forms the core of a replicative DNA helicase. However, the mechanisms of origin  licensing and helicase activation are poorly understood. The helicase loaders  ORC-Cdc6 function to recruit a single Cdt1-Mcm2-7 heptamer to replication  origins prior to Cdt1 release and ORC-Cdc6-Mcm2-7 complex formation, but how the  second Mcm2-7 hexamer is recruited to promote double-hexamer formation is not  well understood. Here, structural evidence for intermediates consisting of an  ORC-Cdc6-Mcm2-7 complex and an ORC-Cdc6-Mcm2-7-Mcm2-7 complex are reported,  which together provide new insights into DNA licensing. Detailed structural  analysis of the loaded Mcm2-7 double-hexamer complex demonstrates that the two  hexamers are interlocked and misaligned along the DNA axis and lack ATP  hydrolysis activity that is essential for DNA helicase activity. Moreover, we  show that the head-to-head juxtaposition of the Mcm2-7 double hexamer generates  a new protein interaction surface that creates a multisubunit-binding site for  an S-phase protein kinase that is known to activate DNA replication. The data  suggest how the double hexamer is assembled and how helicase activity is  regulated during DNA licensing, with implications for cell cycle control of DNA  replication and genome stability.']","The components of the pre-replication complex (pre-RC) in eukaryotes are:

111,"List co-morbidities that may occur together with ""Stiff man Syndrome""","[""OBJECTIVE: To report an association between two autoimmune conditions, Graves'  disease and stiff-person (stiff-man) syndrome, and discuss the relevant  literature. METHODS: We present a case of a 52-year-old white woman with stiff-person  syndrome who also had Graves' disease, discuss her management, and review the  related literature. Pertinent published reports from 1950 through 2004 were  researched with use of MEDLINE and PubMed, and cross-references to other  articles were reviewed. RESULTS: A 52-year-old white woman presented with symptoms of hyperthyroidism  due to Graves' disease. Laboratory data were as follows: thyrotropin <0.005 m  IU/mL, thyroxine 11.1 microg/dL, free thyroxine index (FTI) 10.7, and  triiodothyronine 170 ng/dL. Thyroid-stimulating immunoglobulins (TSI) and  thyrotropin-binding inhibitory immunoglobulins (TBII) were positive at 1,986%  and 82.5 U/L, respectively. The hyperthyroidism was treated with propranolol.  She had a long-standing history of musculoskeletal complaints and was ultimately  diagnosed with stiff-person syndrome. During her thyroid evaluation, she had  severe neurologic deterioration that necessitated hospitalization and treatment  with clonazepam, baclofen, intravenous immunoglobulin, and subsequently  prednisone and azathioprine for appreciable symptomatic relief. The aggressive  immunosuppression had a profound effect on her symptoms of hyperthyroidism,  results of thyroid function tests, and thyrotropin receptor antibodies (TRABs).  Thyrotropin was 0.52 microIU/mL, thyroxine was 6.9 microg/dL, and FTI was 5.7.  The TSI decreased from 1,986% to 248%, and her TBII normalized from 82.5 U/L to  <5 U/L. She was clinically and biochemically euthyroid at last follow-up in May  2004. CONCLUSION: This case illustrates the association between TRAB-positive Graves'  disease and stiff-person syndrome and the improvement of Graves' disease with  immunosuppressive therapy."", 'Stiff-man syndrome (SMS) is a rare disorder of the central nervous system of  probable autoimmune origin. Patients with SMS often have other autoimmune  diseases, in particular type I (insulin-dependent) diabetes mellitus (IDDM).  Approximately 60% of patients with SMS have high titers of autoantibodies  against the enzyme glutamic acid decarboxylase. Similar to SMS, the majority of  patients with IDDM have autoantibodies against glutamic acid decarboxylase at or  before diabetes onset, although usually at a lower titer and with a different  reaction pattern than patients with SMS. To investigate the immunogenetic basis  of SMS, we HLA-typed 18 patients with the disease. Seventy-two percent carried  the DQB1*0201 allele (13 of 18, P = 0.02 vs. 18 of 48 controls), indicating that  SMS is associated with this allele. DQB1*0201 is also a susceptibility allele  for IDDM and other autoimmune diseases. Patients with SMS carried the  IDDM-protective DQB1*0602 allele and other sequence-related DQB1*06 alleles with  the same frequency observed in controls. In contrast, these alleles are rarely  found in IDDM. Five of 8 (62.5%) SMS patients lacking a DQB1*06 allele were  diabetic in contrast to only 2 of 10 (20%) with a DQB1*06 allele (P = 0.08),  suggesting that the presence of DQB1*0602 or other DQB1*06 alleles may be  associated with a reduced prevalence of diabetes among patients with SMS.', 'We report a patient who developed stiff-man syndrome, including disabling  shoulder subluxation and wrist ankylosis, in association with breast cancer.  Immunologic investigations disclosed autoimmunity directed against not only  glutamic acid decarboxylase but also amphiphysin, a 128-kd protein located in  the presynaptic compartment of neurons. The patient improved after surgery and  corticosteroid treatment and has been stable for nearly 4 years on only  anti-estrogenics. The triad of stiff-man syndrome, breast cancer, and  autoantibodies against amphiphysin identifies a new autoimmune paraneoplastic  syndrome of the CNS.', 'Glutamic acid decarboxylase (GAD) catalyzes the biosynthesis of the inhibitory  neurotransmitter gamma-aminobutyric acid (GABA). GAD has been suggested as an  autoantigen in insulin-dependent diabetes mellitus and stiff-man syndrome.  Recently, three forms of membrane-associated GAD (MGAD) have been characterized  in porcine brain, but the subcellular localization and function of these  proteins are unknown. We present evidence that GAD activity is associated with  synaptic vesicles from porcine brain. These vesicles contain a 60 kDa protein  recognized by serum from patients with insulin-dependent diabetes mellitus,  probably MGADII, as shown by subcellular fractionation and immunoblotting. These  results raise the possibility that the association of MGADII with synaptic  vesicles may be crucial for its role as an autoantigen in insulin-dependent  diabetes mellitus.', 'Autoantibodies to glutamic acid decarboxylase (GAD) are an important marker of  the autoimmune-mediated beta-cell destruction in insulin-dependent (Type I)  diabetes. However, these autoantibodies are also found in patients with  Stiff-man syndrome (SMS) without onset of diabetes and some diabetic patients  who initially present as non-insulin dependent (Type II) diabetes later becoming  insulin-dependent, called as latent autoimmune diabetes in adults (LADA). To  study the immune response to GAD in these LADA patients a competitive  radiobinding assay based on murine monoclonal antibodies recognizing three  different GAD regions was performed. The monoclonal antibodies against GAD  recognize two different linear epitopes localized at the N- (amino acids 4-17)  and C-terminus (amino acids 572-585) and one conformation-dependent epitope  region (amino acids 221-442 IDDM-E1) known to be immunodominant for  diabetes-associated autoantibodies. All LADA sera (20/20) reduced substantially  the 125I-GAD binding of the monoclonal antibodies reactive with the  conformation-dependent epitope region IDDM-E1 and only 20% of these sera  additionally diminished the 125I-GAD65 binding by those monoclonals reactive  with the both linear epitopes. The SMS sera completely abolished the GAD binding  of all three monoclonals, reflecting a broader repertoire including an immune  response against the IDDM-E1, a conformation-dependent GAD65 epitope region,  also revealed if the SMS sera are diluted to equivalent antibody concentrations.  In summary, our results show that diabetes-associated GAD autoantibodies even in  adult patients with a late autoimmune process preferentially recognize a  conformation-dependent middle GAD65 region. An immune response to all three GAD  epitope regions is seldom in these LADA patients and only detectable in  association with high antibody titres.', 'BACKGROUND AND INTRODUCTION: In 1991, a deceased human male was found frozen in  a glacier pool in the Italian Alps in north west Italy, and is now carefully  preserved in the South Tyrol Museum of Archaeology, in Bolzano, Italy. The  bodily tissues of the 5,300 year old male (colloquially referred to as the  Iceman or Ötzi) were well preserved despite damage related to freezing, and  glacial movement. Associated articles of well-preserved clothing, tools, weapons  and other devices were also present and have been studied in detail. Clinical  examination and imaging investigations have also shown that the Icemen had  experienced possible illnesses in his lifetime and had identifiable areas of  arthritis and musculoskeletal injury. This report includes some key observations  on the musculoskeletal state of Ötzi and reference to the involvement of tattoo  markings. Some aspects about the aetiology of his abnormalities and inflammatory  arthritis are considered along with possible treatments that he might have  employed. METHODS AND RESULTS: We (WFK and MK) undertook a clinical musculoskeletal  examination of the Iceman, details of which with available photographs and  radiographic imaging pertaining to the musculoskeletal findings of the Iceman  are reported here. The skin of the Iceman has numerous linear carbon tattoos,  which are not of a decorative type. These have been presumed to possibly be  ""medicinal"" tattoos administered for therapeutic reasons and may have been used  in acupuncture-like treatment of pain. Spinal imaging identified areas of spinal  damage and our observations have provided clues as to possible sites of spinal  initiated pain and hence sites for administration of the ""medicinal"" tattoos. We  observed body areas of the Iceman, in which imaging demonstrated arthritis and  other forms of long-term musculoskeletal damage, but which do not have adjacent  or corresponding ""medicinal"" tattoos. We contend that the back and leg  ""medicinal"" tattoos correspond directly to sites of chronic right knee and right  ankle pain, and left thoracolumbar pain. They also correspond to lower lumbar  and sciatic referred radicular pain which may have a contributory cause related  to the presence of a transitional lumbar 5 vertebra. Using recent published data  (Keller et al. in Nature Commun 3:698, 2012. doi: 10.1038/ncomms1701 ) of the  genome structure of the Iceman, we suggest some potential causes of the  osteoarthritis or inflammatory joint injury may relate to presence of coronary  heart disease (CHD) and Lyme disease (Borrelia burgdorferi) infection. We  speculate on possible medical applications of natural products for  self-medication. CONCLUSIONS: These observations highlight several diagnostic features of  musculoskeletal conditions in the Iceman with the possibility that tattoos may  have been used for diagnosis or location of his painful states. The origins of  his musculoskeletal conditions are unclear but there are indications that Lyme  disease and CHD may have been factors. The associations or use of natural  products may give insights into their applications at the time of the life of  the Iceman.', 'Guillain-Barré syndrome (GBS) is a potentially life-threatening immune-mediated  acute inflammatory polyneuropathy associated with several antecedent infections.  We report a 20-year-old man with GBS associated with concurrent leptospirosis  and scrub typhus infection. GBS was confirmed with clinical examination and  nerve conduction studies. There have been case reports of GBS in association  with Leptospira and Orienta tsusugamushi separately. However, this may be the  first case report of GBS associated with concurrent diseases.', 'Mal de debarquement (MdD) is a subjective perception of self-motion after  exposure to passive motion, in most cases sea travel, hence the name. Mal de  debarquement occurs quite frequently in otherwise healthy individuals for a  short period of time (several hours). However, in some people symptoms remain  for a longer period of time or even persist and this is then called mal de  debarquement syndrome (MdDS). The underlying pathogenesis is poorly understood  and therefore, treatment options are limited. In general, limited studies have  focused on the topic, but the past few years more and more interest has been  attributed to MdDS and its facets, which is reflected by an increasing number of  papers. Till date, some interesting reviews on the topic have been published,  but a systematic review of the literature is lacking and could help to address  the shortcomings and flaws of the current literature. We here present a  systematic review of MdD(S) based on a systematic search of medical databases  employing predefined criteria, using the terms ""mal de debarquement"" and ""sea  legs"". Based on this, we suggest a list of criteria that could aid healthcare  professionals in the diagnosis of MdDS. Further research needs to address the  blank gaps by addressing how prevalent MdD(S) really is, by digging deeper into  the underlying pathophysiology and setting up prospective, randomized  placebo-controlled studies to evaluate the effectiveness of possible treatment  strategies.', 'Ehlers-Danlos syndromes (EDS) are a heterogeneous group of hereditary connective  tissue disorders characterized by joint hypermobility, widespread  musculoskeletal pain and tissue fragility. Psychiatric disorders and  psychosocial impairment are common, yet poorly characterized, findings in EDS  patients. We investigated the frequency and types of psychiatric disorders and  their relationship to systemic manifestations in a cohort of 106 classic and  hypermobility type EDS patients. In this retrospective study, extensive medical  chart review was performed for patients referred at two genetics clinics who  were diagnosed with EDS. Statistical analysis was undertaken to determine the  frequency of psychiatric disorders and association with systemic findings.  Psychiatric disorders were found in 42.5% of the EDS cohort, with 22.7% of  patients affected with 2 or more psychiatric diagnoses. Anxiety and depression  were most commonly reported, with frequencies of 23.6 and 25.5%, respectively. A  variety of other psychiatric diagnoses were also identified. Abdominal pain  [odds ratio (OR) 7.38], neuropathic pain (OR 4.07), migraines (OR 5.21), joint  pain (OR 2.85) and fatigue (OR 5.55) were significantly associated with the  presence of a psychiatric disorder. The presence of any pain symptom was  significantly associated with having a psychiatric disorder (OR 9.68). Muscle  pain (OR 2.79), abdominal pain (OR 5.78), neuropathic pain (OR 3.91), migraines  (OR 2.63) and fatigue (OR 3.78) were significantly associated with having an  anxiety or mood disorder. Joint hypermobility and the classic dermatological  features of EDS showed no significant association with having a psychiatric  disorder. Our findings demonstrate a high frequency of psychiatric disorders and  an association with pain symptoms in EDS.', ""A 39-year-old man acutely developed diplopia, vertigo, unsteady gait, and  disturbance of consciousness following an upper respiratory infection.  Neurological examination showed ophthalmoplegia, facial paralysis, tetraplegia  and loss of deep tendon reflexes. Babinski reflex was positive on the left and  there were bilateral flexor withdrawal reflexes. He also developed ballism-like  involuntary movements in all extremities, loss of proprioception predominantly  on the left, and severe truncal ataxia. Anti-GQ1b IgG antibody was selectively  elevated in serum, and CSF protein was elevated to 53 mg/dl with cell count of  12/mm3. Nerve conduction study showed decreased amplitude of compound motor  action potentials in all extremities, and no response in facial muscles. Cranial  MRI showed no abnormalities whereas EEG was severely abnormal with lack of  posterior dominant rhythm and the presence of continuous diffuse theta-waves.  This case presented clinical characteristics of three syndromes  concurrently-Fisher syndrome, Bickerstaff brainstem encephalitis, and  Guillain-Barré syndrome-that may be collectively called 'anti-GQ1b IgG antibody  syndrome'. The unique feature of the present case was development of deep coma  and ballism-like movements, associated with selective increase of serum  anti-GQ1b IgG antibody. It is thus conceivable that anti-GQ1b IgG antibody might  underlie the pathogenesis of all three conditions.""]","SMS (Stiff man Syndrome) is is a rare disorder of the central nervous system of probable autoimmune origin and as such is associated with other autoimmune diseases, such as Insulin Dependent Diabetes Mellitus . GAD-65 is a dominant auto-antigen that is found both in in stiff-man syndrome and insulin-dependent diabetes mellitus. TRAB -positive Graves' disease has been reported to occur together with SMS. 
In a subgroup of patients with the stiff-man syndrome, the condition is likely to have an autoimmune paraneoplastic origin. The detection of autoantibodies against the 128-kd antigen in patients with this syndrome should be considered an indication to search for an occult breast cancer.

HCV may be the etiologic virus of progressive encephalomyelitis with rigidity; a rare disorder similar to stiff-man syndrome although different because it is progressive and fatal.
It is possible that the reported case of association of progressive dementia with concomitant development of stiff-man syndrome in an elderly man represents an exaggerated form of such motor disturbances in dementia, and that clinical and electromyographic features of stiff-man syndrome may be present with increased incidence in patients with dementia."
112,What disease is associated with Anticitrullinated peptide antibodies (ACPAs)?,"['Anticitrullinated protein/peptide antibodies (ACPA) are highly specific for  rheumatoid arthritis (RA). They can be found early in the disease course and are  associated with more severe joint destruction and disease activity. In the last  4 years, important progress has been made in the detection and identification of  ACPA, improving antigenic composition and epitope recognition. Consequently,  many ACPA-ELISA kits have been developed by several manufacturers and are now  commercially available. However, albeit their widespread use in clinical  laboratories, the use of some kits has not been accompanied by a clinical  validation nor by a comparative evaluation of their diagnostic accuracy. In  addition, full automation of ACPA assays featuring ease of use, rapid response,  and high productivity is just beginning to appear on the market and also  deserves clinical and analytical validation. This review will consider the most  relevant characteristics of the ACPA-ELISA assays and will describe the results  of a comparative study performed with all the currently available second- and  third-generation commercial methods.', 'Anti-citrullinated protein/peptide antibodies (ACPAs) are detected in rheumatoid  arthritis (RA) sera and because of their strict association with the disease are  considered marker antibodies, probably endowed with pathogenic potential.  Antibody affinity is one of the parameters affecting pathogenicity. Three  diagnostic citrullinated peptides-viral citrullinated peptide 1 (VCP1) and VCP2  derived from Epstein-Barr virus (EBV)-encoded proteins and histone citrullinated  peptide 1 (HCP1) derived from histone H4-were synthesized as tetrameric multiple  antigen peptides and immobilized on sensor chips CM5 type in a Biacore T100  instrument. Specific binding of purified antibodies from RA patients to the  three peptides was analyzed by surface plasmon resonance using two  arginine-containing sequences as controls. Employing a 1:1 binding model for  affinity constant calculation, ACPAs interacted with VCP1 and VCP2 with lower  apparent affinity (10(-6) M>KD>10(-7) M) and interacted with HCP1 with higher  apparent affinity (KD=10(-8) M). The results indicate that the binding to  citrullinated peptides is characterized by wide differences in affinity, with  slower association and faster dissociation rates in the case of antibodies to  viral citrullinated peptides as compared with antibodies specific for the  histone peptide. This biosensor analysis shows the high cross-reactivity of  purified ACPAs that bind other citrullinated peptides besides the one used for  purification.', 'OBJECTIVE: Citrullinated proteins have been found within atherosclerotic plaque.  However, studies evaluating the association between anti-citrullinated protein  antibodies (ACPAs) and imaging measures of atherosclerosis in patients with  rheumatoid arthritis (RA) have been limited to seroreactive citrullinated  fibrinogen or citrullinated vimentin and have rendered contradictory results.  Therefore, our objective was to evaluate this association using an extended  panel of ACPAs in a larger sample of RA patients without clinical cardiovascular  disease (CVD). METHODS: ACPAs were identified using a custom Bio-Plex bead assay in 270  patients from 2 independent RA cohorts without clinical CVD, with the first one  consisting of 195 patients and the other of 75 patients. Coronary artery calcium  (CAC) was assessed by computed tomography as a measure of coronary artery  disease. RESULTS: High levels of anti-citrullinated histone H2B antibodies were strongly  associated with higher CAC scores, compared with lower antibody levels  (P\u2009=\u20090.001); this remained significant after adjustment for traditional CV and  RA-specific risk factors (P\u2009=\u20090.03). No association between levels of ACPAs and  CAC progression at 3 years was seen (P\u2009=\u20090.09); however, the number of  progressors was small (n\u2009=\u200992). CONCLUSION: Higher levels of ACPAs targeting Cit-histone H2B were associated  with higher CAC scores when compared to lower antibody levels, suggesting a  potential role for histone citrullination seroreactivity in atherosclerosis.', 'INTRODUCTION: Patients with clinically suspect arthralgia (CSA) have, according  to their rheumatologists, an increased risk of rheumatoid arthritis (RA), but  their actual outcome is unexplored. This longitudinal study investigated (1)  progression from CSA to clinically detectable arthritis and (2) associations of  clinical factors, serological factors (among which are anticitrullinated peptide  antibodies (ACPAs)) and MRI-detected subclinical inflammation with arthritis  development. METHODS: 150 patients with CSA were followed for ≥6\u2005months. At baseline,  clinical and serological data were collected and unilateral 1.5\u2005T-MRI of  metacarpophalangeal (MCP), wrist and metatarsophalangeal (MTP) joints was made.  MRI scoring was done according to the RA MRI scoring system. Subclinical MRI  inflammation was defined based on MRI results of 193 symptom-free persons. RESULTS: During follow-up (median=75\u2005weeks, IQR=41-106\u2005weeks), 30 patients  developed clinical arthritis; 87% did so <20\u2005weeks after inclusion. In  multivariable analyses, age, localisation of initial symptoms in small and large  joints (compared with small joints only), C-reactive protein level,  ACPA-positivity and subclinical MRI inflammation significantly associated with  arthritis development; ACPA and MRI inflammation were most strongly associated  (HR (95% CI) respectively, 6.43 (2.57 to 16.05) and 5.07 (1.77 to 14.50)). After  1-year follow-up, 31% of the patients with MRI inflammation and 71% of the  ACPA-positive patients with MRI inflammation had progressed to arthritis.  Forty-three per cent of the patients that developed arthritis within 1 year were  ACPA-negative; 78% of them had subclinical MRI inflammation at baseline. When  MRI inflammation was absent arthritis development was infrequent (6% in all  patients with CSA and 3% in ACPA-negative patients with CSA). CONCLUSIONS: Subclinical MRI inflammation precedes clinical arthritis with a few  months. Subclinical MRI inflammation is, independent of other factors such as  ACPA, associated with arthritis development.', 'OBJECTIVES: To increase understanding of the aetiology and pathogenesis of  rheumatoid arthritis (RA), genetic and environmental risk factors for RA  subsets, defined by the presence or absence of different anticitrullinated  protein/peptide antibodies (ACPAs) targeting citrullinated peptides from  α-enolase, vimentin, fibrinogen and collagen type II, were investigated. METHODS: 1985 patients with RA and 2252 matched controls from the EIRA  case-control cohort were used in the study. Serum samples were assayed by ELISA  for the presence of anticyclic citrullinated peptides (anti-CCP) antibodies and  four different ACPA fine specificities. Cross-reactivity between ACPAs was  examined by peptide absorption experiments. Genotyping was performed for  HLA-DRB1 shared epitope (SE) alleles and the PTPN22 gene, while information  regarding smoking was obtained by questionnaire. The association of genetic and  environmental risk factors with different subsets of RA was calculated by  logistic regression analysis. RESULTS: Limited cross-reactivity was observed between different ACPA fine  specificities. In total, 17 RA subsets could be identified based on their  different ACPA fine specificity profiles. Large differences in association with  genetic and environmental determinants were observed between subsets. The  strongest association of HLA-DRB1 SE, PTPN22 and smoking was identified for the  RA subset which was defined by the presence of antibodies to citrullinated  α-enolase and vimentin. CONCLUSION: This study provides the most comprehensive picture to date of how  HLA-DRB1 SE, PTPN22 and smoking are associated with the presence of specific  ACPA reactivities rather than anti-CCP levels. The new data will form a basis  for molecular studies aimed at understanding disease development in  serologically distinct subsets of RA.', 'BACKGROUND: Anti-citrullinated peptides antibodies (ACPA) are specific for  rheumatoid arthritis and have been implicated in disease pathogenesis. ACPA  examination is a new component of ACR/EULAR 2010 classification criteria for  rheumatoid arthritis. ACPA positivity predicts a more erosive disease course  with severe joint damage and extra-articular manifestations. OBJECTIVES: To evaluate the benefits of ACPA examination in patients with early  undifferentiated arthritis and patients with rheumatoid arthritis. METHODS: We examined patients with arthritis and tested them for ACPA  positivity. In every individual patient we evaluated if ACPA examination was  necessary to establish the diagnosis of rheumatoid arthritis, or to change  treatment, or if the diagnosis could have been established without ACPA  examination (ACR/EULAR 2010 classification criteria was met without ACPA  scoring). RESULTS AND CONCLUSIONS: The study was placed in Slovak Republic. We examined  833 patients with arthritis. There were 43 patients, or 62% of a subgroup of 69  who were ACPA positive whose ACPA examination was not needed-ACR/EULAR criteria  was met without ACPA scoring. This number represents 5.1% of the total number  examined. There were 15 patients, or 22% of the subgroup and 1.8% of the total  whose diagnosis was revised to rheumatoid arthritis due to ACPA  positivity-ACR/EULAR criteria were met solely with ACPA scoring. There were 11  patients (16% and 1.3%) whose medication was changed due to ACPA positivity.  ACPA examination is useful in 3.1% of all examined patients. When we correlate  data on ACPA positive patients, 38% of the patients profit from ACPA  examinations. Considering the relatively low price of ACPA testing, this  examination should not be excluded.', 'BACKGROUND: Anticitrullinated protein antibodies (ACPAs) are serological  biomarkers associated with early, rapidly progressing rheumatoid arthritis (RA),  including more severe disease and joint damage. ACPA testing has become a  routine tool for RA diagnosis and prognosis. Furthermore, treatment efficacy has  been shown to vary by ACPA-positive status. However, it is not clear if the  economic burden of patients with RA varies by ACPA status. OBJECTIVE: To determine if the economic burden of RA varies by patient ACPA  status. METHODS: IMS PharMetrics Plus health insurance claims and electronic medical  record (EMR) data from 2010-2015 were used to identify patients with incident  RA. Patients were aged ≥ 18 years, had ≥ 1 inpatient or ≥ 2 outpatient claims  reporting an RA diagnosis code (ICD-9-CM code 714.0), and had an anticyclic  citrullinated peptide (anti-CCP; a surrogate of ACPA) antibody test within 6  months of diagnosis. Incident patients were defined as those who had no claims  with an RA diagnosis code in the 6 months before the first observed RA  diagnosis. The primary outcome of interest was RA-related medical expenditures,  defined as the sum of payer- and patient-paid amounts for all claims with an RA  diagnosis code. Secondary outcomes included health care utilization metrics such  as treatment with a disease-modifying antirheumatic drug (DMARD) and physician  visits. Generalized linear regression models were used for each outcome,  controlling for ACPA-positive status (defined as anti-CCP ≥ 20 AU/mL), age, sex,  and Charlson Comorbidity Index score as explanatory variables. RESULTS: Of 647,171 patients diagnosed with RA, 89,296 were incident cases, and  47% (n = 42,285) had an anti-CCP test. After restricting this sample to patients  with a linked EMR and reported anti-CCP test result, 859 remained, with 24.7% (n  = 212) being ACPA-positive. Compared with ACPA-negative patients, adjusted  results showed that ACPA-positive patients were more likely to use either  conventional (71.2% vs. 49.6%; P < 0.001) or biologic (20.3% vs. 11.8%; P <  0.001) DMARDs during the first year after diagnosis and had more physician  visits (5.58 vs. 3.91 times per year; P < 0.001). Annual RA-associated total  expenditures were $7,941 for ACPA-positive and $5,243 for ACPA-negative patients  (Δ = $2,698; P = 0.002). RA-associated medical expenditures were $4,380 for  ACPA-positive and $3,427 for ACPA-negative patients (Δ = $954; P = 0.168),  whereas DMARD expenditures were $3,560 and $1,817, respectively (Δ = $1,743; P =  0.001). CONCLUSIONS: RA-related economic burden is higher for patients who are  ACPA-positive compared with those who are ACPA-negative. Providers may wish to  inform patients diagnosed with ACPA-positive RA about the likely future disease  and economic burden in hopes that both stakeholders can be more proactive in  addressing them.

We investigated whether the  combination of these two biomarkers yielded better test characteristics to  predict progression from undifferentiated arthritis (UA) to RA compared with  ACPA alone. METHODS: A total of 394 individuals with UA from a Dutch population-based  inception cohort were included in this study. At baseline, ACPA were measured  and the PTPN22 C1858T and HLA-DRB1 genotypes determined. Progression to RA was  monitored at 1 yr after entry into the cohort. RESULTS: A priori, UA patients had a 35% (95% CI 30-40%) risk of developing RA,  which increased to 66% (95% CI 57-75%) in patients who were ACPA-positive. There  was an additional, although non-significant (P = 0.34), increase in RA risk to  76% (95% CI 57-90%) when patients were positive for both ACPA and the PTPN22  1858T-allele. The area under the receiver operator characteristic curve  increased from 0.68 for ACPA-status alone to 0.70 for the combination of  ACPA-status and the PTPN22 C1858T polymorphism. In logistic regression analysis,  ACPA predicted RA-development independent of PTPN22, while the PTPN22  polymorphism had no independent effect. In HLA-DRB1 shared epitope positive,  ACPA-positive UA patients, ACPA-levels were significantly increased in PTPN22  1858T allele carriers compared with non-1858T carriers. CONCLUSIONS: In this Dutch cohort of UA-patients, the PTPN22 1858T allele does  not markedly improve individual decision-making to predict RA-development over  ACPA alone, but it is associated with higher ACPA-levels.', 'PURPOSE OF REVIEW: To give an overview of publications on presence of  autoantibodies, rheumatoid factor and anticitrullinated protein/peptide  antibodies (ACPAs) and their relationships to genetic markers and soluble  factors as indicators of immune activation and identified predating the onset of  symptoms of rheumatoid arthritis (RA). RECENT FINDINGS: The development during recent years concerning autoantibodies  with high specificity for RA, ACPAs, has confirmed previous findings of presence  of autoantibodies, such as rheumatoid factors and antikeratin antibodies, years  before disease onset. Particularly, ACPAs in combination with human leukocyte  antigen-shared epitope alleles and PTPN22 1858T carriage increased the relative  risks of developing RA compared with not having these factors. Both shared  epitope alleles and 1858T variant seemed to contribute to development of ACPAs  rather than independently contribute to RA. Soluble factors such as  hypersensitive C-reactive protein, cytokines, cytokine receptors and chemokines  are upregulated before disease onset, though, not as long antedating time as  ACPAs and rheumatoid factors. SUMMARY: Presence of ACPAs and rheumatoid factors are present several years  before disease onset suggesting a gradual process leading to the development of  RA. Genetic markers such as shared epitope alleles and PTPN22 1858T variant  increase the relative risk for disease development. Soluble immunological  markers are also increased closer to the onset of symptoms indicating activation  of the immune system.']","nticitrullinated protein antibodies (ACPAs) are serological biomarkers associated with early, rapidly progressing rheumatoid arthritis (RA)"
113,Which disease can be prevented with PfSPZ Vaccine?,"['PfSPZ Vaccine, composed of radiation-attenuated, aseptic, purified,  cryopreserved Plasmodium falciparum sporozoites, is administered by direct  venous inoculation (DVI) for maximal efficacy against malaria. A critical issue  for advancing vaccines that are administered intravenously is the ability to  efficiently administer them across multiple age groups. As part of a pediatric  safety, immunogenicity, and efficacy trial in western Kenya, we evaluated the  feasibility and tolerability of DVI, including ease of venous access, injection  time, and crying during the procedure across age groups. Part 1 was an age  de-escalation, dose escalation trial in children aged 13\xa0months-5\xa0years and  infants aged 5-12\xa0months; part 2 was a vaccine efficacy trial including only  infants, using the most skilled injectors from part 1. Injectors could use a  vein viewer, if needed. A total of 1222 injections (target 0.5\xa0mL) were  initiated by DVI in 511 participants (36 were 5-9-year-olds, 65 were  13-59-month-olds, and 410 infants). The complete volume was injected in  1185/1222 (97.0%) vaccinations, 1083/1185 (91.4%) achieved with the first DVI.  474/511 (92.8%) participants received only complete injections, 27/511 (5.3%)  received at least one partial injection (<0.5\xa0mL), and in 10/511 (2.0%) venous  access was not obtained. The rate of complete injections by single DVI for  infants improved from 77.1% in part 1 to 92.8% in part 2. No crying occurred in  51/59 (86.4%) vaccinations in 5-9-year-olds, 25/86 (29.1%) vaccinations in  13-59-month-olds and 172/1067 (16.1%) vaccinations in infants. Mean  administration time ranged from 2.6 to 4.6\xa0minutes and was longer for younger  age groups. These data show that vaccination by DVI was feasible and well  tolerated in infants and children in this rural hospital in western Kenya, when  performed by skilled injectors. We also report that shipping and storage in  liquid nitrogen vapor phase was simple and efficient. (Clinicaltrials.gov  NCT02687373).', 'BACKGROUND: A live-attenuated Plasmodium falciparum sporozoite (SPZ) vaccine  (PfSPZ Vaccine) has shown up to 100% protection against controlled human malaria  infection (CHMI) using homologous parasites (same P. falciparum strain as in the  vaccine). Using a more stringent CHMI, with heterologous parasites (different P.  falciparum strain), we assessed the impact of higher PfSPZ doses, a novel  multi-dose prime regimen, and a delayed vaccine boost upon vaccine efficacy  (VE). METHODS: We immunized 4 groups that each contained 15 healthy, malaria-naive  adults. Group 1 received 5 doses of 4.5 x 105 PfSPZ (Days 1, 3, 5, and 7; Week  16). Groups 2, 3, and 4 received 3 doses (Weeks 0, 8, and 16), with Group 2  receiving 9.0 × 105/doses; Group 3 receiving 18.0 × 105/doses; and Group 4  receiving 27.0 × 105 for dose 1 and 9.0 × 105 for doses 2 and 3. VE was assessed  by heterologous CHMI after 12 or 24 weeks. Volunteers not protected at 12 weeks  were boosted prior to repeat CHMI at 24 weeks. RESULTS: At 12-week CHMI, 6/15 (40%) participants in Group 1 (P = .04) and 3/15  (20%) participants in Group 2 remained aparasitemic, as compared to 0/8  controls. At 24-week CHMI, 3/13 (23%) participants in Group 3 and 3/14 (21%)  participants in Group 4 remained aparasitemic, versus 0/8 controls (Groups 2-4,  VE not significant). Postboost, 9/14 (64%) participants versus 0/8 controls  remained aparasitemic (3/6 in Group 1, P = .025; 6/8 in Group 2, P = .002). CONCLUSIONS: Administering 4 stacked priming injections (multi-dose priming)  resulted in 40% VE against heterologous CHMI, while dose escalation of PfSPZ  using single-dose priming was not significantly protective. Boosting unprotected  subjects improved VE at 24 weeks, to 64%. CLINICAL TRIALS REGISTRATION: NCT02601716.', 'Immunization with attenuated Plasmodium falciparum sporozoites (PfSPZs) has been  shown to be protective against malaria, but the features of the antibody  response induced by this treatment remain unclear. To investigate this response  in detail, we isolated IgM and IgG monoclonal antibodies from Tanzanian  volunteers who were immunized with repeated injection of Sanaria PfSPZ Vaccine  and who were found to be protected from controlled human malaria infection with  infectious homologous PfSPZs. All isolated IgG monoclonal antibodies bound to P.  falciparum circumsporozoite protein (PfCSP) and recognized distinct epitopes in  its N terminus, NANP-repeat region, and C terminus. Strikingly, the most  effective antibodies, as determined in a humanized mouse model, bound not only  to the repeat region, but also to a minimal peptide at the PfCSP N-terminal  junction that is not in the RTS,S vaccine. These dual-specific antibodies were  isolated from different donors and were encoded by VH3-30 or VH3-33 alleles that  encode tryptophan or arginine at position 52. Using structural and mutational  data, we describe the elements required for germline recognition and affinity  maturation. Our study provides potent neutralizing antibodies and relevant  information for lineage-targeted vaccine design and immunization strategies.', 'We are using controlled human malaria infection (CHMI) by direct venous  inoculation (DVI) of cryopreserved, infectious Plasmodium falciparum (Pf)  sporozoites (SPZ) (PfSPZ Challenge) to try to reduce time and costs of  developing PfSPZ Vaccine to prevent malaria in Africa. Immunization with five  doses at 0, 4, 8, 12, and 20 weeks of 2.7 × 105 PfSPZ of PfSPZ Vaccine gave 65%  vaccine efficacy (VE) at 24 weeks against mosquito bite CHMI in U.S. adults and  52% (time to event) or 29% (proportional) VE over 24 weeks against naturally  transmitted Pf in Malian adults. We assessed the identical regimen in Tanzanians  for VE against PfSPZ Challenge. Twenty- to thirty-year-old men were randomized  to receive five doses normal saline or PfSPZ Vaccine in a double-blind trial.  Vaccine efficacy was assessed 3 and 24 weeks later. Adverse events were similar  in vaccinees and controls. Antibody responses to Pf circumsporozoite protein  were significantly lower than in malaria-naïve Americans, but significantly  higher than in Malians. All 18 controls developed Pf parasitemia after CHMI.  Four of 20 (20%) vaccinees remained uninfected after 3 week CHMI (P = 0.015 by  time to event, P = 0.543 by proportional analysis) and all four (100%) were  uninfected after repeat 24 week CHMI (P = 0.005 by proportional, P = 0.004 by  time to event analysis). Plasmodium falciparum SPZ Vaccine was safe, well  tolerated, and induced durable VE in four subjects. Controlled human malaria  infection by DVI of PfSPZ Challenge appeared more stringent over 24 weeks than  mosquito bite CHMI in United States or natural exposure in Malian adults,  thereby providing a rigorous test of VE in Africa.', ""A highly protective malaria vaccine would greatly facilitate the prevention and  elimination of malaria and containment of drug-resistant parasites. A high level  (more than 90%) of protection against malaria in humans has previously been  achieved only by immunization with radiation-attenuated Plasmodium falciparum  (Pf) sporozoites (PfSPZ) inoculated by mosquitoes; by intravenous injection of  aseptic, purified, radiation-attenuated, cryopreserved PfSPZ ('PfSPZ Vaccine');  or by infectious PfSPZ inoculated by mosquitoes to volunteers taking chloroquine  or mefloquine (chemoprophylaxis with sporozoites). We assessed immunization by  direct venous inoculation of aseptic, purified, cryopreserved, non-irradiated  PfSPZ ('PfSPZ Challenge') to malaria-naive, healthy adult volunteers taking  chloroquine for antimalarial chemoprophylaxis (vaccine approach denoted as  PfSPZ-CVac). Three doses of 5.12\u2009×\u2009104 PfSPZ of PfSPZ Challenge at 28-day  intervals were well tolerated and safe, and prevented infection in 9 out of 9  (100%) volunteers who underwent controlled human malaria infection ten weeks  after the last dose (group III). Protective efficacy was dependent on dose and  regimen. Immunization with 3.2\u2009×\u2009103 (group I) or 1.28\u2009×\u2009104 (group II) PfSPZ  protected 3 out of 9 (33%) or 6 out of 9 (67%) volunteers, respectively. Three  doses of 5.12\u2009×\u2009104 PfSPZ at five-day intervals protected 5 out of 8 (63%)  volunteers. The frequency of Pf-specific polyfunctional CD4 memory T cells was  associated with protection. On a 7,455 peptide Pf proteome array, immune sera  from at least 5 out of 9 group III vaccinees recognized each of 22 proteins.  PfSPZ-CVac is a highly efficacious vaccine candidate; when we are able to  optimize the immunization regimen (dose, interval between doses, and drug  partner), this vaccine could be used for combination mass drug administration  and a mass vaccination program approach to eliminate malaria from geographically  defined areas."", 'Great progress has been made in the development of whole sporozoite vaccines  including the manufacturing of cryopreserved Plasmodium falciparum sporozoites  (PfSPZ) suitable for clinical application. Such whole sporozoites are being used  for clinical studies of controlled human malaria infection (CHMI) as well as for  evaluation of candidate vaccine approaches (both attenuated sporozoites and  infectious sporozoites administered with chemoprophylaxis) and as reagents for  immunology and cell biology assays. CHMI studies with whole sporozoites provide  a great opportunity to better understand the intrinsic mechanisms of resistance  to P. falciparum (e.g. due to sickle cell trait and other hemoglobinopathies) as  well as host responses to an initial P. falciparum infection. High-level  protective efficacy has been demonstrated in a small number of volunteers after  intravenous (IV) inoculation of radiation-attenuated PfSPZ or in those who were  exposed to live PfSPZ while on malaria chemoprophylaxis. These advances and data  warrant further investigations of the immunological mechanism(s) whereby whole  sporozoite inoculation elicits protective immunity in order to facilitate whole  sporozoite vaccine development. The National Institute of Allergy and Infectious  Diseases (NIAID) convened a workshop on Sept. 2-3, 2014 involving participation  of international experts in the field of malaria vaccine development, and in  basic and clinical immunology research. The workshop discussed the current  understanding of host immune responses to whole malaria sporozoite inoculation,  identified gaps in knowledge, resources to facilitate progress, and applicable  new technologies and approaches to accelerate immunologic and vaccinologic  studies and biomarker identification. This report summarizes the discussions and  major conclusions from the workshop participants.', 'Plasmodium falciparum sporozoite (PfSPZ) Vaccine (radiation-attenuated, aseptic,  purified, cryopreserved PfSPZ) and PfSPZ-CVac (infectious, aseptic, purified,  cryopreserved PfSPZ administered to subjects taking weekly chloroquine  chemoprophylaxis) have shown vaccine efficacies (VEs) of 100% against homologous  controlled human malaria infection (CHMI) in nonimmune adults. Plasmodium  falciparum sporozoite-CVac has never been assessed against CHMI in African  vaccinees. We assessed the safety, immunogenicity, and VE against homologous  CHMI of three doses of 2.7 × 106 PfSPZ of PfSPZ Vaccine at 8-week intervals and  three doses of 1.0 × 105 PfSPZ of PfSPZ-CVac at 4-week intervals with each arm  randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, and conducted in parallel. There  were no differences in solicited adverse events between vaccinees and normal  saline controls, or between PfSPZ Vaccine and PfSPZ-CVac recipients during the 6  days after administration of investigational product. However, from days 7-13,  PfSPZ-CVac recipients had significantly more AEs, probably because of Pf  parasitemia. Antibody responses were 2.9 times higher in PfSPZ Vaccine  recipients than PfSPZ-CVac recipients at time of CHMI. Vaccine efficacy at a  median of 14 weeks after last PfSPZ-CVac dose was 55% (8 of 13, P = 0.051) and  at a median of 15 weeks after last PfSPZ Vaccine dose was 27% (5 of 15, P =  0.32). The higher VE in PfSPZ-CVac recipients of 55% with a 27-fold lower dose  was likely a result of later stage parasite maturation in the liver, leading to  induction of cellular immunity against a greater quantity and broader array of  antigens.', 'BACKGROUND: Whole parasite vaccines provide a unique opportunity for dissecting  immune mechanisms and identify antigens that are targeted by immune responses  which have the potential to mediate sterile protection against malaria  infections. The radiation attenuated sporozoite (PfSPZ) vaccine has been  considered the gold standard for malaria vaccines because of its unparalleled  efficacy. The immunogenicity of this and other vaccines continues to be  evaluated by using recombinant proteins or peptides of known sporozoite  antigens. This approach, however, has significant limitations by relying solely  on a limited number of known pathogen-associated immune epitopes. Using the full  range of antigens expressed by the sporozoite will enable the comprehensive  immune-profiling of humoral immune responses induced by whole parasite vaccines.  To address this challenge, a novel ELISA based on sporozoites\xa0was developed. RESULTS: The SPZ-ELISA method described in this report can be performed with  either freshly dissected sporozoites or with cryopreserved sporozoite lysates.  The use of a fixative for reproducible coating is not required. The SPZ-ELISA  was first validated using monoclonal antibodies specific for CSP and TRAP and  then used for the characterization of immune sera from radiation attenuated  sporozoite vaccinees. CONCLUSION: Applying this simple and highly reproducible approach to assess  immune responses induced by malaria vaccines, both recombinant and whole  parasite vaccines, (1) will help in the evaluation of immune responses induced  by antigenically complex malaria vaccines such as the irradiated SPZ-vaccine,  (2) will facilitate and accelerate the identification of immune correlates of  protection, and (3) can also be a valuable assessment tool for antigen discovery  as well as down-selection of vaccine formulations and, thereby, guide vaccine  design.', 'A new vaccine called Zostavax is available to reduce the risk of shingles  (herpes zoster) in people ages 60 and older.', 'Postherpetic neuralgia (PHN) is a challenging condition for pain management  specialists.

This RZV has shown  promising results in many clinical trials, with high reactogenicity and similar  systemic adverse effects compared to those of LZV. The National Advisory  Committee on Immunization has recommended LZV as a standard vaccine for HZ  prevention in adults ≥ 50 years of age, but no studies directly comparing the  safety and efficacy of RZV and LZV vaccines have been conducted.

A short-term administration  of 75 microg of T3 daily for 7 days suppressed serum TSH concentrations almost  completely in normal subjects, but suppressed TSH only partially in patients  with resistance to thyroid hormone and TSH-secreting pituitary adenoma. A  single-dose administration of 75 microg of T3 gave similar results in regard to  TSH suppressibility in these three subjects groups. In contrast, a single-dose  administration of 1.4 mg of Triac remarkably suppressed serum TSH concentrations  after 2 hours in not only normal subjects (-34 +/- 11% [mean +/- SD] from the  basal value) but also in patients with resistance to thyroid hormone (-31 +/-  9%), and this TSH suppression continued for 4 hours. After 24 hours, this TSH  suppression persisted in normal subjects (-62 +/- 12%) but was relieved in  patients with resistance to thyroid hormone (-23 +/- 14%). After the Triac  administration, molar ratios of alpha-subunit to TSH in serum were decreased in  patients with TSH-secreting pituitary adenoma but increased in patients with  resistance to thyroid hormone. Because the Triac therapy for patients with  resistance to thyroid hormone suppressed pituitary-TSH secretion during the  early phase of drug ingestion, this drug should be given several times within a  day to obtain continuous TSH-suppressive effects."", ""BACKGROUND: Tetraiodothyroacetic acid (tetrac) is a deaminated analogue of  L-thyroxine that blocks the actions of L-thyroxine and  3,5,3'-triiodo-L-thyronine at the cell surface receptor for thyroid hormone on  integrin alpha v beta 3. Tetrac blocks the proliferative effects of thyroid  hormone on tumor cells and the proangiogenesis actions of the hormone. In the  absence of thyroid hormone, tetrac also blocks angiogenesis induced by various  growth factors. Covalently linked to poly(lactide-co-glycolide), tetrac  nanoparticles (tetrac NP) do not gain access to the cell interior and act  exclusively at the integrin receptor. Here, the activity of tetrac and tetrac NP  against follicular thyroid carcinoma (FTC)-236 cells was studied in two models:  (1) tumor cell implants in the chick chorioallantoic membrane (CAM) system and  (2) xenografts in the nude mouse. METHODS: FTC-236 cells (10(6)) were implanted in the CAM (n = 8 each for  control, and for tetrac and tetrac NP, both at 1 microg/CAM) and the actions of  tetrac and tetrac NP were determined after 8 days on tumor-related angiogenesis  and tumor growth. Xenografts of 10(7) FTC-236 cells were implanted in nude mice  (n = 8 per group). Tetrac or tetrac NP was administered intraperitoneal (1 mg/kg  and 1 mg tetrac equivalent/kg, respectively) every other day for 32 days  beginning on day 10, when tumor volume was 200-250 mm(3). Animals were monitored  after discontinuation of treatment up to day 40. RESULTS: In the CAM paradigm, tetrac and tetrac NP arrested tumor-related  angiogenesis and tumor growth. In the xenograft model, tetrac and tetrac NP  promptly and progressively reduced tumor volume (p < 0.01) over 32 days. There  was some regrowth of tumor after interruption of tetrac treatment, but at day  40, tumor volume and tumor weight at sacrifice were 45-55% below those of  controls (p < 0.01). Animal weight gain was comparable in the control and  treatment groups of animals. CONCLUSIONS: Tetrac and tetrac NP effectively arrest FTC-236 cell tumor growth  in the CAM and xenograft models, suggesting its potential utility against FTC."", 'Thyroid hormone has been recently shown to induce tumor growth and angiogenesis  via a plasma-membrane hormone receptor on integrin alphaVbeta3. The receptor is  at or near the Arg-Gly-Asp (RGD) recognition site on the integrin that is  important to extracellular matrix (ECM) protein and vascular growth factor  interactions with the integrin. In the present study, we examined the  possibility that tetraiodothyroacetic acid (tetrac), a deaminated, non-agonist  thyroid hormone analog that binds to the integrin receptor, may modulate  vascular growth factor-induced angiogenesis in the absence of thyroid hormone.  Angiogenesis models were studied in which VEGF or FGF2 (1-2 microg/ml) induced  tube formation in human dermal microvascular endothelial cells (HDMEC),  stimulated new blood vessel branch formation in the chick chorioallantoic  membrane (CAM) and induced angiogenesis in the mouse matrigel model. In all  models, tetrac (1-10 microM) and at 10 microg in mouse matrigel inhibited the  pro-angiogenesis activity of VEGF and FGF2 by more than 50%. RT-PCR revealed  that tetrac (1-3 microM) decreased abundance of angiopoietin-2 mRNA, but not  angiopoietin-1 mRNA, in VEGF-exposed endothelial cells, suggesting that specific  angiogenic pathways are targeted by tetrac. Tetrac is a novel, inexpensive small  molecule whose anti-angiogenic activity in the present studies is proposed to  reflect inhibition, via the integrin RGD recognition/thyroid hormone receptor  site, of crosstalk between plasma-membrane vascular growth factor receptors and  integrin alphaVbeta3.', 'Thyroid hormones [predominantly 3, 5, 3 -I- iodothyronine (T3)] regulate  cholesterol and lipoprotein metabolism but cardiac effects restrict their use as  hypolipidemic drugs. New molecules have been developped which target  specifically the thyroid hormone receptor ss, predominant isoform in liver. The  first thyroid hormone agonist, called GC1, has selective actions compared to T3.  In animals, GC1 reduced serum cholesterol and serum triglycerides, probably by  stimulation important steps in reverse cholesterol transport. Other selective  thyromimetic, KB- 2115 and KB - 141 have similar effects. Another class of  thyroid hormone analogs, the thyronamines have emerged recently but the basic  biology of this new class of endogenous thyroid hormone remains to better  understood. Therefore, these molecules may be a potentially treatment for  obesity and reduction cholesterol, triglycerides and lipoprotein (a). To date  the studies in human are preliminary. Tolerance and efficacy of these drugs are  still under investigation.', 'Thyroid hormone (TH) has long been recognized as a major modulator of metabolic  efficiency, energy expenditure, and thermogenesis. TH effects in regulating  metabolic efficiency are transduced by controlling the coupling of mitochondrial  oxidative phosphorylation and the cycling of extramitochondrial substrate/futile  cycles. However, despite our present understanding of the genomic and nongenomic  modes of action of TH, its control of mitochondrial coupling still remains  elusive. This review summarizes historical and up-to-date findings concerned  with TH regulation of metabolic energetics, while integrating its genomic and  mitochondrial activities. It underscores the role played by TH-induced gating of  the mitochondrial permeability transition pore (PTP) in controlling metabolic  efficiency. PTP gating may offer a unified target for some TH pleiotropic  activities and may serve as a novel target for synthetic functional  thyromimetics designed to modulate metabolic efficiency. PTP gating by  long-chain fatty acid analogs may serve as a model for such strategy.', 'The concept of thyroid hormone (TH) analogs that retain the beneficial effects  of TH excess on lipid lowering and fat metabolism, while avoiding any harmful  effects on the heart, muscle, bone and other tissues, has interested scientists  and physicians for several decades. While there have been many attempts to  develop selective TH receptor (TR) modulators (STRMs) for safe lipid lowering,  these approaches have failed consistently. This review details recent advances  in the development of TRβ subtype- and liver-selective STRM analogs, and  presents the results of preliminary clinical trials with one of these compounds,  eprotirome (KB-2115; Karo Bio AB).', 'Studies in hypothyroid rats show that, when infused with a combination of  thyroxine (T4) plus triiodothyronine (T3) to normalize thyrotropin (TSH),  euthyroidism in all organs is only ensured when T(4) and T(3) are administered  in a ratio as normally secreted by the rat thyroid. As substitution with  T(4)-only results in an abnormal serum T(4)/T(3) ratio, it is also possible that  in humans, euthyroidism does not exist at the tissue level in many organs,  considering that iodothyronine metabolism in the human and the rat share many  similar mechanisms. Recent reports in which cognitive function and well-being  are compared in patients with primary hypothyroidism substituted with T(4)-only  versus substitution with T(4) plus T(3) result in controversial findings in that  either positive or no effects were found. In all these studies T(3) was used in  the plain form that results in nonphysiologic serum T(3) peaks. In these studies  it is suggested that substitution with T(3 )should preferably be performed with  a preparation that slowly releases T(3) to avoid these peaks. In the study  reported here we show that treatment of hypothyroid subjects with a combination  of T(4) plus slow-release T(3) leads to a considerable improvement of serum T(4)  and T(3) values, the T(4)/T(3) ratio and serum TSH as compared to treatment with  T(4)- only. Serum T(3) administration with slow-release T(3) did not show serum  peaks, in contrast to plain T(3).', 'To define the minimal structural requirements for cardiac activity of thyroid  hormone analogs, a series of substituted phenols were screened for their ability  to bind bacterially expressed thyroid hormone receptors. Compounds with binding  activity then were tested for their ability to induce expression of alpha-myosin  heavy chain mRNA in primary cultures of fetal rat cardiomyocytes, a sensitive  marker for potential inotropic activity. 3,5-Diiodo-4-hydroxyphenylpropionic  acid (DIHPA) was found to bind specifically to bacterially expressed alpha-1 and  beta-1 thyroid hormone receptors (Kaff approximately 1 to 2 x 10(5) M-1) and to  induce alpha-myosin heavy chain (EC50 approximately 5 x 10(-7)). To assess the  effects of DIHPA on cardiac performance in vivo, hemodynamic measurements were  made in three groups of hypothyroid rats treated for 5 days with s.c. doses of  DIHPA (15 mg/100 g), L-thyroxine (T4, 1.5 micrograms/100 g) or saline. Compared  to controls, DIHPA and T4 produced increases in heart rate, left ventricular  +dP/dtmax, -dP/dtmax, and isovolumic relaxation. In isometric papillary muscles  preparations, DIHPA and T4 shortened time-to-peak tension and time-from-peak  tension to 50% decline as compared with saline-treated controls. Muscles from  both drug-treatment groups showed similar responses to graded doses of  isoproterenol (10(-8) to 10(-3) M) and to variations in Ca++ concentration of  the muscle bath (0.3125 to 3.75 x 10(-3) M). Thus, DIHPA is a novel thyromimetic  compound with effects on myocardial function similar to those observed with T4.', ""INTRODUCTION: The potential therapeutic applications of thyrotropin-releasing  hormone (TRH) have attracted attention, based on its broad-spectrum  neuropharmacological action rather than its endocrine properties. These central  nervous system (CNS)-mediated effects provide the rationale for use of TRH and  its analogs in the treatment of brain and spinal injury, and CNS disorders like  schizophrenia, Alzheimer's disease, epilepsy, amyotrophic lateral sclerosis,  Parkinson's disease, depression, shock and ischemia. AREAS COVERED: This review summarizes the patent literature and advances in the  discovery and development of novel TRH analogs over the past 20 years. It  provides a comprehensive overview of the development of new TRH analogs, giving  emphasis to their pharmaceutical profile. EXPERT OPINION: The use of TRH in the treatment of various CNS disorders has  been proven clinically. However, TRH itself is a poor drug candidate due to its  short plasma half-life (5 min), poor biopharmaceutical properties (low  intestinal and CNS permeability) and endocrine side effect. Nevertheless,  researchers have come up with metabolically stable, more potent and selective  TRH analogs and prodrugs. Taltirelin, one of the TRH analogs, has been approved  under the trade name of Ceredist(®) in Japan for the treatment of  spinocerebellar degeneration. Several other TRH analogs are in various stages of  preclinical or clinical development."", ""The effects on ventricular myosin isoenzyme expression of naturally occurring  and synthetic thyroid analogs (3,5,3'-L-triiodothyronine,  3,5,3'-D-triiodothyronine, 3,3',5'-L- triiodothyronine ,  3,5,3'-L-triiodothyroacetic acid and 3,5-L-diiodothyronine), catecholamines and  high carbohydrate diets have been studied in thyroidectomized and  hypophysectomized rats. Also, the effects on myosin isoenzyme expression of  adrenalectomy and hydrocortisone replacement have been studied in euthyroid  animals. Myocardial CO2 production and hepatic alpha-glycerolphosphate  dehydrogenase activity were measured to monitor the effects of these  interventions on tissue respiration. The results indicate that there was no  significant separation between the actions of thyroid analogs on metabolic  parameters and myosin isoenzyme patterns. However, high carbohydrate feeding in  hypophysectomized rats increased the isoenzyme V1 from 12% to about 36% of total  myosin; partial replacement with 3,5,3'-L-triiodothyronine and fructose feeding  had synergistic actions. In thyroidectomized rats, feeding a high carbohydrate  diet increased the V1 form from undetectable levels to about 28% of total  myosin; partial 3,5,3'-L-triiodothyronine replacement had an additive effect.  Beta adrenergic stimulation with isoproterenol and blockade with propranolol did  not affect myosin isoenzyme expression. Adrenalectomy in euthyroid rats caused a  33% decrease in the V1 form and a corresponding increase in the V3 isoenzyme,  which could be reversed by treatment with hydrocortisone. Thus, thyroid analogs  do not selectively stimulate myosin isoenzyme expression as compared with their  effects on energy production. Furthermore, the results suggest that the  mechanism for regulation of cardiac myosin isoenzymes may involve a primary  signal related to dietary carbohydrate, which is modulated by thyroid hormone,  and possibly glucocorticoids.""]",TRIAC and TETRAC are two different thyroid hormone analogs utilized in human studies
115,Which enzyme is inhibited by a drug Lorlatinib?,"['BACKGROUND: Lorlatinib is a potent, brain-penetrant, third-generation inhibitor  of ALK and ROS1 tyrosine kinases with broad coverage of ALK mutations. In a  phase 1 study, activity was seen in patients with ALK-positive non-small-cell  lung cancer, most of whom had CNS metastases and progression after ALK-directed  therapy. We aimed to analyse the overall and intracranial antitumour activity of  lorlatinib in patients with ALK-positive, advanced non-small-cell lung cancer. METHODS: In this phase 2 study, patients with histologically or cytologically  ALK-positive or ROS1-positive, advanced, non-small-cell lung cancer, with or  without CNS metastases, with an Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group performance  status of 0, 1, or 2, and adequate end-organ function were eligible. Patients  were enrolled into six different expansion cohorts (EXP1-6) on the basis of ALK  and ROS1 status and previous therapy, and were given lorlatinib 100 mg orally  once daily continuously in 21-day cycles. The primary endpoint was overall and  intracranial tumour response by independent central review, assessed in pooled  subgroups of ALK-positive patients. Analyses of activity and safety were based  on the safety analysis set (ie, all patients who received at least one dose of  lorlatinib) as assessed by independent central review. Patients with measurable  CNS metastases at baseline by independent central review were included in the  intracranial activity analyses. In this report, we present lorlatinib activity  data for the ALK-positive patients (EXP1-5 only), and safety data for all  treated patients (EXP1-6). This study is ongoing and is registered with  ClinicalTrials.gov, number NCT01970865. FINDINGS: Between Sept 15, 2015, and Oct 3, 2016, 276 patients were enrolled: 30  who were ALK positive and treatment naive (EXP1); 59 who were ALK positive and  received previous crizotinib without (n=27; EXP2) or with (n=32; EXP3A) previous  chemotherapy; 28 who were ALK positive and received one previous non-crizotinib  ALK tyrosine kinase inhibitor, with or without chemotherapy (EXP3B); 112 who  were ALK positive with two (n=66; EXP4) or three (n=46; EXP5) previous ALK  tyrosine kinase inhibitors with or without chemotherapy; and 47 who were ROS1  positive with any previous treatment (EXP6). One patient in EXP4 died before  receiving lorlatinib and was excluded from the safety analysis set. In  treatment-naive patients (EXP1), an objective response was achieved in 27  (90·0%; 95% CI 73·5-97·9) of 30 patients. Three patients in EXP1 had measurable  baseline CNS lesions per independent central review, and objective intracranial  responses were observed in two (66·7%; 95% CI 9·4-99·2). In ALK-positive  patients with at least one previous ALK tyrosine kinase inhibitor (EXP2-5),  objective responses were achieved in 93 (47·0%; 39·9-54·2) of 198 patients and  objective intracranial response in those with measurable baseline CNS lesions in  51 (63·0%; 51·5-73·4) of 81 patients. Objective response was achieved in 41  (69·5%; 95% CI 56·1-80·8) of 59 patients who had only received previous  crizotinib (EXP2-3A), nine (32·1%; 15·9-52·4) of 28 patients with one previous  non-crizotinib ALK tyrosine kinase inhibitor (EXP3B), and 43 (38·7%; 29·6-48·5)  of 111 patients with two or more previous ALK tyrosine kinase inhibitors  (EXP4-5). Objective intracranial response was achieved in 20 (87·0%; 95% CI  66·4-97·2) of 23 patients with measurable baseline CNS lesions in EXP2-3A, five  (55·6%; 21·2-86·3) of nine patients in EXP3B, and 26 (53·1%; 38·3-67·5) of 49  patients in EXP4-5. The most common treatment-related adverse events across all  patients were hypercholesterolaemia (224 [81%] of 275 patients overall and 43  [16%] grade 3-4) and hypertriglyceridaemia (166 [60%] overall and 43 [16%] grade  3-4). Serious treatment-related adverse events occurred in 19 (7%) of 275  patients and seven patients (3%) permanently discontinued treatment because of  treatment-related adverse events. No treatment-related deaths were reported. INTERPRETATION: Consistent with its broad ALK mutational coverage and CNS  penetration, lorlatinib showed substantial overall and intracranial activity  both in treatment-naive patients with ALK-positive non-small-cell lung cancer,  and in those who had progressed on crizotinib, second-generation ALK tyrosine  kinase inhibitors, or after up to three previous ALK tyrosine kinase inhibitors.  Thus, lorlatinib could represent an effective treatment option for patients with  ALK-positive non-small-cell lung cancer in first-line or subsequent therapy. FUNDING: Pfizer.', 'Lorlatinib (PF-06463922) is a promising oral anaplastic lymphoma kinase (ALK)  and ROS1 inhibitor currently in Phase III clinical trials for treatment of  non-small-cell lung cancer (NSCLC) containing an ALK rearrangement. With  therapy-resistant brain metastases a major concern in NSCLC, lorlatinib was  designed to have high membrane and blood-brain barrier permeability. We  investigated the roles of the multidrug efflux transporters ABCB1 and ABCG2, and  the multispecific drug-metabolizing enzyme CYP3A in plasma pharmacokinetics and  tissue distribution of lorlatinib using genetically modified mouse strains. In  vitro, human ABCB1 and mouse Abcg2 modestly transported lorlatinib. Following  oral lorlatinib administration (at 10 mg/kg), brain accumulation of lorlatinib,  while relatively high in wild-type mice, was still fourfold increased in  Abcb1a/1b-/- and Abcb1a/1b;Abcg2-/- mice, but not in single Abcg2-/- mice.  Lorlatinib plasma levels were not altered. Oral coadministration of the  ABCB1/ABCG2 inhibitor elacridar increased the brain accumulation of lorlatinib  in wild-type mice fourfold, that is, to the same level as in Abcb1a/1b;Abcg2-/-  mice, without altering plasma exposure. Similar results were obtained for  lorlatinib testis accumulation. In Cyp3a-/- mice, the plasma exposure of  lorlatinib was increased 1.3-fold, but was then twofold reduced upon transgenic  overexpression of human CYP3A4 in liver and intestine, whereas relative tissue  distribution of lorlatinib remained unaltered. Our data indicate that lorlatinib  brain accumulation is substantially limited by P-glycoprotein/ABCB1 in the  blood-brain barrier, but this can be effectively reversed by elacridar  coadministration. Moreover, oral availability of lorlatinib is markedly  restricted by CYP3A4 activity. These insights may be used in optimizing the  therapeutic application of lorlatinib.', 'The Massachusetts General Hospital Radiochemistry Program, in collaboration with  Pfizer, has developed unique 11C and 18F-labeling strategies to synthesize  isotopologs of lorlatinib (PF-06463922) which is undergoing phase III clinical  trial investigations for treatment of non-small-cell lung cancers with specific  molecular alterations. A major goal in cancer therapeutics is to measure the  concentrations of this drug in the brain metastases of patients with lung  cancer, and penetration of the blood-brain barrier is important for optimal  therapeutic outcomes. Our recent publication in Nature Communications employed  radiolabeled lorlatinib and positron emission tomography (PET) studies in  preclinical models including nonhuman primates (NHPs) that demonstrated high  brain permeability of this compound. Our future work with radiolabeled  lorlatinib will include advanced PET evaluations in rodent tumor models and  normal NHPs with the goal of clinical translation.', 'Purpose Advanced anaplastic lymphoma kinase ( ALK) fusion-positive  non-small-cell lung cancers (NSCLCs) are effectively treated with ALK tyrosine  kinase inhibitors (TKIs). However, clinical outcomes in these patients vary, and  the benefit of TKIs is limited as a result of acquired resistance. Emerging data  suggest that the ALK fusion variant may affect clinical outcome, but the  molecular basis for this association is unknown. Patients and Methods We  identified 129 patients with ALK-positive NSCLC with known ALK variants. ALK  resistance mutations and clinical outcomes on ALK TKIs were retrospectively  evaluated according to ALK variant. A Foundation Medicine data set of 577  patients with ALK-positive NSCLC was also examined. Results The most frequent  ALK variants were EML4-ALK variant 1 in 55 patients (43%) and variant 3 in 51  patients (40%). We analyzed 77 tumor biopsy specimens from patients with  variants 1 and 3 who had progressed on an ALK TKI. ALK resistance mutations were  significantly more common in variant 3 than in variant 1 (57% v 30%; P = .023).  In particular, ALK G1202R was more common in variant 3 than in variant 1 (32% v  0%; P < .001). Analysis of the Foundation Medicine database revealed similar  associations of variant 3 with ALK resistance mutation and with G1202R ( P =  .010 and .015, respectively). Among patients treated with the third-generation  ALK TKI lorlatinib, variant 3 was associated with a significantly longer  progression-free survival than variant 1 (hazard ratio, 0.31; 95% CI, 0.12 to  0.79; P = .011). Conclusion Specific ALK variants may be associated with the  development of ALK resistance mutations, particularly G1202R, and provide a  molecular link between variant and clinical outcome. ALK variant thus represents  a potentially important factor in the selection of next-generation ALK  inhibitors.', 'Lung toxicity is a potential fatal effect involving non-small-cell lung cancer  (NSCLC) patients exposed to tyrosine kinase inhibitors (TKIs). Moving from our  experience regarding a patient who developed lung toxicity while receiving 2  different anaplastic lymphoma kinase (ALK)-TKIs, we performed a systematic  review to assess the epidemiologic magnitude and the clinical significance of  such toxicity in NSCLC patients treated with ALK-TKIs. Studies were identified  using MEDLINE and additional sources (European Society for Medical Oncology,  American Society of Clinical Oncology, and World Conference on Lung Cancer  abstracts) in agreement with Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews  and Meta-Analyses and Cochrane guidelines. Lung toxicity was reported in 105 of  4943 NSCLC patients (2.1%). Crizotinib was responsible for pulmonary adverse  events (AEs) in 1.8% of exposed patients (49 of 2706). With the limit of a lower  number of treated patients (n\xa0= 359), brigatinib resulted as the most frequently  involved in lung toxicity (7%; n\xa0= 25). Pulmonary AEs during therapy with  ceritinib, alectinib, and lorlatinib occurred in 1.1%, 2.6%, and 1.8% of the  patients, respectively. Sixty-five percent of cases accounted for Grade 3 or 4  events, with a mortality rate of 9%. Radiological patterns of pneumonia were  reported in 25 patients, whereas imaging evocative of interstitial lung disease  in 37. Overall, 26 of 105 patients (25%) permanently discontinued treatment  because of lung toxicity. Lung toxicity is a rare albeit potentially severe side  effect in NSCLC patients receiving ALK-TKIs, apparently more frequent with  brigatinib. Its early recognition and treatment are crucial for the best outcome  of this subgroup of patients, whose overall prognosis is being improved by the  availability of several targeted agents.', 'Lysosomal acid lipase (LAL) is a critical neutral lipid metabolic enzyme that  regulates metabolic reprogramming in myeloid-derived suppressor cells (MDSCs)  through over-activation of mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR). Affymetrix  GeneChip microarray analysis of MDSCs from LAL deficient mouse (lal-/-) revealed  upregulation of Rab7 GTPase protein, which belongs to a superfamily of  small-molecular-weight GTPase known to regulate intracellular membrane  trafficking from early to late endosomes and lysosomes. Here, the physical  protein-protein interaction between Rab7 GTPase and mTOR has been detected by  co-immunoprecipitation in the cell extract of wild type HD1A and lal-/-  MDSC-like HD1B myeloid cell lines. The GST pull down assay using the recombinant  GST-Rab7 GTPase fusion protein showed that Rab7 GTPase interacts with the mTOR  N-terminal heat repeat domain. Rab7 GTPase siRNA knocking down reversed the  altered lysosome/mTOR distribution and expression levels in HD1B cells. Rab7  GTPase siRNA knocking down in isolated bone marrow lal-/- MDSCs or HD1B cells  not only reduced over-activation of mTOR and its downstream effector S6, but  also decreased glucose consumption, decreased ROS over-production, and increased  healthy mitochondria by membrane potential measurement. Inhibition of Rab7  GTPase led to reduced lal-/- MDSCs differentiation from bone marrow Lin-  progenitor cells, reduced lal-/- MDSCs trans-endothelial migration, and reversed  lal-/- MDSCs suppression of T cell proliferation. Furthermore, inhibition of  Rab7 GTPase reduced lal-/- MDSCs ability to stimulate tumor cell proliferation  in vitro, tumor growth in vivo, and tumor invasion. Together, these results  showed that Rab7 GTPase is critically involved in MDSCs homeostasis and  pathogenic functions.', 'PURPOSE: Non-small cell lung cancers (NSCLCs) harboring ALK gene rearrangements  (ALK+) typically become resistant to the first-generation anaplastic lymphoma  kinase (ALK) tyrosine kinase inhibitor (TKI) crizotinib through development of  secondary resistance mutations in ALK or disease progression in the brain.  Mutations that confer resistance to second-generation ALK TKIs ceritinib and  alectinib have also been identified. Here, we report the structure and first  comprehensive preclinical evaluation of the next-generation ALK TKI brigatinib. EXPERIMENTAL DESIGN: A kinase screen was performed to evaluate the selectivity  profile of brigatinib. The cellular and in vivo activities of ALK TKIs were  compared using engineered and cancer-derived cell lines. The brigatinib-ALK  co-structure was determined. RESULTS: Brigatinib potently inhibits ALK and ROS1, with a high degree of  selectivity over more than 250 kinases. Across a panel of ALK+ cell lines,  brigatinib inhibited native ALK (IC50, 10 nmol/L) with 12-fold greater potency  than crizotinib. Superior efficacy of brigatinib was also observed in mice with  ALK+ tumors implanted subcutaneously or intracranially. Brigatinib maintained  substantial activity against all 17 secondary ALK mutants tested in cellular  assays and exhibited a superior inhibitory profile compared with crizotinib,  ceritinib, and alectinib at clinically achievable concentrations. Brigatinib was  the only TKI to maintain substantial activity against the most recalcitrant ALK  resistance mutation, G1202R. The unique, potent, and pan-ALK mutant activity of  brigatinib could be rationalized by structural analyses. CONCLUSIONS: Brigatinib is a highly potent and selective ALK inhibitor. These  findings provide the molecular basis for the promising activity being observed  in ALK+, crizotinib-resistant patients with NSCLC being treated with brigatinib  in clinical trials.

Recent studies using Tpl2 knockout mice  have indicated an important role for Tpl2 in the lipopolysaccharide (LPS)  induced production of tumor necrosis factor alpha (TNF-alpha) and other  proinflammatory cytokines involved in diseases such as rheumatoid arthritis.  Initial 4-anilino-6-aminoquinoline-3-carbonitrile leads showed poor selectivity  for Tpl2 over epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) kinase. Using molecular  modeling and crystallographic data of the EGFR kinase domain with and without an  EGFR kinase-specific 4-anilinoquinazoline inhibitor (erlotinib, Tarceva), we  hypothesized that we could diminish the inhibition of EGFR kinase by  substitution at the C-8 position of our  4-anilino-6-aminoquinoline-3-carbonitrile leads. The  8-substituted-4-anilino-6-aminoquinoline-3-carbonitriles were prepared from the  appropriate 2-substituted 4-nitroanilines. Modifications to the C-6 and C-8  positions led to the identification of compounds with increased inhibition of  TNF-alpha release from LPS-stimulated rat and human blood, and these analogues  were also highly selective for Tpl2 kinase over EGFR kinase. Further  structure-activity based modifications led to the identification of  8-bromo-4-(3-chloro-4-fluorophenylamino)-6-[(1-methyl-1H-imidazol-4-yl)methylamino]quinoline-3-carbonitrile,  which demonstrated in vitro as well as in vivo efficacy in inhibition of  LPS-induced TNF-alpha production.', ""PURPOSE: Small-molecule inhibitors of Aurora A (AAK) and B (ABK) kinases, which  play important roles in mitosis, are currently being pursued in oncology  clinical trials. We developed three novel assays to quantitatively measure  biomarkers of AAK inhibition in vivo. Here, we describe preclinical  characterization of alisertib (MLN8237), a selective AAK inhibitor,  incorporating these novel pharmacodynamic assays. EXPERIMENTAL DESIGN: We investigated the selectivity of alisertib for AAK and  ABK and studied the antitumor and antiproliferative activity of alisertib in  vitro and in vivo. Novel assays were used to assess chromosome alignment and  mitotic spindle bipolarity in human tumor xenografts using immunofluorescent  detection of DNA and alpha-tubulin, respectively. In addition,  18F-3'-fluoro-3'-deoxy-l-thymidine positron emission tomography (FLT-PET) was  used to noninvasively measure effects of alisertib on in vivo tumor cell  proliferation. RESULTS: Alisertib inhibited AAK over ABK with a selectivity of more than  200-fold in cells and produced a dose-dependent decrease in bipolar and aligned  chromosomes in the HCT-116 xenograft model, a phenotype consistent with AAK  inhibition. Alisertib inhibited proliferation of human tumor cell lines in vitro  and produced tumor growth inhibition in solid tumor xenograft models and  regressions in in vivo lymphoma models. In addition, a dose of alisertib that  caused tumor stasis, as measured by volume, resulted in a decrease in FLT  uptake, suggesting that noninvasive imaging could provide value over traditional  measurements of response. CONCLUSIONS: Alisertib is a selective and potent inhibitor of AAK. The novel  methods of measuring Aurora A pathway inhibition and application of tumor  imaging described here may be valuable for clinical evaluation of small-molecule  inhibitors."", 'Netherton syndrome is caused by loss-of-function mutations in SPINK5 encoding  the Kazal-type inhibitor LEKTI-1 leading to dysregulation of proteolytic  cascades involving several kallikreins. We used both structure-based and  ligand-based virtual screening computations to identify commercially available  non-covalent inhibitors of human kallikrein 5 (hK5), a serine protease  (trypsin-like) that plays a central role in the initiation of the molecular  cascades leading to the Netherton syndrome phenotype. The efficacy and mechanism  of inhibition of the identified new families of organic compounds were analyzed  not only for hK5 but also on other proteases implicated in the cascades (hK7,  hK14 and matriptase). These inhibitors are nontoxic on healthy human  keratinocytes and are structurally different from traditional serine protease  inhibitors validating their potential utility as initial hits to control  proteolytic disorders observed in dermatological pathologies such as Netherton  syndrome.']",Lorlatinib is anaplastic lymphoma kinase inhibitor.
116,What is the mode of action of dexamethasone?,"['Glucocorticoids (GCs) are potent anti-inflammatory drugs whose mode of action is  complex and still debatable. One likely cellular target of GCs are  monocytes/macrophages. The role of GCs in monocyte survival is also debated.  Although both granulocyte macrophage-colony stimulating factor (GM-CSF) and  macrophage-CSF (M-CSF) are important regulators of macrophage lineage functions  including their survival, the former is often associated with proinflammatory  functions while the latter is important in lineage homeostasis. We report here  that the GC, dexamethasone, induces apoptosis in GM-CSF-treated human monocytes  while having no impact on M-CSF-induced monocyte survival. To understand how  GCs, GM-CSF, and M-CSF are regulating monocyte survival and other functions  during inflammation, we firstly examined the transcriptomic changes elicited by  these three agents in human monocytes, either acting alone or in combination.  Transcriptomic and Ingenuity pathway analyses found that dexamethasone  differentially modulated dendritic cell maturation and TREM1 signaling pathways  in GM-CSF-treated and M-CSF-treated monocytes, two pathways known to be  regulated by ERK1/2 activity. These analyses led us to provide evidence that the  GC inhibits ERK1/2 activity selectively in GM-CSF-treated monocytes to induce  apoptosis. It is proposed that this inhibition of ERK1/2 activity leads to  inactivation of p90 ribosomal-S6 kinase and Bad dephosphorylation leading in  turn to enhanced caspase-3 activity and subsequent apoptosis. Furthermore,  pharmacological inhibition of GC receptor activity restored the ERK1/2 signaling  and prevented the GC-induced apoptosis in GM-CSF-treated monocytes. Increased  tissue macrophage numbers, possibly from enhanced survival due to mediators such  as GM-CSF, can correlate with inflammatory disease severity; also reduction in  these numbers can correlate with the therapeutic benefit of a number of agents,  including GCs. We propose that the ERK1/2 signaling pathway promotes survival of  GM-CSF-treated proinflammatory monocytes, which can be selectively targeted by  GCs as a novel mechanism to reduce local monocyte/macrophage numbers and hence  inflammation.', ""Reducing reperfusion injury is effective in reducing flap loss after prolonged  ischemia. Anti-inflammatory therapy reduces reperfusion injury in canine cardiac  muscle and ex vivo rat cremaster muscle; however, to date, there are no studies  involving the use of anti-inflammatory agents in ischemic skin flaps. This study  was designed to assess the effects of dexamethasone and indomethacin on the  viability of rat island groin flaps subjected to 10 hours of ischemia. The  ischemic control and the treatment group flaps were subjected to 10 hours of  ischemia by clamping the inferior epigastric vascular pedicle. The treatment  groups received either intravenous dexamethasone or intravenous indomethacin  after the flap vascular pedicles were clamped. Our results showed significant  improvement (p < 0.05, Fisher's exact test) in ischemic flap survival using  dexamethasone. The specific mode of action of dexamethasone was not  investigated; however, its anti-inflammatory effects were most likely  responsible for the improvement of flap survival by suppressing the circulating  neutrophil and decreasing reperfusion injury. Dexamethasone is easily available  for clinical use, and its use should be considered in cases of prolonged  ischemia in skin flaps."", 'Bone morphogenetic protein-2 (BMP-2) is considered one of the most effective and  extensively used growth factors to induce osteoblast differentiation and  accelerate bone regeneration. Dexamethasone (Dex) with suitable dosage can  enhance BMP-2-induced osteoblast differentiation. To strengthen this synergistic  osteoinductive effect, a pH-responsive chitosan-functionalized mesoporous silica  nanoparticle (chi-MSN) ensemble was fabricated for dual-delivery of BMP-2 and  Dex. The MSNs are prepared by a CTAB-templated sol-gel method, and further  coated by chitosan via the crosslinking of glycidoxypropyltrimethoxysilane  (GPTMS). The small Dex is encapsulated in the mesopores and the large BMP-2 is  incorporated into the chitosan coating. These chi-MSNs can quickly release BMP-2  in a bioactive form and can then be efficiently endocytosed and further realize  a controlled release of Dex with the decreased pH value into/in cells. With the  synergistic action of BMP-2 and Dex outside and inside the cell, this dual  hybrid delivery system can significantly stimulate osteoblast differentiation  and bone regeneration in vitro and in vivo. Together, this dual-delivery  strategy for osteogenic protein delivery may enhance clinical outcomes by  retaining the bioactivity and optimizing the release mode of the drug/protein.', 'Inflammation is a physiological process involved in many diseases. Monitoring  proteins involved in regulatory effects may help to improve our understanding of  inflammation. We have analyzed proteome alterations induced in peripheral blood  mononuclear cells (PBMCs) upon inflammatory activation in great detail using  high-resolution mass spectrometry. Moreover, the activated cells were treated  with dexamethasone to investigate their response to this antiphlogistic drug.  From a total of 6886 identified proteins, 469 proteins were significantly  regulated upon inflammatory activation. Data are available via ProteomeXchange  with identifiers PXD001415-23. Most of these proteins were counter-regulated by  dexamethasone, with some exceptions concerning members of the interferon-induced  protein family. To confirm some of these results, we performed targeted MRM  analyses of selected peptides. The inflammation-induced upregulation of proteins  such as IL-1β, IL-6, CXCL2, and GROα was confirmed, however, with strong  quantitative interindividual differences. Furthermore, the inability of  dexamethasone to downregulate inflammation-induced proteins such as PTX3 and  TSG6 was clearly demonstrated. In conclusion, the relation of cell function as  well as drug-induced modulation thereof was successfully mapped to proteomes,  suggesting targeted analysis as a novel and powerful drug evaluation method.  Although most consequences of dexamethasone were found to be compatible with the  expected mode of action, some unexpected but significant observations may be  related to adverse effects.', 'PURPOSE: Atrial fibrillation (AF) results in tachycardia-induced ionic  remodeling. Pharmacological prevention of tachycardia-induced ionic remodeling  not only with ""classical"" antiarrhythmics but also with drugs which provide a  basis for some of the pillars of the so-called ""upstream"" therapy of AF like  corticosteroids or statins has been proposed as a therapeutic strategy. Amongst  other ion currents, atrial sodium current I(Na) and its tachycardia-induced  alterations play an important role in AF pathophysiology. Thus, effects of a  dexamethasone (DT) and atorvastatin treatment (AT) on atrial sodium current  I(Na) and its tachycardia-induced remodeling were studied in a rabbit model. METHODS: 9 groups with 4 animals were examined. Atrial pacemaker leads were  implanted in all animals. No rapid atrial pacing (600/min) was performed in the  control group but for 24 or 120 hours in the respective pacing groups.  Instrumentation and pacing did not differ from the respective drug groups but an  additional treatment with dexamethasone or atorvastatin (7 days) was performed. RESULTS: Rapid atrial pacing (RAP, 600/min) reduced I(Na) after 24 hours (≈  -50%) with no further reduction after 120 hours. DT reduced I(Na) (≈ -20%),  current densities in consecutively tachypaced animals did not differ from those  in untreated animals. AT reduced INa similar as RAP, subsequent RAP did not  further diminish I(Na). CONCLUSIONS: Impact of corticosteroids and statins on INa and its  tachycardia-induced alterations also contribute to the mode of action of these  substances in upstream treatment of atrial fibrillation.', 'Glucocorticoids (GCs) act through the glucocorticoid receptor (GR, also known as  NR3C1) to regulate immunity, energy metabolism and tissue repair. Upon ligand  binding, activated GR mediates cellular effects by regulating gene expression,  but some GR effects can occur rapidly without new transcription. Here, we show  that GCs rapidly inhibit cell migration, in response to both GR agonist and  antagonist ligand binding. The inhibitory effect on migration is prevented by GR  knockdown with siRNA, confirming GR specificity, but not by actinomycin D  treatment, suggesting a non-transcriptional mechanism. We identified a rapid  onset increase in microtubule polymerisation following GC treatment, identifying  cytoskeletal stabilisation as the likely mechanism of action. HDAC6  overexpression, but not knockdown of αTAT1, rescued the GC effect, implicating  HDAC6 as the GR effector. Consistent with this hypothesis, ligand-dependent  cytoplasmic interaction between GR and HDAC6 was demonstrated by quantitative  imaging. Taken together, we propose that activated GR inhibits HDAC6 function,  and thereby increases the stability of the microtubule network to reduce cell  motility. We therefore report a novel, non-transcriptional mechanism whereby GCs  impair cell motility through inhibition of HDAC6 and rapid reorganization of the  cell architecture.This article has an associated First Person interview with the  first author of the paper.', 'BACKGROUND: Tonsillectomy is associated with postoperative nausea and vomiting  (PONV) if no prophylaxis is administered. Previous studies have shown that a  single dose of dexamethasone decreases the incidence of PONV. The most effective  dose of dexamethasone to affect clinical outcome is yet to be defined. METHODS: One-hundred-twenty-five children were enrolled in a double-blind,  prospective, randomized, dose-escalating study of dexamethasone: 0.0625, 0.125,  0.25, 0.5, or 1 mg/kg, maximum dose 24 mg. Nonparametric ANOVA was used to  analyze the incidence of vomiting by treatment group for 0 to < or =5 h, >5 to  24 h. The Cox Proportional Likelihood Ratio Test was used to compare the time of  first vomit and time to first pain medication across treatment groups. RESULTS: There was no difference in the incidence of vomiting for the five  escalating doses of dexamethasone in the time period. There were no differences  in secondary outcomes (analgesic requirements, time to first liquid, and change  in voice) across treatment groups. CONCLUSION: We conclude that the lowest dose of dexamethasone (0.0625 mg/kg) was  as effective as the highest dose of dexamethasone (1.0 mg/kg) for preventing  PONV or reducing the incidence of other secondary outcomes following  tonsillectomy or adenotonsillectomy. There is no justification for the use of  high-dose dexamethasone for the prevention of PONV in this cohort of children.', ""Reducing reperfusion injury is effective in reducing flap loss after prolonged  ischemia.

In the present  study, we used an in vitro model to examine the requirement for protein  synthesis for dexamethasone to suppress the release of immunoreactive (ir)-PRL  release from the rat pituitary gland. In addition we have performed a series of  in vitro and in vivo experiments to investigate the potential role in this  regard of lipocortin 1 (LC1), a protein shown previously not only to mediate  aspects of the anti-inflammatory and anti-proliferative actions of the  glucocorticoids but also to contribute to the regulatory actions of the steroids  in the brain-neuroendocrine system. In vitro, the release of ir-PRL from rat  anterior pituitary tissue initiated by submaximal concentrations of VIP (10 nM).  TRH (10 nM) or the adenyl cyclase activator forskolin (100 microM) was reduced  significantly (p < 0.01) by preincubation (2 h) of the tissue with dexamethasone  (0.1 microM). By contrast, ir-PRL release evoked by a submaximal concentration  of the L-Ca2+ channel opener BAY K8644 (10 microM) was unaffected by the steroid  although readily antagonised (p < 0.01) by nifedipine (1-100 microM). Exposure  of the pituitary tissue to dexamethasone (0.1 microM) also caused a pronounced  and highly significant increase in de novo protein synthesis, as assessed by the  incorporation of 14C-lysine into the tissue (p < 0.001). This response was  reduced markedly by the inclusion of the RNA and protein synthesis inhibitors,  actinomycin-D (0.5 micrograms/ml) or cycloheximide (1.0 micrograms/ml), in the  incubation medium (p < 0.001), both of which also effectively abrogated (p <  0.01) the dexamethasone-induced inhibition of the release of ir-PRL evoked by  TRH. VIP and forskolin. Lipocortin I was readily detectable by Western blotting  in protein extracts of freshly excised anterior pituitary tissue: a small  proportion of the protein was found to be attached to the outer surface of the  cells where it was retained by a Ca(2+)-dependent mechanism. Exposure of the  tissue in vitro to dexamethasone (0.1 microM) or corticosterone (0.1 microM) but  not 17 beta-oestradiol (0.1 microM) caused a pronounced increase in the amount  of LC1 attached to the outer surface of the cells and concomitant decrease in  the LC1 content of the intracellular LC1 pool. Addition of an N-terminal LC1  fragment. LC11-188 (10 pg-10 ng/ml), to the incubation medium reduced  significantly (p < 0.01) the increases in ir-PRL release induced in vitro by VIP  (10 nM) and forskolin (100 microM). By contrast, at all concentrations tested.  LC11-188 (10 pg-10 ng/ml) failed to influence (p < 0.05) the highly significant  (p < 0.01) ir-PRL response to TRH (10 nM). Similarly, the inhibitory actions of  dexamethasone (0.1 microM) on the release of ir-PRL induced by VIP (10 nM) or  forskolin (100 microM) but not by TRH (10 nM) were substantially reversed (p <  0.01) by a specific monoclonal anti-LC1 antibody while an isotype-matched  control antibody was without effect. In vivo, rats pretreated with either a  polyclonal anti LC1 antiserum (anti-LC1 pAb, 1 ml/day s.c. for 2 days) or a  corresponding volume of non-immune sheep serum (NSS) responded to stress  (laparotomy under ether anaesthesia) with significant (p < 0.05) increases in  the serum ir-PRL concentration. In the NSS-treated group, the ir-PRL response to  stress was effectively inhibited by dexamethasone (100 micrograms/kg i.p.) which  had no effect on the pre-stress serum ir-PRL concentration. By contrast, in rats  pretreated with anti-LC1 pAb dexamethasone failed to block the stress-induced  release of ir-PRL. The results show clearly that the inhibitory actions of  dexamethasone on PRL release are dependent on de novo protein synthesis and  provide novel evidence for the involvement of both LC1-dependent and  LC1-independent mechanisms.', 'Immune cells invading the central nervous system (CNS) in response to Borna  disease virus (BDV) antigens are central to the pathogenesis of Borna disease  (BD). We speculate that the response of the resident cells of the brain to  infection may be involved in the sensitization and recruitment of these  inflammatory cells. To separate the responses of resident cells from those of  cells infiltrating from the periphery, we used dexamethasone to inhibit  inflammatory reactions in BD. Treatment with dexamethasone prevented the  development of clinical signs of BD, and the brains of treated animals showed no  neuropathological lesions and a virtual absence of markers of inflammation, cell  infiltration, or activation normally seen in the CNS of BDV-infected rats. In  contrast, treatment with dexamethasone exacerbated the expression of BDV RNA,  which was paralleled by a similarly elevated expression of mRNAs for egr-1,  c-fos, and c-jun. Furthermore, dexamethasone failed to inhibit the increase in  expression of mRNAs for tumor necrosis factor alpha, macrophage inflammatory  protein 1 beta, interleukin 6, and mob-1, which occurs in the CNS of animals  infected with BDV. Our findings suggest that these genes, encoding transcription  factors, chemokines, and proinflammatory cytokines, might be directly activated  in CNS resident cells by BDV. This result supports the hypothesis that the  initial phase of the inflammatory response to BDV infection in the brain may be  dependent upon virus-induced activation of CNS resident cells.']","Glucocorticoids like Dexamethasone have a number of modes of action. While these drugs are used to reduce inflammation, Dexamethasone can also  induce apoptosis thru initiation of autophagy, activate glucocorticoid receptors in the treatment of uveitic edema, alter gene expression in allergic asthma prevent tachycardia-induced ionic remodeling by reduction of atrial sodium current I(Na), increase gut permeability and suppress inflammation. in addition,  Dexamethasone (Dex) can enhance BMP-2-induced osteoblast differentiation and can differentially modulated dendritic cell maturation and TREM1 signaling pathways in GM-CSF-treated and M-CSF-treated monocytes. Dexamethasone can be used for pain management"
117,Which are the major phycobiliproteins present in cyanobacteria?,"['Phycoerythrin is a major light-harvesting pigment of red algae and cyanobacteria  widely used as a fluorescent probe. In this study, phycoerythrin of the red  macroalga Palmaria palmata was extracted by grinding the algal sample in liquid  nitrogen, homogenisation in phosphate buffer and centrifugation. Phycoerythrin  was then purified from this crude extract using preparative polyacrylamide gel  electrophoresis (PAGE) with a continuous elution system and detected by its pink  colour and fluorescence. The pigment presented a typical spectrum of  R-phycoerythrin, with three absorbance maxima at 499, 545 and 565 nm, and  displayed a fluorescence maximum at 578 nm. The absorbance ratio A565/A280, a  criterion for purity, was 3.2. A single protein of relative molecular mass  240,000 was detected on native-PAGE with silver staining. Sodium dodecyl  sulphate-PAGE demonstrated the presence of two major subunits with Mr 20,000 and  21,000, respectively, and a very minor subunit of Mr 30,000. These observations  are consistent with the (alphabeta)6gamma subunit composition characteristic of  R-phycoerythrin. Phycoerythrin of Palmaria palmata was determined to be present  in larger amounts in autumn and showed a good stability up to 60 degrees C and  between pH 3.5 and 9.5. In conclusion, phycoerythrin of Palmaria palmata was  purified in a single-step using preparative PAGE. Obtaining pure R-phycoerythrin  of Palmaria palmata will allow one to evaluate its fluorescence properties for  future applications in biochemical techniques.', 'The phycobilisome of the eukaryotic unicellular red alga Rhodella violacea  presents in some respects an organization that is intermediate between those of  the homologous counterparts found in cyanobacteria (the putative chloroplast  progenitor) and more advanced, pluricellular red algae. This suggests  evolutionary relationships that we investigated at the genome level. The present  work describes the sequences of two rhodophytan phycobilisome genes, rpeA and  rpeB. These chloroplast genes encode the alpha and beta subunits of  phycoerythrin, the major component of the light-harvesting antennae and one of  the most abundant cellular proteins in these algae. The amino acid sequences  deduced from both rpeA and rpeB present strong homologies with those previously  reported for phycoerythrin subunits of cyanobacteria, rhodophyta, and  cryptomonads. The main difference with the corresponding cyanobacterial genes  was the unexpected occurrence of an intervening sequence that split rpeB into  two exons. This intervening sequence presents characteristics of group II  introns but lacks several structural domains. Transcriptional analyses showed  that the two rpe genes are cotranscribed and that the major RNA species detected  corresponds to a mature mRNA lacking the intron. As the phycobiliproteins form a  group of closely related polypeptides in cyanobacteria and rhodophyta, the  molecular events affecting the corresponding genes, such as the rpeB intron, may  be a clue to elucidate some aspects of the molecular processes involved in the  evolution of plastid genes.', 'Synechococcus 6301 mutant, strain AN112, produces phycobilisomes containing two  major biliproteins, phycocyanin and allophycocyanin, and two major linker  polypeptides of 27 and 75 kilodaltons (27K and 75K). These phycobilisomes have a  molecular weight of approximately 2.5 X 10(6) and are the smallest of these  particles known to date. Sucrose density gradient centrifugation of AN112  phycobilisomes partially dissociated in 50 mM  N-[tris(hydroxymethyl)methyl]glycine, 5 mM CaCl2, 10% (w/v) glycerol, pH 7.8,  separated three distinct fractions: (1) free trimeric biliproteins, (2)  hexameric complexes of phycocyanin with 27K (11 S particles), and (3)  phycobilisome subassemblies equivalent in mass to approximately 25% of the  intact phycobilisome (18 S particles). The 18 S particles contained equimolar  amounts of phycocyanin and allophycocyanin, which represented approximately 30  and 50%, respectively, of the content of these biliproteins in the AN112  phycobilisome. The 18 S particles also contained 75% and 100%, respectively, of  27K and 75K polypeptides; i.e. 75K was present in a 2-fold higher amount than in  the intact phycobilisome. The absorption spectrum (lambda max 648 nm) of the 18  S particles was similar to that of allophycocyanin. Upon excitation at 580 nm,  these particles exhibited a fluorescence emission spectrum consisting of 680 and  660 nm components, identical with that of intact phycobilisomes. The circular  dichroism spectra of AN112 phycobilisomes and of the 18 S particles, in the  region between 650 and 700 nm, were also very similar. Allophycocyanin B, which  fluoresces at 680 nm, was found in fraction 1, and was totally absent from the  18 S particle. Thus, the long wavelength emission of the 18 S particle must have  arisen from another terminal energy acceptor. The most probable candidate is the  75K polypeptide, which has been shown to carry a bilin chromophore and emit near  680 nm (Lundell, D. J., Yamanaka, G., and Glazer, A. N. (1980) J. Cell Biol. 91,  315-319). The 27K polypeptide, present in both fractions 2 and 3, was a  component of different complexes in the two fractions. Fraction 2 displayed the  physical and spectroscopic properties characteristic of the phycocyanin-linker  complex, (alpha beta)6.27K. However, in the 18 S particle, 27K functioned in the  assembly and attachment of phycocyanin trimers to a core domain. Based on the  analysis of the components in fractions 1-3, a model is proposed which describes  the structure of the AN112 phycobilisome, with emphasis on the roles of the  linker polypeptides in the assembly of the core.', 'C-Phycocyanin (C-Pc) is one of the major biliprotein pigments of unicellular  cyanbacterium of Spirulina platenesis, it has nutritional, medicinal, and  hepatoprotectant application. The growth and multiplication of human hepatoma  cell lines (HepG2) under the effect of different concentrations of C-PC (0.8,  1.75, 3.5 and 7.0 microg/ml) against untreated cells as control for 24h were  investigated. The results showed that the proliferating cells in presence of  C-PC reached 70, 51, 44, and 39%, respectively. The results revealed that the  greatest reduction in proliferation of cells was recorded at 7.0 microg/ml and  LC50 at 1.75 microg/ml of C-PC. In parallel, to the previous results  HCl-denatured MG-P revealed that in mass of cells there is a pattern of  apoptosis because the expanded cytoplasmic area (bluish-green) reduced and  appeared faintly red as C-PC concentration increased. Moreover, the cells lost  all the nuclear entities then, become fragmented and having no nuclear remnants.  The C-PC may be a new potential anti-cancer drug for therapy of human hepatoma  cells.', 'The polypeptide composition of the phycobilisome, the major light-harvesting  complex of prokaryotic cyanobacteria and certain eukaryotic algae, can be  modulated by different light qualities in cyanobacteria exhibiting chromatic  adaptation. We have identified genomic fragments encoding a cluster of  phycobilisome polypeptides (phycobiliproteins) from the chromatically adapting  cyanobacterium Fremyella diplosiphon using previously characterized DNA  fragments of phycobiliprotein genes from the eukaryotic alga Cyanophora paradoxa  and from F. diplosiphon. Characterization of two lambda-EMBL3 clones containing  overlapping genomic fragments indicates that three sets of phycobiliprotein  genes--the alpha- and beta-allophycocyanin genes plus two sets of alpha- and  beta-phycocyanin genes--are clustered within 13 kilobases on the cyanobacterial  genome and transcribed off the same strand. The gene order  (alpha-allophycocyanin followed by beta-allophycocyanin and beta-phycocyanin  followed by alpha-phycocyanin) appears to be a conserved arrangement found  previously in a eukaryotic alga and another cyanobacterium. We have reported  that one set of phycocyanin genes is transcribed as two abundant red  light-induced mRNAs (1600 and 3800 bases). We now present data showing that the  allophycocyanin genes and a second set of phycocyanin genes are transcribed into  major mRNAs of 1400 and 1600 bases, respectively. These transcripts are present  in RNA isolated from cultures grown in red and green light, although lower  levels of the 1600-base phycocyanin transcript are present in cells grown in  green light. Furthermore, a larger transcript of 1750 bases hybridizes to the  allophycocyanin genes and may be a precursor to the 1400-base species.', 'BACKGROUND: Marine Synechococcus owe their specific vivid color (ranging from  blue-green to orange) to their large extrinsic antenna complexes called  phycobilisomes, comprising a central allophycocyanin core and rods of variable  phycobiliprotein composition. Three major pigment types can be defined depending  on the major phycobiliprotein found in the rods (phycocyanin, phycoerythrin I or  phycoerythrin II). Among strains containing both phycoerythrins I and II, four  subtypes can be distinguished based on the ratio of the two chromophores bound  to these phycobiliproteins. Genomes of eleven marine Synechococcus strains  recently became available with one to four strains per pigment type or subtype,  allowing an unprecedented comparative genomics study of genes involved in  phycobilisome metabolism. RESULTS: By carefully comparing the Synechococcus genomes, we have retrieved  candidate genes potentially required for the synthesis of phycobiliproteins in  each pigment type. This includes linker polypeptides, phycobilin lyases and a  number of novel genes of uncharacterized function. Interestingly, strains  belonging to a given pigment type have similar phycobilisome gene complements  and organization, independent of the core genome phylogeny (as assessed using  concatenated ribosomal proteins). While phylogenetic trees based on concatenated  allophycocyanin protein sequences are congruent with the latter, those based on  phycocyanin and phycoerythrin notably differ and match the Synechococcus pigment  types. CONCLUSION: We conclude that the phycobilisome core has likely evolved together  with the core genome, while rods must have evolved independently, possibly by  lateral transfer of phycobilisome rod genes or gene clusters between  Synechococcus strains, either via viruses or by natural transformation, allowing  rapid adaptation to a variety of light niches.', 'An extensive range of pigments including phycobiliproteins are present in algae.  C-phycocyanin (C-PC), a phycobiliprotein, is one of the key pigments of  Spirulina, a microalgae used in many countries as a dietary supplement. Algal  pigments have massive commercial value as natural colorants in nutraceutical,  cosmetics, and pharmaceutical industries, besides their health benefits. At  present, increasing awareness of harmful effects of synthetic compounds and  inclination of community towards the usage of natural products have led to the  exploitation of microalgae as a source of natural pigments/colors. This review  describes recent findings about the sources and production of C-PC, with  emphasis on specific techniques for extraction and purification, along with  potential industrial applications in diagnostics, foods, cosmetics, and  pharmaceutical industries.', 'Unicellular cryptophyte algae employ antenna proteins with phycobilin  chromophores in their photosynthetic machinery. The mechanism of light  harvesting in these organisms is significantly different than the energy  funneling processes in phycobilisomes utilized by cyanobacteria and red algae.  One of the most striking features of cryptophytes is the location of the  water-soluble phycobiliproteins, which are contained within the intrathylakoid  spaces and are not on the stromal side of the lamellae as in the red algae and  cyanobacteria. Studies of mobility of phycobiliproteins at the lumenal side of  the thylakoid membranes and how their diffusional behavior may influence the  energy funneling steps in light harvesting are reported. Confocal microscopy and  fluorescence recovery after photobleaching (FRAP) are used to measure the  diffusion coefficient of phycoerythrin 545 (PE545), the primary light harvesting  protein of Rhodomonas CS24, in vivo. It is concluded that the diffusion of PE545  in the lumen is inhibited, suggesting possible membrane association or  aggregation as a potential source of mobility hindrance.', 'Phycoerythrin is a major light-harvesting pigment of red algae and cyanobacteria  that is widely used as a fluorescent probe and analytical reagent. In this  paper, B-phycoerythrin and R-phycocyanin in native state, from the red alga  Porphyridium cruentum were obtained by an inexpensive and simple process. The  best results of this purification procedure were scaled up by a factor of 13 to  a large preparative level using an anionic chromatographic column of DEAE  cellulose. Gradient elution with acetic acid-sodium acetate buffer (pH 5.5) was  used. In these conditions both 32% of B-phycoerythrin and 12% of R-phycocyanin  contained in the biomass of the microalgae was recovered. B-phycoerythrin was  homogeneous as determined by sodium dodecyl sulfate-poly-acrylamide gel  electrophoresis (SDS-PAGE), yielding three migrating bands corresponding to its  three subunits, consistent with the (alpha beta)(6)gamma subunit composition  characteristic of this biliprotein and the spectroscopic characterization of  B-PE (UV-visible absorption and emission spectroscopy; steady-state and  polarization fluorescence), is accompanied. Finally, a preliminary cost analysis  of the recovery process is presented.', 'The phycobilisome of the eukaryotic unicellular red alga Rhodella violacea  presents in some respects an organization that is intermediate between those of  the homologous counterparts found in cyanobacteria (the putative chloroplast  progenitor) and more advanced, pluricellular red algae. This suggests  evolutionary relationships that we investigated at the genome level. The present  work describes the sequences of two rhodophytan phycobilisome genes, rpeA and  rpeB. These chloroplast genes encode the alpha and beta subunits of  phycoerythrin, the major component of the light-harvesting antennae and one of  the most abundant cellular proteins in these algae. The amino acid sequences  deduced from both rpeA and rpeB present strong homologies with those previously  reported for phycoerythrin subunits of cyanobacteria, rhodophyta, and  cryptomonads. The main difference with the corresponding cyanobacterial genes  was the unexpected occurrence of an intervening sequence that split rpeB into  two exons. This intervening sequence presents characteristics of group II  introns but lacks several structural domains. Transcriptional analyses showed  that the two rpe genes are cotranscribed and that the major RNA species detected  corresponds to a mature mRNA lacking the intron. As the phycobiliproteins form a  group of closely related polypeptides in cyanobacteria and rhodophyta, the  molecular events affecting the corresponding genes, such as the rpeB intron, may  be a clue to elucidate some aspects of the molecular processes involved in the  evolution of plastid genes.']","Phycobiliproteins are derived from the photosynthetic apparatus of cyanobacteria and eukaryotic algae, and form their large extrinsic antenna complexes called phycobilisomes. Phycobilisomes have a core composed from allophycocyanin (APC) and rods, which are of variable phycobiliprotein composition. C-Phycocyanin (C-Pc) is one of the major light harvesting biliprotein pigments constitutively produced by many cyanobacteria, such as Spirulina platenesis (a blue-green alga). B-Phycoerythrin (B-PE) is an other major light-harvesting pigment found in red algae and cyanobacteria. R-phycoerythrin (R-PE) is the major light-harvesting pigment protein of most red algal phycobilisomes."
118,Idecabtagene vicleucel can be used for treatment of which disease?,"['BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVE: Registrational trials for ciltacabtagene autoleucel  [cilta-cel]) and idecabtagene vicleucel [ide-cel] chimeric antigen receptor  T-cell (CAR-T) therapies were single-arm studies conducted with relapse  refractory multiple myeloma (MM) patients who were triple-class-exposed (TCE) or  triple-class-refractory (TCR). It is critical for researchers conducting  comparative effectiveness research (CER) to carefully consider the most  appropriate data sources and comparable patient populations. The aim of this  study was to identify potential data sources and populations for comparing to  single-arm CAR-T trials CARTITUDE-1 (cilta-cel) and KarMMa (ide-cel). METHODS: A 2-part global systematic literature search produced a review of (1)  clinical trials of National Comprehensive Cancer Network (NCCN) guideline  preferred regimens in previously treated MM, and (2) real-world data cohorts of  TCE or TCR populations, published between 1/1/2015 and 12/10/2020, with sample  sizes of >\xa050 patients and reporting survival-related outcomes. Implications on  CER and accepted best practices are discussed. RESULTS: Nine clinical trials of NCCN preferred regimens were identified along  with five real-world data-based publications. No clinical trials evaluated  patients with TCE or TCR MM. Among the real-world data-based publications, two  evaluated patients exclusively with TCR MM, two analyzed a mixed population of  patients with TCE or TCR MM, and one publication assessed patients exclusively  with TCE MM. Real-world data treatment patterns were heterogeneous. CONCLUSION: Current NCCN preferred regimens were not specifically studied in TCE  or TCR MM patients, although some studies do include a proportion of these types  of patients. Therefore, appropriate matching of populations using either  real-world data or patient level clinical trial data is critical to putting  trials of novel CAR-Ts (i.e., CARTITUDE-1 or KarMMa) into appropriate  comparative context.', 'Conflict of interest statement: S.J. served as a consultant for Bristol Myers  Squibb (BMS), Janssen, Legend Biotech, Sanofi, and Takeda.

METHODS: In this phase 2 study, we sought to confirm the efficacy and safety of  ide-cel in patients with relapsed and refractory myeloma. Patients with disease  after at least three previous regimens including a proteasome inhibitor, an  immunomodulatory agent, and an anti-CD38 antibody were enrolled. Patients  received ide-cel target doses of 150\u2009×\u2009106 to 450\u2009×\u2009106 CAR-positive (CAR+) T  cells. The primary end point was an overall response (partial response or  better); a key secondary end point was a complete response or better (comprising  complete and stringent complete responses). RESULTS: Of 140 patients enrolled, 128 received ide-cel. At a median follow-up  of 13.3 months, 94 of 128 patients (73%) had a response, and 42 of 128 (33%) had  a complete response or better. Minimal residual disease (MRD)-negative status  (<10-5 nucleated cells) was confirmed in 33 patients, representing 26% of all  128 patients who were treated and 79% of the 42 patients who had a complete  response or better. The median progression-free survival was 8.8 months (95%  confidence interval, 5.6 to 11.6). Common toxic effects among the 128 treated  patients included neutropenia in 117 patients (91%), anemia in 89 (70%), and  thrombocytopenia in 81 (63%). Cytokine release syndrome was reported in 107  patients (84%), including 7 (5%) who had events of grade 3 or higher. Neurotoxic  effects developed in 23 patients (18%) and were of grade 3 in 4 patients (3%);  no neurotoxic effects higher than grade 3 occurred. Cellular kinetic analysis  confirmed CAR+ T cells in 29 of 49 patients (59%) at 6 months and 4 of 11  patients (36%) at 12 months after infusion. CONCLUSIONS: Ide-cel induced responses in a majority of heavily pretreated  patients with refractory and relapsed myeloma; MRD-negative status was achieved  in 26% of treated patients. Almost all patients had grade 3 or 4 toxic effects,  most commonly hematologic toxic effects and cytokine release syndrome.

RECENT FINDINGS: CAB has been investigated both as an oral and an injectable  compound. Recent results show that it has promising properties with regards to  its potential for parenteral maintenance therapy in combination with other  compounds in HIV-infected patients currently suppressed on oral agents, as well  as in preexposure prophylaxis. SUMMARY: The strand transfer integrase inhibitor CAB is currently being  investigated as an intramuscular preparation with a long half-life allowing for  four to eight-weekly injection intervals, and as an oral preparation. The latter  is currently only used in trials for achieving an undetectable viral load in  antiretroviral-naive patients, assessing tolerability, and covering phases of  suboptimal exposure to the parenteral preparation. Phase 2 trials of a dual  regimen of CAB and rilpivirine have demonstrated promising virological activity  in oral as well as in parenteral therapy, which are currently investigated in  phase three trials. Moreover, CAB protected macaques from experimental  simian/human immunodeficiency virus infection and showed promising tolerability  in the first trial in humans for preexposure prophylaxis of HIV infection. CAB  might, therefore, provide the basis of the new treatment paradigm of parenteral  treatment and prevention of HIV infection.', 'Idelalisib (Zydelig) for certain types of leukemia and lymphoma, peginterferon  beta-1a (Plegridy) for relapsing forms of multiple sclerosis, and suvorexant  (Belsomra) for insomnia.', 'PURPOSE: Geographic atrophy (GA), a late stage of age-related macular  degeneration (AMD), is a major cause of blindness. Even while central visual  acuity remains relatively well preserved, GA often causes considerable  compromise of visual function and quality of life. No treatment currently  exists. We evaluated the safety and efficacy of pegcetacoplan, a complement C3  inhibitor, for treatment of GA. DESIGN: Prospective, multicenter, randomized, sham-controlled phase 2 study. PARTICIPANTS: Two hundred forty-six patients with GA. METHODS: Patients with GA were assigned randomly in a 2:2:1:1 ratio to receive  intravitreal injections of 15 mg pegcetacoplan monthly or every other month  (EOM) or sham intravitreal injections monthly or EOM for 12 months with  follow-up at months 15 and 18. Area and growth of GA were measured using fundus  autofluorescence imaging. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: The primary efficacy end point was mean change in square  root GA lesion area from baseline to month 12. Secondary outcome measures  included mean change from baseline in GA lesion area without the square root  transformation, distance of GA lesion from the fovea, best-corrected visual  acuity (BCVA), low-luminance BCVA, and low-luminance visual acuity deficit. The  primary safety end point was the number and severity of treatment-emergent  adverse events. RESULTS: In patients receiving pegcetacoplan monthly or EOM, the GA growth rate  was reduced by 29% (95% confidence interval [CI], 9-49; P\xa0= 0.008) and 20% (95%  CI, 0-40; P\xa0= 0.067) compared with the sham treatment group. Post hoc analysis  showed that the effect was greater in the second 6 months of treatment, with  observed reductions of 45% (P\xa0= 0.0004) and 33% (P\xa0= 0.009) for pegcetacoplan  monthly and EOM, respectively. Two cases of culture-positive endophthalmitis and  1 case of culture-negative endophthalmitis occurred in the pegcetacoplan monthly  group. New-onset investigator-determined exudative AMD was reported more  frequently in pegcetacoplan-treated eyes (18/86 eyes [20.9%] and 7/79 eyes  [8.9%] in monthly and EOM groups, respectively) than in sham-treated eyes (1/81  eyes [1.2%]). CONCLUSIONS: Local C3 inhibition with pegcetacoplan resulted in statistically  significant reductions in the growth of GA compared with sham treatment.

METHODS: Beginning in March 2015, we conducted a randomized, controlled trial of  ZMapp plus the current standard of care as compared with the current standard of  care alone in patients with EVD that was diagnosed in West Africa by  polymerase-chain-reaction (PCR) assay. Eligible patients of any age were  randomly assigned in a 1:1 ratio to receive either the current standard of care  or the current standard of care plus three intravenous infusions of ZMapp (50 mg  per kilogram of body weight, administered every third day). Patients were  stratified according to baseline PCR cycle-threshold value for the virus (≤22  vs. >22) and country of enrollment. Oral favipiravir was part of the current  standard of care in Guinea. The primary end point was mortality at 28 days. RESULTS: A total of 72 patients were enrolled at sites in Liberia, Sierra Leone,  Guinea, and the United States. Of the 71 patients who could be evaluated, 21  died, representing an overall case fatality rate of 30%. Death occurred in 13 of  35 patients (37%) who received the current standard of care alone and in 8 of 36  patients (22%) who received the current standard of care plus ZMapp. The  observed posterior probability that ZMapp plus the current standard of care was  superior to the current standard of care alone was 91.2%, falling short of the  prespecified threshold of 97.5%. Frequentist analyses yielded similar results  (absolute difference in mortality with ZMapp, -15 percentage points; 95%  confidence interval, -36 to 7). Baseline viral load was strongly predictive of  both mortality and duration of hospitalization in all age groups. CONCLUSIONS: In this randomized, controlled trial of a putative therapeutic  agent for EVD, although the estimated effect of ZMapp appeared to be beneficial,  the result did not meet the prespecified statistical threshold for efficacy.

TAS-102 (FTD/TPI) is a new oral  anti-tumour agent composed of a nucleoside analogue, trifluridine, and a  thymidine phosphorylase inhibitor, tipiracil, indicated for patients with mCRC  who are refractory to standard therapies. This study summarizes published and  unpublished experience with FTD/TPI in clinical practice settings. Patients and  methods: The Medline/PubMed, Embase and Cochrane Library databases were searched  to identify observational studies on FTD/TPI monotherapy for mCRC. Papers  describing use of FTD/TPI monotherapy outside clinical trials in series of  patients evaluable for effectiveness were eligible. The outcomes of interest  were median progression free survival (mPFS), median overall survival (mOS) as  well as mean PFS time restricted to six months (PFS6m) and mean OS time  restricted to one year (OS1y). Results of the pooled analyses of observational  studies were compared to the results of the Japanese phase II trial and the two  phase III trials, RECOURSE and TERRA. Results: Seven published and two  unpublished studies with 1008 patients from 64 centres were included for  analysis. The pooled mPFS was 2.2 months (95% CI 2.1 to 2.3 months), and the  pooled mOS was 6.6 months (95% CI 6.1 to 7.1 months). PFS6m was 2.9 months (95%  CI 2.6 to 3.1 months) and OS1y was 6.8 (95% CI 6.0 to 7.5) months. While these  results all reflect RECOURSE, the pooled mOS is lower than in the phase II trial  and the OS1y is inferior to both the phase II trial and TERRA. Conclusion: This  systematic review and a meta-analysis indicates that in real life settings, the  survival benefit of FTD/TPI monotherapy in patients with therapy refractory mCRC  reflects the outcomes in RECOURSE but is inferior to outcomes in the two Asian  efficacy trials. What is already known TAS 102 (Lonsurf) is an oral fixed dose  combination of trifluridine (FTD) and tipiracil (TPI) indicated as salvage-line  treatment in patients with therapy refractory metastatic colorectal cancer  (mCRC). A Japanese phase II trial and two phase III trials, RECOURSE and TERRA,  demonstrated that FTD/TPI prolonged overall survival. What this study adds This  systematic review and meta-analysis of real life data from 64 sites indicates  that the effectiveness in daily clinical practice settings of FTD/TPI  monotherapy in late stage mCRC reflects the outcomes in RECOURCE but is inferior  to the outcomes in the Japanese phase II trial and TERRA.', 'TAGS trial revealed the efficacy and safety of  trifluridine/tipiracil(Lonsurf®)treatment in patients with metastatic gastric  cancer following gastrectomy. Here, we successfully treated 38 months survival  case after recurrences following radical gastrectomy for advanced adenocarcinoma  of esophago-gastric junction using historical recommended chemotherapy regimens  and trifluridine/tipiracil as a fifth-line chemotherapy. Trifluridine/tipiracil  therapy contributed to effective and safety treatment even in late-line  chemotherapy for recurrent gastric cancer.', 'Trifluridine/tipiracil or TAS-102 (Taiho Oncology, Lonsurf®, Princeton, NJ, USA)  is a combination tablet of trifluridine, a thymidine-based nucleoside analog,  and tipiracil, a thymidine phosphorylase inhibitor, in a 1:0.5 molar ratio. This  drug was first approved for use in metastatic colorectal cancer patients.  Recently, the U S Food and Drug Administration (FDA) and the European Medicines  Agency (EMA) have granted approval of trifluridine/tipiracil for treatment of  metastatic gastric and gastroesophageal junction adenocarcinoma in patients  following at least two lines of chemotherapy including fluoropyrimidine and  platinum chemotherapy agents, as well as taxanes or irinotecan. This approval  was granted after the findings from first a Phase II trial (EPOC1201)  investigating trifluridine/tipiracil, and later a global Phase III trial (TAGS  trial) that compared trifluridine/tipiracil vs placebo with best supportive  care. Both trials primarily utilized trifluridine/tipiracil at a dose of 35  mg/m2 twice daily. In the EPOC1201 trial, the primary end point of disease  control rate was greater than 50% after eight weeks of therapy. The most common  grade three or four adverse event was neutropenia; additional toxicities  included leukopenia, anemia, and anorexia. In the TAGS trial, overall survival  in patients treated with trifluridine/tipiracil (5.7 months) was significantly  improved as compared to the placebo-controlled group (3.6 months). Treatment  with trifluridine/tipiracil not only did not impair quality of life but also  tended to reduce the risk of deterioration of quality of life. The results of  these studies along with the subsequent FDA and EMA approval have generated an  important breakthrough in regard to treatment options for patients with  refractory metastatic gastric or gastroesophageal junction adenocarcinoma.', 'Trifluridine/tipiracil (Lonsurf(®)) is a novel, orally active, antimetabolite  agent comprised of trifluridine, a thymidine-based nucleoside analogue, and  tipiracil, a potent thymidine phosphorylase inhibitor. Trifluridine is  incorporated into DNA via phosphorylation, ultimately inhibiting cell  proliferation. Tipiracil increases systemic exposure of trifluridine when  coadministered. Trifluridine/tipiracil has recently been approved for the  treatment of adult patients with metastatic colorectal cancer (mCRC) who are  refractory to or are not considered candidates for, current standard  chemotherapy and biological therapy in the EU and USA and in unresectable  advanced or recurrent CRC in Japan. The approved regimen of oral twice-daily  trifluridine/tipiracil (35\xa0mg/m(2) twice daily on days 1-5 and 8-12 of each  28-day cycle) significantly improved overall survival and progression-free  survival and was associated with a significantly higher disease control rate  than placebo when added to best supportive care in the multinational, pivotal  phase III trial (RECOURSE) and a phase II Japanese trial. Trifluridine/tipiracil  was associated with an acceptable tolerability profile, with adverse events  generally being managed with dose reductions, temporary interruptions in  treatment or administration of granulocyte-colony stimulating factor. The most  common grade 3-4 adverse events (≥10\xa0%) were anaemia, neutropenia,  thrombocytopenia and leukopenia. In conclusion, trifluridine/tipiracil is a  useful additional treatment option for the management of mCRC in patients who  are refractory to, or are not considered candidates for, currently available  therapies.', 'Oral naltrexone extended-release/bupropion extended-release (naltrexone  ER/bupropion ER; Contrave(®), Mysimba(™)) is available as an adjunct to a  reduced-calorie diet and increased physical activity in adults with an initial  body mass index (BMI) of ≥ 30 kg/m(2) (i.e. obese) or a BMI of ≥ 27 kg/m(2)  (i.e. overweight) in the presence of at least one bodyweight-related  comorbidity, such as type 2 diabetes mellitus, hypertension or dyslipidaemia. In  56-week phase III trials in these patient populations, oral naltrexone  ER/bupropion ER 32/360 mg/day was significantly more effective than placebo with  regard to percentage bodyweight reductions from baseline and the proportion of  patients who achieved bodyweight reductions of ≥ 5 and ≥ 10%. Significantly  greater improvements in several cardiometabolic risk factors were also observed  with naltrexone ER/bupropion ER versus placebo, as well as greater improvements  in glycated haemoglobin levels in obese or overweight adults with type 2  diabetes. Naltrexone ER/bupropion ER was generally well tolerated in phase III  trials, with nausea being the most common adverse event. Thus, naltrexone  ER/bupropion ER 32/360 mg/day as an adjunct to a reduced-calorie diet and  increased physical activity, is an effective and well tolerated option for  chronic bodyweight management in obese adults or overweight adults with at least  one bodyweight-related comorbidity.', 'The pharmacologic management of type 2 diabetes has changed dramatically in the  past two decades.

Many patients on this combination therapy do not achieve or  maintain glycemic targets and require the addition of a third antihyperglycemic  agent. Among the options are the sodium glucose cotransporter 2 (SGLT2)  inhibitors, a recently developed class of medications that effectively improve  glycemic control and are associated with reduction in body weight and blood  pressure. This article evaluates a 24-week, randomized, placebo-controlled study  of the SGLT2 inhibitor empagliflozin, added to metformin plus sulfonylurea  regimens. Empagliflozin led to significant reductions in glycated hemoglobin and  fasting plasma glucose, as well as body weight and systolic blood pressure.  Adverse events typically recorded with SGLT2 inhibitors were observed; notably,  genital infections occurred in more patients on empagliflozin than placebo.  Overall, empagliflozin was well tolerated. These results indicate that SGLT2  inhibitors can be successfully added to metformin plus sulfonylurea regimens.  SGLT2 inhibitors are not the only therapeutic option in this clinical situation;  however, based on the secondary effects observed in this and other studies, they  appear to be of particular value for patients who are obese or overweight.', 'BACKGROUND: Empagliflozin is a potent, oral, selective inhibitor of sodium  glucose cotransporter 2 in development for the treatment of type 2 diabetes  mellitus. OBJECTIVE: The goal of these studies was to investigate potential drug-drug  interactions between empagliflozin and gemfibrozil (an organic  anion-transporting polypeptide 1B1 [OATP1B1]/1B3 and organic anion transporter 3  [OAT3] inhibitor), rifampicin (an OATP1B1/1B3 inhibitor), or probenecid (an OAT3  and uridine diphosphate glucuronosyltransferase inhibitor). METHODS: Two open-label, randomized, crossover studies were undertaken in  healthy subjects. In the first study, 18 subjects received the following in 1 of  2 randomized treatment sequences: a single dose of empagliflozin 25 mg alone and  gemfibrozil 600 mg BID for 5 days with a single dose of empagliflozin 25 mg on  the third day. In the second study, 18 subjects received a single dose of  empagliflozin 10 mg, a single dose of empagliflozin 10 mg coadministered with a  single dose of rifampicin 600 mg, and probenecid 500 mg BID for 4 days with a  single dose of empagliflozin 10 mg on the second day in 1 of 6 randomized  treatment sequences. RESULTS: In the gemfibrozil study, 11 subjects were male, mean age was 35.1  years and mean body mass index (BMI) was 23.47 kg/m(2). In the  rifampicin/probenecid study, 10 subjects were male, mean age was 32.7 years and  mean BMI was 23.03 kg/m(2). Exposure to empagliflozin was increased by  coadministration with gemfibrozil (AUC0-∞: geometric mean ratio [GMR], 158.50%  [90% CI, 151.77-165.53]; Cmax: GMR, 115.00% [90% CI, 106.15-124.59]), rifampicin  (AUC0-∞: GMR, 135.20% [90% CI, 129.58-141.06]; Cmax: GMR, 175.14% [90% CI,  160.14-191.56]), and probenecid (AUC0-∞: GMR, 153.47% [90% CI, 146.41-160.88];  Cmax: GMR, 125.60% [90% CI, 113.67-138.78]). All treatments were well tolerated. CONCLUSIONS: Increases in empagliflozin exposure were <2-fold, indicating that  the inhibition of the OATP1B1/1B3, OAT3 transporter, and uridine diphosphate  glucuronosyltransferases did not have a clinically relevant effect on  empagliflozin exposure. No dose adjustments of empagliflozin were necessary when  it was coadministered with gemfibrozil, rifampicin, or probenecid.

120,"The virus that causes FIP, Feline Infectious Peritonitis belongs to what family?","['Feline infectious peritonitis (FIP) is one of the most important infectious  diseases in cats and is caused by feline coronavirus (FCoV). Tissue  culture-adapted type I FCoV shows reduced FIP induction in experimental  infections, which complicates the understanding of FIP pathogenesis caused by  type I FCoV. We previously found that the type I FCoV strain C3663 efficiently  induces FIP in specific-pathogen-free cats through the naturally infectious  route. In this study, we employed a bacterial artificial chromosome-based  reverse genetics system to gain more insights into FIP caused by the C3633  strain. We successfully generated recombinant virus (rC3663) from Fcwf-4 cells  transfected with infectious cDNA that showed growth kinetics similar to those  shown by the parental virus. Next, we constructed a reporter C3663 virus  carrying the nanoluciferase (Nluc) gene to measure viral replication with high  sensitivity. The inhibitory effects of different compounds against rC3663-Nluc  could be measured within 24 h postinfection. Furthermore, we found that A72  cells derived from canine fibroblasts permitted FCoV replication without  apparent cytopathic effects. Thus, our reporter virus is useful for uncovering  the infectivity of type I FCoV in different cell lines, including canine-derived  cells. Surprisingly, we uncovered aberrant viral RNA transcription of rC3663 in  A72 cells. Overall, we succeeded in obtaining infectious cDNA clones derived  from type I FCoV that retained its virulence. Our recombinant FCoVs are powerful  tools for increasing our understanding of the viral life cycle and pathogenesis  of FIP-inducing type I FCoV.IMPORTANCE Feline coronavirus (FCoV) is one of the  most significant coronaviruses, because this virus induces feline infectious  peritonitis (FIP), which is a lethal disease in cats. Tissue culture-adapted  type I FCoV often loses pathogenicity, which complicates research on type I  FCoV-induced feline infectious peritonitis (FIP). Since we previously found that  type I FCoV strain C3663 efficiently induces FIP in specific-pathogen-free cats,  we established a reverse genetics system for the C3663 strain to obtain  recombinant viruses in the present study. By using a reporter C3663 virus, we  were able to examine the inhibitory effect of 68 compounds on C3663 replication  in Fcwf-4 cells and infectivity in a canine-derived cell line. Interestingly,  one canine cell line, A72, permitted FCoV replication but with low efficiency  and aberrant viral gene expression.', 'The feline infectious peritonitis virus (FIPV) is a member of the feline  coronavirus family that causes FIP, which is incurable and fatal in cats.  Cyclosporin A (CsA), an immunosuppressive agent that targets the nuclear factor  pathway of activated T-cells (NF-AT) to bind cellular cyclophilins (CyP),  dose-dependently inhibited FIPV replication in vitro. FK506 (an immunosuppressor  of the pathway that binds cellular FK506-binding protein (FKBP) but not CyP) did  not affect FIPV replication. Neither cell growth nor viability changed in the  presence of either CsA or FK506, and these factors did not affect the NF-AT  pathway in fcwf-4 cells. Therefore, CsA does not seem to exert inhibitory  effects via the NF-AT pathway. In conclusion, CsA inhibited FIPV replication in  vitro and further studies are needed to verify the practical value of CsA as an  anti-FIPV treatment in vivo.', 'Feline infectious peritonitis (FIP), one of the most important lethal infections  of cats, is caused by feline infectious peritonitis virus (FIPV), the  high-virulence biotype of feline coronaviruses (FCoVs). FIPVs are suggested to  emerge from feline enteric coronaviruses (FECVs) by acquiring mutations in  specific genes in the course of persistent infections. Although numerous studies  identified mutations predicted to be responsible for the FECV-FIPV biotype  switch, the presumed roles of specific genetic changes in FIP pathogenesis have  not been confirmed experimentally. Reverse genetics systems established  previously for serotype I and the less common serotype II FCoVs were based on  cell culture-adapted FIPV strains which, however, were shown to be unsuitable  for FIP pathogenesis studies in vivo To date, systems to produce and manipulate  recombinant serotype I field viruses have not been developed, mainly because  these viruses cannot be grown in vitro Here, we report the first reverse  genetics system based on a serotype I FECV field isolate that is suitable to  produce high-titer stocks of recombinant FECVs. We demonstrate that these  recombinant viruses cause productive persistent infections in cats that are  similar to what is observed in natural infections. The system provides an  excellent tool for studying FCoVs that do not grow in standard cell culture  systems and will greatly facilitate studies into the molecular pathogenesis of  FIP. Importantly, the system could also be adapted for studies of other RNA  viruses with large genomes whose production and characterization in vivo are  currently hampered by the lack of in vitro propagation systems.IMPORTANCE The  availability of recombinant serotype I FCoV field isolates that are amenable to  genetic manipulation is key to studying the molecular pathogenesis of FIP,  especially since previous studies using cell culture-adapted FIPVs had proven  unsuccessful. To our knowledge, we report the first serotype I FECV field  isolate-based reverse genetics system that allows the production of high-titer  recombinant virus stocks that can be used for subsequent in vivo studies in  cats. The system represents a milestone in FCoV research. It provides an  essential tool for studying the molecular pathogenesis of FIP and, more  specifically, the functions of specific gene products in causing a fundamentally  different progression of disease following acquisition of specific mutations.  The system developed in this study will also be useful for studying other  coronaviruses or more distantly related RNA viruses with large genomes for which  suitable in vitro culture systems are not available.', 'Feline infectious peritonitis (FIP) belongs to the few animal virus diseases in  which, in the course of a generally harmless persistent infection, a virus  acquires a small number of mutations that fundamentally change its  pathogenicity, invariably resulting in a fatal outcome. The causative agent of  this deadly disease, feline infectious peritonitis virus (FIPV), arises from  feline enteric coronavirus (FECV). The review summarizes our current knowledge  of the genome and proteome of feline coronaviruses (FCoVs), focusing on the  viral surface (spike) protein S and the five accessory proteins. We also review  the current classification of FCoVs into distinct serotypes and biotypes,  cellular receptors of FCoVs and their presumed role in viral virulence, and  discuss other aspects of FIPV-induced pathogenesis. Our current knowledge of  genetic differences between FECVs and FIPVs has been mainly based on comparative  sequence analyses that revealed ""discriminatory"" mutations that are present in  FIPVs but not in FECVs. Most of these mutations result in amino acid  substitutions in the S protein and these may have a critical role in the switch  from FECV to FIPV. In most cases, the precise roles of these mutations in the  molecular pathogenesis of FIP have not been tested experimentally in the natural  host, mainly due to the lack of suitable experimental tools including  genetically engineered virus mutants. We discuss the recent progress in the  development of FCoV reverse genetics systems suitable to generate recombinant  field viruses containing appropriate mutations for in vivo studies.', 'Coronaviruses (CoVs) can cause highly prevalent diseases in humans and animals.  Feline infectious peritonitis virus (FIPV) belongs to the genus  Alphacoronavirus, resulting in a lethal systemic granulomatous disease called  feline infectious peritonitis (FIP), which is one of the most important fatal  infectious diseases of cats worldwide. No specific vaccines or drugs have been  approved to treat FIP. CoV main proteases (M(pro)s) play a pivotal role in viral  transcription and replication, making them an ideal target for drug development.  Here, we report the crystal structure of FIPV M(pro) in complex with dual  inhibitors, a zinc ion and a Michael acceptor. The complex structure elaborates  a unique mechanism of two distinct inhibitors synergizing to inactivate the  protease, providing a structural basis to design novel antivirals and suggesting  the potential to take advantage of zinc as an adjunct therapy against  CoV-associated diseases. IMPORTANCE: Coronaviruses (CoVs) have the largest genome size among all RNA  viruses. CoV infection causes various diseases in humans and animals, including  severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) and Middle East respiratory syndrome  (MERS). No approved specific drugs or vaccinations are available to treat their  infections. Here, we report a novel dual inhibition mechanism targeting CoV main  protease (M(pro)) from feline infectious peritonitis virus (FIPV), which leads  to lethal systemic granulomatous disease in cats. M(pro), conserved across all  CoV genomes, is essential for viral replication and transcription. We  demonstrated that zinc ion and a Michael acceptor-based peptidomimetic inhibitor  synergistically inactivate FIPV M(pro). We also solved the structure of FIPV  M(pro) complexed with two inhibitors, delineating the structural view of a dual  inhibition mechanism. Our study provides new insight into the pharmaceutical  strategy against CoV M(pro) through using zinc as an adjuvant therapy to enhance  the efficacy of an irreversible peptidomimetic inhibitor.', 'Coronaviruses infect animals and humans causing a wide range of diseases. The  diversity of coronaviruses in many mammalian species is contributed by  relatively high mutation and recombination rates during replication. This  dynamic nature of coronaviruses may facilitate cross-species transmission and  shifts in tissue or cell tropism in a host, resulting in substantial change in  virulence. Feline enteric coronavirus (FECV) causes inapparent or mild enteritis  in cats, but a highly fatal disease, called feline infectious peritonitis (FIP),  can arise through mutation of FECV to FIP virus (FIPV). The pathogenesis of FIP  is intimately associated with immune responses and involves depletion of T  cells, features shared by some other coronaviruses like Severe Acute Respiratory  Syndrome Coronavirus. The increasing risks of highly virulent coronavirus  infections in humans or animals call for effective antiviral drugs, but no such  measures are yet available. Previously, we have reported the inhibitors that  target 3C-like protease (3CLpro) with broad-spectrum activity against important  human and animal coronaviruses. Here, we evaluated the therapeutic efficacy of  our 3CLpro inhibitor in laboratory cats with FIP. Experimental FIP is 100% fatal  once certain clinical and laboratory signs become apparent. We found that  antiviral treatment led to full recovery of cats when treatment was started at a  stage of disease that would be otherwise fatal if left untreated. Antiviral  treatment was associated with a rapid improvement in fever, ascites, lymphopenia  and gross signs of illness and cats returned to normal health within 20 days or  less of treatment. Significant reduction in viral titers was also observed in  cats. These results indicate that continuous virus replication is required for  progression of immune-mediated inflammatory disease of FIP. These findings may  provide important insights into devising therapeutic strategies and selection of  antiviral compounds for further development for important coronaviruses in  animals and humans.', 'The feline infectious peritonitis virus (FIPV) is a member of the feline  coronavirus family that causes FIP, which is incurable and fatal in cats.

Up to 10% of FCoV  infections, however, result in the fatal disease feline infectious peritonitis  (FIP). Clinical challenges: Obtaining a definitive diagnosis of FIP based on  non-invasive approaches is difficult. Confirmation of the disease relies on  finding appropriate cytological or histopathological changes in association with  positive immunostaining for FCoV antigen. In FIP cases with effusions, cytology  and immunostaining on effusion samples can be relatively easy to perform;  otherwise obtaining diagnostic samples is more challenging and collection of  biopsies from tissues with gross lesions is necessary. In the absence of a  definitive diagnosis, a high index of suspicion of FIP may be obtained from the  cat's signalment and history, combined with findings on clinical examination and  laboratory test results. If largely consistent with FIP, these can be used as a  basis for discussion with the owner about whether additional, more invasive,  diagnostic tests are warranted. In some cases it may be that euthanasia is  discussed as an alternative to pursuing a definitive diagnosis ante-mortem,  especially if financial limitations exist or where there are concerns over a  cat's ability to tolerate invasive diagnostic procedures. Ideally, the diagnosis  should be confirmed in such patients from samples taken at post-mortem  examination. Global importance: FIP occurs wherever FCoV infection is present in  cats, which equates to most parts of the world. Evidence base: This review  provides a comprehensive overview of how to approach the diagnosis of FIP,  focusing on the tests available to the veterinary practitioner and recently  published evidence supporting their use."", ""Feline coronavirus (FCoV) is an etiological agent that causes a benign enteric  illness and the fatal systemic disease feline infectious peritonitis (FIP).

This regulation is carried  out by spike's major functions: receptor binding and virus-cell membrane fusion.  In this review, we address important aspects in FCoV genetics, replication and  pathogenesis, focusing on the role of S. To better understand this, FCoV S  protein models were constructed, based on the human coronavirus NL63 (HCoV-NL63)  S structure.

However, there  are no reports of EVs from F. alocis. In this study, we purified and  characterized the protein profiles of EVs from F. alocis and investigated their  immunostimulatory activity on human monocytic THP-1 and human oral keratinocyte  HOK-16B cell lines. Highly pure EVs were obtained from F. alocis using density  gradient ultracentrifugation. Nanoparticle tracking analysis and transmission  electron microscopy showed that F. alocis EVs were between 50 and 270\xa0nm in  diameter. Proteome analysis identified 28 proteins, including lipoproteins,  autolysins, F. alocis complement inhibitor (FACIN), transporter-related  proteins, metabolism-related proteins, and ribosomal proteins. Human cytokine  array analysis showed that F. alocis EVs remarkably induced the expression of  CCL1, CCL2, MIP-1, CCL5, CXCL1, CXCL10, ICAM-1, IL-1β, IL-1ra, IL-6, IL-8, MIF,  SerpinE, and TNF-α in THP-1 cells and CXCL1, G-CSF, GM-CSF, IL-6, and IL-8 in  HOK-16B cells. The immunostimulatory activity of F. alocis EVs was similar to  that of the whole bacterial cells.

121,Does the protein mTOR regulate autophagy?,"['Obesity is an independent risk factor for renal dysfunction in patients with  CKDs, including diabetic nephropathy, but the mechanism underlying this  connection remains unclear. Autophagy is an intracellular degradation system  that maintains intracellular homeostasis by removing damaged proteins and  organelles, and autophagy insufficiency is associated with the pathogenesis of  obesity-related diseases. We therefore examined the role of autophagy in  obesity-mediated exacerbation of proteinuria-induced proximal tubular epithelial  cell damage in mice and in human renal biopsy specimens. In nonobese mice, overt  proteinuria, induced by intraperitoneal free fatty acid-albumin overload, led to  mild tubular damage and apoptosis, and activated autophagy in proximal tubules  reabsorbing urinary albumin. In contrast, diet-induced obesity suppressed  proteinuria-induced autophagy and exacerbated proteinuria-induced tubular cell  damage. Proximal tubule-specific autophagy-deficient mice, resulting from an  Atg5 gene deletion, subjected to intraperitoneal free fatty acid-albumin  overload developed severe proteinuria-induced tubular damage, suggesting that  proteinuria-induced autophagy is renoprotective. Mammalian target of rapamycin  (mTOR), a potent suppressor of autophagy, was activated in proximal tubules of  obese mice, and treatment with an mTOR inhibitor ameliorated obesity-mediated  autophagy insufficiency. Furthermore, both mTOR hyperactivation and autophagy  suppression were observed in tubular cells of specimens obtained from obese  patients with proteinuria. Thus, in addition to enhancing the understanding of  obesity-related cell vulnerability in the kidneys, these results suggest that  restoring the renoprotective action of autophagy in proximal tubules may improve  renal outcomes in obese patients.', 'Autophagy is an essential cellular mechanism that degrades cytoplasmic proteins  and organelles to recycle their components. Here we show that autophagy is  required for reprogramming of somatic cells to form induced pluripotent stem  cells (iPSCs). Our data indicate that mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR) is  downregulated by Sox2 at an early stage of iPSC generation and that this  transient downregulation of mTOR is required for reprogramming to take place. In  the absence of Sox2, mTOR remains at a high level and inhibits autophagy.  Mechanistically, Sox2 binds to a repressive region on the mTOR promoter and  recruits the NuRD complex to mediate transcriptional repression. We also  detected enhanced autophagy at the four- to eight-cell stage of embryonic  development, and a similar Sox2 and mTOR-mediated regulatory pathway seems to  operate in this context as well. Thus, our findings reveal Sox2-dependent  temporal regulation of autophagy as a key step in cellular reprogramming  processes.', ""Several lines of evidence suggest that the mechanism underlying drug-induced  neuronal apoptosis is initiated by the increased production of reactive oxygen  species (ROS). 1-Methyl-4-phenyl-1,2,3,6-tetrahydropyridine (MPTP), a  neurotoxin, has been shown to initiate an apoptotic cascade by increasing ROS in  the dopaminergic neurons of the substantia nigra, leading to the morphological  and physiological features associated with Parkinson's disease. Recently, it has  been reported that autophagy, a type of programmed cell death independent of the  apoptotic cascade, also plays a role in neuronal damage. Although autophagy is  negatively regulated by the mammalian target of rapamycin receptor (mTOR), there  is some evidence showing a novel function for the anti-apoptotic protein Bcl-2.  Bcl-2 is proposed to play a role in negatively regulating autophagy by blocking  an essential protein in the signaling pathway, Beclin 1. Nevertheless, it is  unclear whether autophagy is also correlated with apoptotic signaling in  1-methyl-4-phenylpyridinium (MPP(+)) toxicity. Therefore, we hypothesized that  the MPP(+) toxicity generally associated with initiating the apoptotic signaling  cascade also increases an autophagic phenotype in neuronal cells. Using the  SK-N-SH dopaminergic cell lines, we demonstrate that MPP(+) increases the  expression of microtubule-associated protein light chain 3 (LC3-II), an  autophagosome membrane marker and the mTOR signaling pathway, and Beclin 1 while  decreasing the Bcl-2 levels. Moreover, these expressions correlate with a  decreased binding ratio between Bcl-2 and Beclin 1, in effect limiting the  regulation of the downstream autophagic markers, such as LC3-II. Our results  indicate that MPP(+) can induce autophagy in SK-N-SH cells by decreasing the  Bcl-2/Beclin 1 complex."", 'Author information: (1)Freiburg Institute for Advanced Studies (FRIAS); School of Life  Sciences-LifeNet; Freiburg, Germany; ZBSA Center for Biological Systems  Analysis; University of Freiburg; Freiburg, Germany.

The mTOR  pathway is dysregulated in a number of human pathologies including cancer,  diabetes, obesity, autoimmune disorders, neurological disease and aging. Ongoing  clinical trials testing mTOR-targeted treatments number in the hundreds and  underscore its therapeutic potential. To date mTOR inhibitors are clinically  approved to prevent organ rejection, to inhibit restenosis after angioplasty,  and to treat several advanced cancers. In this review we discuss the  continuously evolving field of mTOR pharmacogenomics, as well as highlight the  emerging efforts in identifying diagnostic and prognostic markers, including  miRNAs, in order to assess successful therapeutic responses.', 'Mammalian Target of Rapamycin (mTOR) is a serine/threonine kinase and that forms  two multiprotein complexes known as the mTOR complex 1 (mTORC1) and mTOR complex  2 (mTORC2). mTOR regulates cell growth, proliferation and survival. mTORC1 is  composed of the mTOR catalytic subunit and three associated proteins: raptor,  mLST8/GβL and PRAS40. mTORC2 contains mTOR, rictor, mLST8/GβL, mSin1, and  protor. Here, we discuss mTOR as a promising anti-ischemic agent. It is believed  that mTORC2 lies down-stream of Akt and acts as a direct activator of Akt. The  different functions of mTOR can be explained by the existence of two distinct  mTOR complexes containing unique interacting proteins. The loss of TSC2, which  is upstream of mTOR, activates S6K1, promotes cell growth and survival,  activates mTOR kinase activities, inhibits mTORC1 and mTORC2 via mTOR  inhibitors, and suppresses S6K1 and Akt. Although mTOR signaling pathways are  often activated in human diseases, such as cancer, mTOR signaling pathways are  deactivated in ischemic diseases. From Drosophila to humans, mTOR is necessary  for Ser473 phosphorylation of Akt, and the regulation of Akt-mTOR signaling  pathways may have a potential role in ischemic disease. This review evaluates  the potential functions of mTOR in ischemic diseases. A novel mTOR-interacting  protein deregulates over-expression in ischemic disease, representing a new  mechanism for controlling mTOR signaling pathways and potential therapeutic  strategies for ischemic diseases.', 'BACKGROUND: The mTOR gene regulates cell growth by controlling mRNA translation,  ribosome biogenesis, autophagy, and metabolism. Abnormally increased expression  of mTOR was associated with carcinogenesis, and its functional single nucleotide  polymorphisms (SNPs) may regulate the expression of mTOR and thus contribute to  cancer risk. METHODOLOGY/PRINCIPAL FINDINGS: In a hospital-based case-control study of 1004  prostate cancer (PCa) cases and 1051 cancer-free controls, we genotyped six  potentially functional SNPs of mTOR (rs2536 T>C, rs1883965 G>A, rs1034528 G>C,  rs17036508 T>C, rs3806317 A>G, and rs2295080 T>G) and assessed their  associations with risk of PCa by using logistic regression analysis. CONCLUSIONS/SIGNIFICANCES: In the single-locus analysis, we found a  significantly increased risk of PCa associated with mTOR rs2536 CT/CC and  rs1034528 CG/CC genotypes [adjusted OR\u200a=\u200a1.42 (1.13-1.78), P\u200a=\u200a0.003 and 1.29  (1.07-1.55), P\u200a=\u200a0.007), respectively], compared with their common homozygous  genotypes, whereas mTOR rs2295080 GT/GG genotypes were associated with a  decreased risk of PCa [adjusted OR\u200a=\u200a0.76 (0.64-0.92), P\u200a=\u200a0.003], compared with  wild-type TT genotypes. In the combined analysis of the six SNPs, we found that  individuals carrying two or more adverse genotypes had an increased risk of PCa  [adjusted OR\u200a=\u200a1.24 (1.04-1.47), P\u200a=\u200a0.016], compared with individuals carrying  less than two adverse genotypes. In the multiple dimension reduction analysis,  body mass index (BMI) was the best one-factor model with the highest CVC (100%)  and the lowest prediction error (42.7%) among all seven factors. The model  including an interaction among BMI, rs17036508, and rs2536 was the best  three-factor model with the highest CVC (100%) and the lowest prediction error  of 41.9%. These findings suggested that mTOR SNPs may contribute to the risk of  PCa in Eastern Chinese men, but the effect was weak and needs further validation  by larger population-based studies.', 'Autophagy, a programmed process in which cell contents are delivered to  lysosomes for degradation, appears to have both tumor-suppressive and  tumor-promoting functions; both stimulation and inhibition of autophagy have  been reported to induce cancer cell death, and particular genes and proteins  have been associated both positively and negatively with autophagy. To provide a  basis for incisive analysis of those complexities and ambiguities and to guide  development of new autophagy-targeted treatments for cancer, we have compiled a  comprehensive, curated inventory of autophagy modulators by integrating  information from published siRNA screens, multiple pathway analysis algorithms,  and extensive, manually curated text-mining of the literature. The resulting  inventory includes 739 proteins and 385 chemicals (including drugs, small  molecules, and metabolites). Because autophagy is still at an early stage of  investigation, we provide extensive analysis of our sources of information and  their complex relationships with each other. We conclude with a discussion of  novel strategies that could potentially be used to target autophagy for cancer  therapy.', 'Colorectal cancer is a major contributor of cancer-related mortality. The  mammalian target or rapamycin (mTOR) signaling is frequently hyper-activated in  colorectal cancers, promoting cancer progression and chemo-resistance. In the  current study, we investigated the anti-colorectal cancer effect of a novel mTOR  complex 1 (mTORC1) and mTORC2 dual inhibitor: AZD-2014. In cultured colorectal  cancer cell lines, AZD-2014 significantly inhibited cancer cell growth without  inducing significant cell apoptosis. AZD-2014 blocked activation of both mTORC1  (S6K and S6 phosphorylation) and mTORC2 (Akt Ser 473 phosphorylation), and  activated autophagy in colorectal cancer cells. Meanwhile, autophagy inhibition  by 3-methyaldenine (3-MA) and hydroxychloroquine, as well as by siRNA knocking  down of Beclin-1 or ATG-7, inhibited AZD-2014-induced cytotoxicity, while the  apoptosis inhibitor had no rescue effect. In vivo, AZD-2014 oral administration  significantly inhibited the growth of HT-29 cell xenograft in SCID mice, and the  mice survival was dramatically improved. At the same time, in xenografted tumors  administrated with AZD-2014, the activation of mTORC1 and mTORC2 were largely  inhibited, and autophagic markers were significantly increased. Thus, AZD-2014  inhibits colorectal cancer cell growth both in vivo and in vitro. Our results  suggest that AZD-2014 may be further investigated for colorectal cancer therapy  in clinical trials.', 'The mTOR (mammalian target of rapamycin) protein kinase is an important  regulator of cell growth. Two complexes of mTOR have been identified: complex 1,  consisting of mTOR-Raptor (regulatory associated protein of mTOR)-mLST8 (termed  mTORC1), and complex 2, comprising mTOR-Rictor (rapamycininsensitive companion  of mTOR)-mLST8-Sin1 (termed mTORC2). mTORC1 phosphorylates the p70 ribosomal S6K  (S6 kinase) at its hydrophobic motif (Thr389), whereas mTORC2 phosphorylates PKB  (protein kinase B) at its hydrophobic motif (Ser473). In the present study, we  report that widely expressed isoforms of unstudied proteins termed Protor-1  (protein observed with Rictor-1) and Protor-2 interact with Rictor and are  components of mTORC2. We demonstrate that immunoprecipitation of Protor-1 or  Protor-2 results in the co-immunoprecipitation of other mTORC2 subunits, but not  Raptor, a specific component of mTORC1. We show that detergents such as Triton  X-100 or n-octylglucoside dissociate mTOR and mLST8 from a complex of Protor-1,  Sin1 and Rictor. We also provide evidence that Rictor regulates the expression  of Protor-1, and that Protor-1 is not required for the assembly of other mTORC2  subunits into a complex. Protor-1 is a novel Rictor-binding subunit of mTORC2,  but further work is required to establish its role.']",mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR)  is a major negative regulator of autophagy.
122,What is an acceptable sequence coverage(depth) required for human whole-exome sequencing?,"['PURPOSE: The management of epilepsy in children is particularly challenging when  seizures are resistant to antiepileptic medications, or undergo many changes in  seizure type over time, or have comorbid cognitive, behavioral, or motor  deficits. Despite efforts to classify such epilepsies based on clinical and  electroencephalographic criteria, many children never receive a definitive  etiologic diagnosis. Whole exome sequencing (WES) is proving to be a highly  effective method for identifying de novo variants that cause neurologic  disorders, especially those associated with abnormal brain development. Herein  we explore the utility of WES for identifying candidate causal de novo variants  in a cohort of children with heterogeneous sporadic epilepsies without etiologic  diagnoses. METHODS: We performed WES (mean coverage approximately 40×) on 10 trios  comprised of unaffected parents and a child with sporadic epilepsy characterized  by difficult-to-control seizures and some combination of developmental delay,  epileptic encephalopathy, autistic features, cognitive impairment, or motor  deficits. Sequence processing and variant calling were performed using standard  bioinformatics tools. A custom filtering system was used to prioritize de novo  variants of possible functional significance for validation by Sanger  sequencing. KEY FINDINGS: In 9 of 10 probands, we identified one or more de novo variants  predicted to alter protein function, for a total of 15. Four probands had de  novo mutations in genes previously shown to harbor heterozygous mutations in  patients with severe, early onset epilepsies (two in SCN1A, and one each in  CDKL5 and EEF1A2). In three children, the de novo variants were in genes with  functional roles that are plausibly relevant to epilepsy (KCNH5, CLCN4, and  ARHGEF15). The variant in KCNH5 alters one of the highly conserved arginine  residues of the voltage sensor of the encoded voltage-gated potassium channel.  In vitro analyses using cell-based assays revealed that the CLCN4 mutation  greatly impaired ion transport by the ClC-4 2Cl(-) /H(+) -exchanger and that the  mutation in ARHGEF15 reduced GEF exchange activity of the gene product,  Ephexin5, by about 50%. Of interest, these seven probands all presented with  seizures within the first 6 months of life, and six of these have intractable  seizures. SIGNIFICANCE: The finding that 7 of 10 children carried de novo mutations in  genes of known or plausible clinical significance to neuronal excitability  suggests that WES will be of use for the molecular genetic diagnosis of sporadic  epilepsies in children, especially when seizures are of early onset and  difficult to control.', 'AIMS/HYPOTHESIS: Human complex metabolic traits are in part regulated by genetic  determinants. Here we applied exome sequencing to identify novel associations of  coding polymorphisms at minor allele frequencies (MAFs) >1% with common  metabolic phenotypes. METHODS: The study comprised three stages. We performed medium-depth (8×) whole  exome sequencing in 1,000 cases with type 2 diabetes, BMI >27.5\xa0kg/m(2) and  hypertension and in 1,000 controls (stage 1). We selected 16,192 polymorphisms  nominally associated (p\u2009<\u20090.05) with case-control status, from four selected  annotation categories or from loci reported to associate with metabolic traits.  These variants were genotyped in 15,989 Danes to search for association with 12  metabolic phenotypes (stage 2). In stage 3, polymorphisms showing potential  associations were genotyped in a further 63,896 Europeans. RESULTS: Exome sequencing identified 70,182 polymorphisms with MAF >1%. In stage  2 we identified 51 potential associations with one or more of eight metabolic  phenotypes covered by 45 unique polymorphisms. In meta-analyses of stage 2 and  stage 3 results, we demonstrated robust associations for coding polymorphisms in  CD300LG (fasting HDL-cholesterol: MAF 3.5%, p\u2009=\u20098.5\u2009×\u200910(-14)), COBLL1 (type 2  diabetes: MAF 12.5%, OR 0.88, p\u2009=\u20091.2\u2009×\u200910(-11)) and MACF1 (type 2 diabetes: MAF  23.4%, OR 1.10, p\u2009=\u20098.2\u2009×\u200910(-10)). CONCLUSIONS/INTERPRETATION: We applied exome sequencing as a basis for finding  genetic determinants of metabolic traits and show the existence of low-frequency  and common coding polymorphisms with impact on common metabolic traits. Based on  our study, coding polymorphisms with MAF above 1% do not seem to have  particularly high effect sizes on the measured metabolic traits.', 'Usher syndrome (USH) is a clinically and genetically heterogeneous disorder  characterized by visual and hearing impairments. Clinically, it is subdivided  into three subclasses with nine genes identified so far. In the present study,  we investigated whether the currently available Next Generation Sequencing (NGS)  technologies are already suitable for molecular diagnostics of USH. We analyzed  a total of 12 patients, most of which were negative for previously described  mutations in known USH genes upon primer extension-based microarray genotyping.  We enriched the NGS template either by whole exome capture or by Long-PCR of the  known USH genes. The main NGS sequencing platforms were used: SOLiD for whole  exome sequencing, Illumina (Genome Analyzer II) and Roche 454 (GS FLX) for the  Long-PCR sequencing. Long-PCR targeting was more efficient with up to 94% of USH  gene regions displaying an overall coverage higher than 25×, whereas whole exome  sequencing yielded a similar coverage for only 50% of those regions. Overall  this integrated analysis led to the identification of 11 novel sequence  variations in USH genes (2 homozygous and 9 heterozygous) out of 18 detected.  However, at least two cases were not genetically solved. Our result highlights  the current limitations in the diagnostic use of NGS for USH patients. The limit  for whole exome sequencing is linked to the need of a strong coverage and to the  correct interpretation of sequence variations with a non obvious, pathogenic  role, whereas the targeted approach suffers from the high genetic heterogeneity  of USH that may be also caused by the presence of additional causative genes yet  to be identified.', 'Recent advances in sequencing technologies have revolutionized genetic studies.  Although high-coverage sequencing can uncover most variants present in the  sequenced sample, low-coverage sequencing is appealing for its cost  effectiveness. Here, we present AbCD (arbitrary coverage design) to aid the  design of sequencing-based studies. AbCD is a user-friendly interface providing  pre-estimated effective sample sizes, specific to each minor allele frequency  category, for designs with arbitrary coverage (0.5-30×) and sample size (20-10  000), and for four major ethnic groups (Europeans, Africans, Asians and African  Americans). In addition, we also present two software tools: ShotGun and  DesignPlanner, which were used to generate the estimates behind AbCD. ShotGun is  a flexible short-read simulator for arbitrary user-specified read length and  average depth, allowing cycle-specific sequencing error rates and realistic read  depth distributions. DesignPlanner is a full pipeline that uses ShotGun to  generate sequence data and performs initial SNP discovery, uses our previously  presented linkage disequilibrium-aware method to call genotypes, and, finally,  provides minor allele frequency-specific effective sample sizes. ShotGun plus  DesignPlanner can accommodate effective sample size estimate for any combination  of high-depth and low-depth data (for example, whole-genome low-depth plus  exonic high-depth) or combination of sequence and genotype data [for example,  whole-exome sequencing plus genotyping from existing Genomewide Association  Study (GWAS)].', 'Whole-exome sequencing (Exome-seq) has been successfully applied in several  recent studies. We here sequenced the exomes of 15 pancreatic tumor cell lines  and their matched normal samples. We captured 162,073 exons of 16,954 genes and  sequenced the targeted regions to a mean coverage of 56-fold. This study  identified a total of 1517 somatic mutations and validated 934 mutations by  transcriptome sequencing. We detected recurrent mutations in 56 genes. Among  them, 41 have not been described. The mutation rates varied widely among cell  lines. The diversity of the mutation rates was significantly correlated with the  distinct MLH1 copy-number status. Exome-seq revealed intensive genomic  instability in a cell line with MLH1 homozygous deletion, indicated by a  dramatically elevated rate of somatic substitutions, small insertions/deletions  (indels), as well as indels in microsatellites. Notably, we found that MLH1  expression was decreased by nearly half in cell lines with an allelic loss of  MLH1. While these cell lines were negative in conventional microsatellite  instability assay, they showed a 10.5-fold increase in the rate of somatic  indels, e.g., truncating indels in TP53 and TGFBR2, indicating MLH1  haploinsufficiency in the correction of DNA indel errors. We further analyzed  the exomes of 15 renal cell carcinomas and confirmed MLH1 haploinsufficiency. We  observed a much higher rate of indel mutations in the affected cases and  identified recurrent truncating indels in several cancer genes such as VHL,  PBRM1, and JARID1C. Together, our data suggest that MLH1 hemizygous deletion,  through increasing the rate of indel mutations, could drive the development and  progression of sporadic cancers.', 'We evaluated how variations in sequencing depth and other parameters influence  interpretation of chromatin immunoprecipitation-sequencing (ChIP-seq)  experiments. Using Drosophila melanogaster S2 cells, we generated ChIP-seq data  sets for a site-specific transcription factor (Suppressor of Hairy-wing) and a  histone modification (H3K36me3). We detected a chromatin-state bias: open  chromatin regions yielded higher coverage, which led to false positives if not  corrected. This bias had a greater effect on detection specificity than any  base-composition bias. Paired-end sequencing revealed that single-end data  underestimated ChIP-library complexity at high coverage. Removal of reads  originating at the same base reduced false-positives but had little effect on  detection sensitivity. Even at mappable-genome coverage depth of ∼1 read per  base pair, ∼1% of the narrow peaks detected on a tiling array were missed by  ChIP-seq. Evaluation of widely used ChIP-seq analysis tools suggests that  adjustments or algorithm improvements are required to handle data sets with deep  coverage.', 'MOTIVATION: With the advent of relatively affordable high-throughput  technologies, DNA sequencing of cancers is now common practice in cancer  research projects and will be increasingly used in clinical practice to inform  diagnosis and treatment. Somatic (cancer-only) single nucleotide variants (SNVs)  are the simplest class of mutation, yet their identification in DNA sequencing  data is confounded by germline polymorphisms, tumour heterogeneity and  sequencing and analysis errors. Four recently published algorithms for the  detection of somatic SNV sites in matched cancer-normal sequencing datasets are  VarScan, SomaticSniper, JointSNVMix and Strelka. In this analysis, we apply  these four SNV calling algorithms to cancer-normal Illumina exome sequencing of  a chronic myeloid leukaemia (CML) patient. The candidate SNV sites returned by  each algorithm are filtered to remove likely false positives, then characterized  and compared to investigate the strengths and weaknesses of each SNV calling  algorithm. RESULTS: Comparing the candidate SNV sets returned by VarScan, SomaticSniper,  JointSNVMix2 and Strelka revealed substantial differences with respect to the  number and character of sites returned; the somatic probability scores assigned  to the same sites; their susceptibility to various sources of noise; and their  sensitivities to low-allelic-fraction candidates.

With ongoing discussions on the utility of disclosing or searching for  such variants, it is of crucial importance to obtain unbiased insight in the  prevalence of these incidental or secondary findings, in order to better weigh  potential risks and benefits. Previous studies have reported a broad range of  secondary findings ranging from 1 to 9%, merely attributable to differences in  study design, cohorts tested, sequence technology used and genes analyzed. Here,  we analyzed WES data of 1640 anonymized healthy Dutch individuals to establish  the frequency of medically actionable disease alleles in an outbred population  of European descent. Our study shows that 1 in 38 healthy individuals (2.7%) has  a (likely) pathogenic variant in one of 59 medically actionable dominant disease  genes for which the American College of Medical Genetics and Genomics (ACMG)  recommends disclosure. Additionally, we identified 36 individuals (2.2%) to be a  carrier of a recessive pathogenic disease allele. Whereas these frequencies of  secondary findings are in line with what has been reported in the East-Asian  population, the pathogenic variants are differently distributed across the 59  ACMG genes. Our results contribute to the debate on genetic risk factor  screening in healthy individuals and the discussion whether the potential  benefits of this knowledge and related preventive options, outweigh the risk of  the emotional impact of the test result and possible stigmatization.', 'PURPOSE: Several in silico tools have been shown to have reasonable research  sensitivity and specificity for classifying sequence variants in coding regions.  The recently developed combined annotation-dependent depletion (CADD) method  generates predictive scores for single-nucleotide variants (SNVs) in all areas  of the genome, including noncoding regions. We sought for non-coding variants to  determine the clinical validity of common CADD scores. METHODS: We evaluated 12,391 unique SNVs in 624 patient samples submitted for  germ-line mutation testing in a cancer-related gene panel. Stratifying by  genomic region, we compared the distributions of CADD scores of rare SNVs, SNVs  common in our patient population, and the null distribution of all possible  SNVs. RESULTS: The median CADD scores of intronic and nonsynonymous variants were  significantly different between rare and common SNVs (P < 0.0001). Despite these  different distributions, no individual variants could be identified as plausibly  causative among the rare intronic variants with the highest scores. The  receiver-operating characteristics (ROC) area under the curve (AUC) for  noncoding variants is modest, and the positive predictive value of CADD for  intronic variants in panel testing was found to be 0.088. CONCLUSION: Focused in silico scoring systems with much higher predictive value  will be necessary for clinical genomic applications.Genet Med 18 12, 1269-1275.', 'MOTIVATION: Whole genome and exome sequencing of matched tumor-normal sample  pairs is becoming routine in cancer research. The consequent increased demand  for somatic variant analysis of paired samples requires methods specialized to  model this problem so as to sensitively call variants at any practical level of  tumor impurity. RESULTS: We describe Strelka, a method for somatic SNV and small indel detection  from sequencing data of matched tumor-normal samples. The method uses a novel  Bayesian approach which represents continuous allele frequencies for both tumor  and normal samples, while leveraging the expected genotype structure of the  normal. This is achieved by representing the normal sample as a mixture of  germline variation with noise, and representing the tumor sample as a mixture of  the normal sample with somatic variation. A natural consequence of the model  structure is that sensitivity can be maintained at high tumor impurity without  requiring purity estimates. We demonstrate that the method has superior accuracy  and sensitivity on impure samples compared with approaches based on either  diploid genotype likelihoods or general allele-frequency tests.

123,What are the five traits associated with metabolic syndrome?,"['The metabolic syndrome represents a cluster of closely connected premorbid risk  factors or diseases with visceral obesity type 2 diabetes, hypertension and low  HLD/hypertriglyceridemia as established traits affecting about 20% in the adult  European populations. This syndrome develops on a complex soil with  overnutrition, low physical activity and psychosocial stress. Common  comorbidities are fatty liver, sleep apnoe and endothelial dysfunction with  cardiovascular complications, nephropathy and type 2 diabetes as ""end-stage""  diseases. Thus, a rational diagnostic is needed to elucidate the complex cluster  of diseases as basis for an integrated therapy. There is a clear priority for  life style intervention, however, most diseases of the metabolic syndrome need  medical treatment. Medical treatment of single traits has to take into account  possible pleiotropic or adverse effects on the other traits. This paper presents  the pros and cons of major drug intervention for type 2 diabetes, hypertension,  dyslipidemia and hypercoagulation in the context with the metabolic syndrome.', ""Prevention of the metabolic syndrome and treatment of its main characteristics  are now considered of utmost importance in order to combat the epidemic of type  2 diabetes mellitus and to reduce the increased risk of cardiovascular disease  and all-cause mortality. Insulin resistance/hyperinsulinaemia are consistently  linked with a clustering of multiple clinical and subclinical metabolic risk  factors. It is now widely recognised that obesity (especially abdominal fat  accumulation), hyperglycaemia, dyslipidaemia and hypertension are common  metabolic traits that, concurrently, constitute the distinctive insulin  resistance or metabolic syndrome. Cross-sectional and prospective data provide  an emerging picture of associations of both physical activity habits and  cardiorespiratory fitness with the metabolic syndrome. The metabolic syndrome,  is a disorder that requires aggressive multi-factorial intervention. Recent  treatment guidelines have emphasised the clinical utility of diagnosis and an  important treatment role for 'therapeutic lifestyle change', incorporating  moderate physical activity. Several previous narrative reviews have considered  exercise training as an effective treatment for insulin resistance and other  components of the syndrome. However, the evidence cited has been less consistent  for exercise training effects on several metabolic syndrome variables, unless  combined with appropriate dietary modifications to achieve weight loss. Recently  published randomised controlled trial data concerning the effects of exercise  training on separate metabolic syndrome traits are evaluated within this review.  Novel systematic review and meta-analysis evidence is presented indicating that  supervised, long-term, moderate to moderately vigorous intensity exercise  training, in the absence of therapeutic weight loss, improves the dyslipidaemic  profile by raising high density lipoprotein-cholesterol and lowering  triglycerides in overweight and obese adults with characteristics of the  metabolic syndrome. Lifestyle interventions, including exercise and  dietary-induced weight loss may improve insulin resistance and glucose tolerance  in obesity states and are highly effective in preventing or delaying the onset  of type 2 diabetes in individuals with impaired glucose regulation. Randomised  controlled trial evidence also indicates that exercise training decreases blood  pressure in overweight/obese individuals with high normal blood pressure and  hypertension. These evidence-based findings continue to support recommendations  that supervised or partially supervised exercise training is an important  initial adjunctive step in the treatment of individuals with the metabolic  syndrome. Exercise training should be considered an essential part of  'therapeutic lifestyle change' and may concurrently improve insulin resistance  and the entire cluster of metabolic risk factors."", 'We conducted a two-stage genome-wide association study to identify common  genetic variation altering risk of the metabolic syndrome and related phenotypes  in Indian Asian men, who have a high prevalence of these conditions. In Stage 1,  approximately 317,000 single nucleotide polymorphisms were genotyped in 2700  individuals, from which 1500 SNPs were selected to be genotyped in a further  2300 individuals. Selection for inclusion in Stage 1 was based on four metabolic  syndrome component traits: HDL-cholesterol, plasma glucose and Type 2 diabetes,  abdominal obesity measured by waist to hip ratio, and diastolic blood pressure.  Association was tested with these four traits and a composite metabolic syndrome  phenotype. Four SNPs reaching significance level p<5x10(-7) and with posterior  probability of association >0.8 were found in genes CETP and LPL, associated  with HDL-cholesterol. These associations have already been reported in Indian  Asians and in Europeans. Five additional loci harboured SNPs significant at  p<10(-6) and posterior probability >0.5 for HDL-cholesterol, type 2 diabetes or  diastolic blood pressure. Our results suggest that the primary genetic  determinants of metabolic syndrome are the same in Indian Asians as in other  populations, despite the higher prevalence. Further, we found little evidence of  a common genetic basis for metabolic syndrome traits in our sample of Indian  Asian men.', 'Moderate-to-high levels of physical activity are established as preventive  factors in metabolic syndrome development. However, there is variability in the  phenotypic expression of metabolic syndrome under distinct physical activity  conditions. In the present study we applied a Genotype X Environment interaction  method to examine the presence of GxEE interaction in the phenotypic expression  of metabolic syndrome. A total of 958 subjects, from 294 families of The  Portuguese Healthy Family study, were included in the analysis. Total daily  energy expenditure was assessed using a 3 day physical activity diary. Six  metabolic syndrome related traits, including waist circumference, systolic blood  pressure, glucose, HDL cholesterol, total cholesterol and triglycerides, were  measured and adjusted for age and sex. GxEE examination was performed on SOLAR  4.3.1. All metabolic syndrome indicators were significantly heritable. The GxEE  interaction model fitted the data better than the polygenic model (p<0.001) for  waist circumference, systolic blood pressure, glucose, total cholesterol and  triglycerides. For waist circumference, glucose, total cholesterol and  triglycerides, the significant GxEE interaction was due to rejection of the  variance homogeneity hypothesis. For waist circumference and glucose, GxEE was  also significant by the rejection of the genetic correlation hypothesis. The  results showed that metabolic syndrome traits expression is significantly  influenced by the interaction established between total daily energy expenditure  and genotypes. Physical activity may be considered an environmental variable  that promotes metabolic differences between individuals that are distinctively  active.', 'OBJECTIVE: Metabolic syndrome and the presence of metabolic syndrome components  are risk factors for cardiovascular disease (CVD). However, the association  between personality traits and metabolic syndrome remains controversial, and few  studies have been conducted in East Asian populations. METHODS: We measured personality traits using the Japanese version of the  Eysenck Personality Questionnaire (Revised Short Form) and five metabolic  syndrome components-elevated waist circumference, elevated triglycerides,  reduced high-density lipoprotein cholesterol, elevated blood pressure, and  elevated fasting glucose-in 1322 participants aged 51.1±12.7years old from  Kakegawa city, Japan. Metabolic syndrome score (MS score) was defined as the  number of metabolic syndrome components present, and metabolic syndrome as  having the MS score of 3 or higher. We performed multiple logistic regression  analyses to examine the relationship between personality traits and metabolic  syndrome components and multiple regression analyses to examine the relationship  between personality traits and MS scores adjusted for age, sex, education,  income, smoking status, alcohol use, and family history of CVD and diabetes  mellitus. We also examine the relationship between personality traits and  metabolic syndrome presence by multiple logistic regression analyses. RESULTS: ""Extraversion"" scores were higher in those with metabolic syndrome  components (elevated waist circumference: P=0.001; elevated triglycerides:  P=0.01; elevated blood pressure: P=0.004; elevated fasting glucose: P=0.002).  ""Extraversion"" was associated with the MS score (coefficient=0.12, P=0.0003). No  personality trait was significantly associated with the presence of metabolic  syndrome. CONCLUSIONS: Higher ""extraversion"" scores were related to higher MS scores, but  no personality trait was significantly associated with the presence of metabolic  syndrome.', 'As antioxidants play a protective role in the pathophysiology of diabetes and  cardiovascular diseases, understanding the physiological status of antioxidant  concentration among people at high risk for developing these conditions, such as  Metabolic Syndrome, is of interest. In present study out of 187 first degree  non-diabetic relatives and 192 non-diabetic spouses, 33.1% and 19.7% were found  to have metabolic syndrome respectively. Subjects with metabolic syndrome (≥3  risk factors) had poor antioxidants status as reflected by significantly low  levels of vitamin A, C & E and significantly increased (p<0.01) oxidative stress  as compared to those without metabolic syndrome. At the same time serum insulin  levels and insulin resistance were found to be significantly high (p<0.001) in  metabolic syndrome. A strong positive correlation (r=0.946; p<0.001) between  oxidative stress and insulin resistance was observed in metabolic syndrome. Low  levels of antioxidants and increased oxidative stress with insulin resistance in  metabolic syndrome suggests that besides therapeutic life style changes (TLC) as  suggested in ATP III guidelines inclusion of antioxidant vitamins, fruits and  vegetable could be beneficial to ward off the consequences of metabolic  syndrome.', 'Decrements in cognitive functioning have been linked to the metabolic syndrome  (MetS), a risk factor for cardiovascular disease defined by the presence of  three of the following: elevated blood pressure, increased waist circumference,  elevated blood glucose, elevated triglycerides, and low high-density lipoprotein  cholesterol. We examined the relationship between four measures of executive  functioning (EF) and MetS as diagnosed by National Heart, Lung, and Blood  Institute-American Heart Association criteria. MetS was examined in a rural  population of 395 persons with a mean age of 61.3 years, 71.4% women, 37.0%  Hispanic, 53.7% White non-Hispanic. There was a 61.0% prevalence of MetS. We  derived a factor score from the four executive function measures which was used  to compare those with and without the syndrome, as well as any additive effects  of components of the syndrome. Those with MetS exhibited significantly poorer  performance than those without the syndrome. However, there was no additive  effect, having more components of the syndrome was not related to lower  performance. The presence of MetS was associated with poorer EF in this rural  cohort of community dwelling volunteers.', 'OBJECTIVE: Dietary habits have been associated with the prevalence of the  metabolic syndrome and limited data are available in this field for individuals  with impaired glucose tolerance. This study focused on the association between  major dietary patterns and prevalence of the metabolic syndrome in individuals  with impaired glucose tolerance. METHODS: This cross-sectional study was done in 425 subjects 35 to 55 y of age.  Dietary data were collected using a food-frequency questionnaire. Blood  pressure, waist circumference, glucose, triacylglycerols, and high-density  lipoprotein cholesterol were measured and metabolic syndrome was defined based  on Adult Treatment Panel III guidelines. RESULTS: Five major dietary patterns were found: a western pattern (high in  sweets, butter, soda, mayonnaise, sugar, cookies, tail of a lamb, hydrogenated  fat, and eggs), a prudent pattern (high in fish, peas, honey, nuts, juice, dry  fruits, vegetable oil, liver and organic meat, and coconuts and low in  hydrogenated fat and non-leafy vegetables), a vegetarian pattern (high in  potatoes, legumes, fruits rich in vitamin C, rice, green leafy vegetables, and  fruits rich in vitamin A), a high-fat dairy pattern (high in high-fat yogurt and  high-fat milk and low in low-fat yogurt, peas, and bread), and a chicken and  plant pattern (high in chicken, fruits rich in vitamin A, green leafy  vegetables, and mayonnaise and low in beef, liver, and organic meat). After  adjusting for confounding variables, the western pattern was associated with  greater odds of having increased triacylglycerol (odds ratio 1.76, 95%  confidence interval 1.01-3.07) and blood pressure (odds ratio 2.62, 95%  confidence interval 1.32-5.23). The prudent pattern was positively associated  with a prevalence of low high-density lipoprotein cholesterol levels (odds ratio  0.55, 95% confidence interval 0.31-0.96). The vegetarian dietary pattern was  inversely associated with a risk of an abnormal fasting blood glucose level  (odds ratio 2.26, 95% confidence interval 1.25-4.06). CONCLUSION: Major dietary patterns were significantly associated with the risk  of metabolic syndrome.', 'The metabolic syndrome is a constellation of risk factors including glucose  dysregulation, central obesity, dyslipidemia, and hypertension. There are  multiple definitions that have been described by various health organizations.  However, we do know that insulin resistance plays a major role as the underlying  cause for the development and potentiation of the metabolic syndrome. At  present, it is unclear if the diagnosis of metabolic syndrome is greater than  the sum of its parts. However, the presence of more than one of the associated  risk factors should indicate that a patient is at increased risk for developing  diabetes, cardiovascular disease and death. Thus, the primary care physician  should aggressively treat the metabolic risk factors in their patients to  prevent the onset and progression to more severe disease.', 'BACKGROUND AND AIMS: Metabolic syndrome is the concurrent presentation of  multiple cardiovascular risk factors, including obesity, insulin resistance,  hyperglycemia, dyslipidemia and hypertension. It has been suggested that some of  these risk factors can have detrimental effects on the skeletal muscle while  others can be a direct result of skeletal muscle abnormalities, showing a  two-way directionality in the pathogenesis of the condition. This review aims to  explore this bidirectional correlation by discussing the impact of metabolic  syndrome on skeletal muscle tissue in general and will also discuss ways in  which skeletal muscle alterations may contribute to the pathogenesis of  metabolic syndrome. METHODS: Literature searches were conducted with key words (e.g. metabolic  syndrome, skeletal muscle, hyperglycemia) using PubMed, EBSCOhost, Science  Direct and Google Scholar. All article types were included in the search. RESULTS: The pathological mechanisms associated with metabolic syndrome, such as  hyperglycemia and inflammation, have been associated with changes in skeletal  muscle fiber composition, metabolism, insulin sensitivity, mitochondrial  function, and strength. Additionally, some skeletal muscle alterations,  particularly mitochondrial dysfunction and insulin resistance, are suggested to  contribute to the development of metabolic syndrome. For example, the suggested  underlying mechanisms of sarcopenia development are also contributors to  metabolic syndrome pathogenesis. CONCLUSION: Whilst numerous studies have identified a relationship between  metabolic syndrome and skeletal muscle abnormalities, further investigation into  the underlying mechanisms is needed to elucidate the best prevention and  management strategies for these conditions.']","Metabolic syndrome is the concurrent presentation of multiple cardiovascular risk factors, including obesity, insulin resistance, hyperglycemia, dyslipidemia and hypertension."
124,Which substances are dangerous to g6PD deficient individuals?,"['BACKGROUND: G6PD deficiency is the most common enzymopathy of red blood cells.  The clinical symptoms of favism are jaundice, hematuria and haemolytic anaemia  that seem to affect liver and kidney in long term. Thus we evaluate kidney and  liver function of favism patients in an endemic area of the disease with a high  rate of fava beans cultivation. METHODS: This study was performed on favism patients and healthy controls  referring to Iranshahr central hospital. Liver and kidney function tests were  performed. RESULTS: The results showed a statistically significant difference between these  two groups (p <0.05) for liver function tests, (AST, ALT and ALP), but not for  renal tests (BUN and creatinine) (p >0.05). CONCLUSION: Due to abnormalities were seen in the liver function tests of these  patients, we suggest that these tests be regularly performed for favism patients  who are constantly exposed to oxidant agents.', 'BACKGROUND: Glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase (G6PD) is important in the control  of oxidant stress in erythrocytes, the host cells for Plasmodium falciparum.  Mutations in this enzyme produce X-linked deficiency states associated with  protection against malaria, notably in Africa where the A- form of G6PD  deficiency is widespread. Some reports have proposed that heterozygous females  with mosaic populations of normal and deficient erythrocytes (due to random X  chromosome inactivation) have malaria resistance similar to or greater than  hemizygous males with populations of uniformly deficient erythrocytes. These  proposals are paradoxical, and they are not consistent with currently  hypothesized mechanisms of protection. METHODS AND FINDINGS: We conducted large case-control studies of the A- form of  G6PD deficiency in cases of severe or uncomplicated malaria among two ethnic  populations of rural Mali, West Africa, where malaria is hyperendemic. Our  results indicate that the uniform state of G6PD deficiency in hemizygous male  children conferred significant protection against severe, life-threatening  malaria, and that it may have likewise protected homozygous female children. No  such protection was evident from the mosaic state of G6PD deficiency in  heterozygous females. We also found no significant differences in the parasite  densities of males and females with differences in G6PD status. Pooled odds  ratios from meta-analysis of our data and data from a previous study confirmed  highly significant protection against severe malaria in hemizygous males but not  in heterozygous females. Among the different forms of severe malaria, protection  was principally evident against cerebral malaria, the most frequent form of  life-threatening malaria in these studies. CONCLUSIONS: The A- form of G6PD deficiency in Africa is under strong natural  selection from the preferential protection it provides to hemizygous males  against life-threatening malaria. Little or no such protection is present among  heterozygous females. Although these conclusions are consistent with data from  at least one previous study, they have not heretofore been realized to our  knowledge, and they therefore give fresh perspectives on malaria protection by  G6PD deficiency as an X-linked trait.', 'Glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase (G6PD) deficiency is one of the most common  human enzyme deficiencies in the world. It is particularly common in populations  living in malaria-endemic areas, affecting more than 400 million people  worldwide. This present study was conducted with the aim of determining the  prevalence of G6PD deficiency among children visiting the Emergency Paediatric  Unit of Usmanu Danfodiyo University Teaching Hospital for pediatric-related  care. The study included 118 children, made up of 77 (65.3%) males and 41  (34.7%) females aged ≤5 years with mean age of 3.26 ± 1.90 years. Randox G6PD  quantitative in vitro test screening was used for the diagnosis of G6PD  deficiency. Of the 118 children tested, 17 (14.4%) were G6PD-deficient.  Prevalence of G6PD deficiency was concentrated predominantly among male children  (22.1%). Male sex was significantly correlated with G6PD deficiency among the  children studied (r = 7.85, P = 0.01). The highest prevalence occurred among  children in the 2- to 5-year age-group. Of the 17 G6PD-deficient children,  twelve (70.2%) were moderately deficient, while five (29.4%) were severely  deficient. Blood film from G6PD-deficient children indicated the following  morphological changes; Heinz bodies, schistocytes, target cells, nucleated red  cells, spherocytes, and polychromasia. This present study has shown a high  prevalence of G6PD deficiency among children residing in Sokoto in the  northwestern geopolitical zone of Nigeria. The study indicated a male sex bias  in the prevalence of G6PD deficiency among the children studied. There is a need  for the routine screening of children for G6PD deficiency in our environment, to  allow for evidence-based management of these children and to ensure the  avoidance of food, drugs, and infective agents that can potentially predispose  these children to oxidative stress as well as diseases that deplete  micronutrients that protect against oxidative stress. There is need to build  capacity in our setting among pediatricians to ensure the effective management  of children with G6PD deficiency.', 'BACKGROUND: G6PD deficiency is common in malaria endemic regions and is  estimated to affect more than 400 million people worldwide. Treatment of malaria  patients with the anti-malarial drug primaquine or other 8-aminoquinolines may  be associated with potential haemolytic anaemia. The aim of the present study  was to investigate the prevalence of G6PD variants in Thai population who  resided in malaria endemic areas (western, northern, north-eastern, southern,  eastern and central regions) of Thailand, as well as the Burmese population who  resided in areas along the Thai-Myanmar border. METHODS: The ten common G6PD variants were investigated in dried blood spot  samples collected from 317 Thai (84 males, 233 females) and 183 Burmese (11  males, 172 females) populations residing in malaria endemic areas of Thailand  using PCR-RFLP method. RESULTS: Four and seven G6PD variants were observed in samples collected from  Burmese and Thai population, with prevalence of 6.6% (21/317) and 14.2%  (26/183), respectively. Almost all (96.2%) of G6PD mutation samples collected  from Burmese population carried G6PD Mahidol variant; only one sample (3.8%)  carried G6PD Kaiping variant. For the Thai population, G6PD Mahidol (8/21:  38.1%) was the most common variant detected, followed by G6PD Viangchan (4/21:  19.0%), G6PD Chinese 4 (3/21: 14.3%), G6PD Canton (2/21: 9.5%), G6PD Union  (2/21: 9.5%), G6PD Kaiping (1/21: 4.8%), and G6PD Gaohe (1/21: 4.8%). No G6PD  Chinese 3, Chinese 5 and Coimbra variants were found. With this limited sample  size, there appeared to be variation in G6PD mutation variants in samples  obtained from Thai population in different regions particularly in the western  region. CONCLUSIONS: Results indicate difference in the prevalence and distribution of  G6PD gene variants among the Thai and Burmese populations in different malaria  endemic areas. Dosage regimen of primaquine for treatment of both Plasmodium  falciparum and Plasmodium vivax malaria may need to be optimized, based on  endemic areas with supporting data on G6PD variants. Larger sample size from  different malaria endemic is required to obtain accurate genetic mapping of G6PD  variants in Burmese and Thai population residing in malaria endemic areas of  Thailand.', 'We screened 423 patients referred to our laboratory after hemolysis triggered by  fava beans ingestion, neonatal jaundice or drug hemolysis. Others were  asymptomatic but belonged to a family with a history of G6PD deficiency. The  determination of enzymatic activity using spectrophotometric method, revealed  293 deficient (143 males and 150 females). The molecular analysis was performed  by a combination of PCR-RFLP and DNA sequencing to characterize the mutations  causing G6PD deficiency. 14 different genotypes have been identified : G6PD A(-)  (376A>G;202G>A) (46.07%) and G6PD Med (33.10%) were the most common variants  followed by G6PD Santamaria (5.80%), G6PD Kaiping (3.75%), the association  [c.1311T and IVS11 93c] (3.75%), G6PD Chatham (2.04%), G6PD Aures (1.70%), G6PD  A(-) Betica (0.68%), the association [ 376G;c.1311T;IVS11 93c] (0.68%), G6PD  Malaga, G6PD Canton and G6PD Abeno respectively (0.34%). Two novel missense  mutations were identified (c.920A>C: p.307Gln>Pro and c.968T>C: p.323 Leu>Pro).  We designated these two class III variants as G6PD Tunis and G6PD Nefza. A  mechanism which could account for the defective activity is discussed.', 'BACKGROUND: Glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase deficiency (G6PDd) has been shown  to protect against malaria infection and severe manifestations in African and  Asia, but there is a scarcity of studies in the Americas. This study aimed to  study the prevalence of G6PDd and its association with malaria occurrence in the  Brazilian Amazon. METHODS: A cross-sectional study was conducted in the male population to  estimate the prevalence of G6PDd and malaria infection. G6PD deficient samples  were genotyped to identify the deficient variant. Number of previous malaria  episodes and need for blood transfusion during malaria episodes were recorded by  applying a standardized questionary. RESULTS: From a sample of 1478 male individuals, 66 were detected as G6PD  deficient, resulting in a prevalence of of 4.5% (95% CI = 3.44-5.56%). Fifty six  G6PD deficient individuals (3.8%; 95% CI = 2.82-4.77) presented the G6PD  A-variant mutation, while 10 individuals (0.7%; 95% CI = 0.42-0.97) severely  deficient were genotyped as carriers of the G6PD Mediterranean variant. After  adjusting for age, G6PD deficient individuals were less likely to report the  occurrence of malaria episodes, and the protective effect was related to the  enzyme activity, with carriers of the GG6PD A-variant presenting a 88% reduction  (AOR: 0.119; 95% CI = 0.057-0.252; p < 0.001) and carriers of the Meditarrenean  variant presenting 99% lower risk (AOR: 0.010; 95% CI = 0.002-0.252; p < 0.001)  when compared to non-deficient individuals. On the other hand, G6PD deficient  subjects reported higher need of transfusion during malaria episodes (p <  0.001). CONCLUSION: G6PD enzyme activity was directly related to susceptibility to  malaria in the Brazilian Amazon, where P. vivax predominates. Severe G6PDd was  associated with considerable higher risk of malaria-related transfusions.', ""The aims of this study were to determine the prevalence of glucose-6-phosphate  dehydrogenase (G6PD) deficiency in the United Arab Emirates (UAE), to describe  the different mutations in the population, to determine its prevalence, and to  study inheritance patterns in families of G6PD-deficient individuals. All  infants born at Tawam Hospital, Al-Ain, UAE from January 1994 to September 1996  were screened at birth for their G6PD status. In addition, those attending  well-baby clinics during the period were also screened for the disorder.  Families of 40 known G6PD-deficient individuals, selected randomly from the  records of three hospitals in the country, were assessed for G6PD deficiency.  Where appropriate, this was followed by definition of G6PD mutations. Of 8198  infants, 746 (9.1%), comprising 15% of males and 5% of females tested, were  found to be G6PD deficient. A total of 27 families were further assessed: of  these, all but one family had the nt563 Mediterranean mutation. In one family,  two individuals had the nt202 African mutation. The high manifestation of G6PD  deficiency in women may be due to the preferential expression of the  G6PD-deficient gene and X-inactivation of the normal gene, and/or to the  presence of an 'enhancer' gene that makes the expression of the G6PD deficiency  more likely. The high level of consanguinity which, theoretically, should result  in a high proportion of homozygotes and consequently a higher proportion of  females with the deficiency, was not found to be a significant factor."", 'Per cent stimulation of GR activity by FAD in vitro and PNP oxidase activity  were measured in G6PD deficiency, heterozygous beta-thalassaemia and controls.  It is confirmed that, in contrast to the high stimulation of GR by FAD commonly  found in in thalassaemia indicating red-cell deficiency of FAD, and shown here  to be greater in the Italian subjects, GR is usually saturated with FAD in G6PD  deficiency, leading to high in vitro activity. Unexpectedly, on the other hand,  low FMN-dependent PNP oxidase activity due to red-cell deficiency of FMN,  confirmed by response to oral riboflavin, was found in the majority of subjects  with G6PD deficiency, similar to that found in heterozygous beta-thalassaemia.  Whereas this is explained in thalassaemia by an inherited slow red-cell  metabolism of riboflavin to FMN, it is suggested that in G6PD deficiency an  increased rate of red-cell metabolism of FMN to FAD leads to the low FMN and  high FAD. When G6PD deficiency occurs with heterozygous beta-thalassaemia, GR is  usually saturated with FAD as in G6PD deficiency alone, unless there is an  inherited, very slow red-cell metabolism of riboflavin to FMN. The part played  by GR in haemolytic crises in G6PD deficiency is discussed.', 'After having described in detail the pathophysiology, symptomatology,  X-chromosomal inheritance and some laboratory methods in detecting  G-6-PD-deficiency by demonstrating a case of favism (Schulz et al. 1977), the  authors now discuss the particularities of the enzyme deficiency in the newborn.  These are complicated by additional physiological and transient deficiency of  the enzymes catalase, NAD-diaphorase, glutathione peroxidase, and glucuronyl  transferase. Several chemical substances, acidosis, hypoxia, hypoglycemia, and  immaturity may cause a severe hyperbilirubinemia in G-6-PD-deficient newborns.  The development of a kern-icterus in these cases may be prevented by early  exchange transfusion. From clinical findings and some observations in different  regions of Greece an additional factor influencing the liver function has been  postulated which favors the development of hyperbilirubinemias in  G-6-PD-deficient newborns. The nature of this possible factor is discussed. The  authors emphasize the necessity of screening for G-6-PD-deficiency during  pregnancy in families of mediterranian descent.', 'Glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase (G6PD) deficiency, a common X-linked  enzymopathy can lead to severe hyperbilirubinemia, acute bilirubin  encephalopathy and kernicterus in the United States. Neonatal testing for G6PD  deficiency is not yet routine and the American Academy of Pediatrics recommends  testing only in jaundiced newborns who are receiving phototherapy whose family  history, ethnicity, or geographic origin suggest risk for the condition, or for  infants whose response to phototherapy is poor. Screening tests for G6PD  deficiency are available, are suitable for use in newborns and have been used in  birth hospitals. However, US birth hospitals experience is limited and no  national consensus has emerged regarding the need for newborn G6PD testing, its  effectiveness or the best approach. Our review of current state of G6PD  deficiency screening highlights research gaps and informs specific operational  challenges to implement universal newborn G6PD testing concurrent to bilirubin  screening in the United States.']","Antimalarial drugs (primaquine, pamaquine, chloriquine), fava beans, sulfonamides, some antibiotics( nalidixic acid, nitrofurantoin, isoniazid, dapsone, and furazolidone) and henna"
125,What is the mode of inheritance of Romano Ward long QT syndrome?,"['Loss of consciousness in childhood may be due to cardiovascular causes, and the  Long Q-T syndromes can present with seizures. The Romano-Ward syndrome is of  autosomal dominant inheritance, and the Jervell and Lange-Nielson syndrome, with  associated deafness, of autosomal recessive inheritance. The diagnosis is often  delayed, but a careful history can avoid this. The syndromes can appear to be  due to an imbalance in the sympathetic nerve to the ventricular myocardium, and  precipitating causes such as stress suggest a CNS influence on this. The  electrocardiogram can confirm the prolonged Q-T interval, but this is not always  present, at least without an exercise test. Treatment with beta-blockers is  often successful. If a wrong diagnosis of epilepsy is made a chance may be  missed of avoiding sudden death, quite apart from all the medical, and social  consequences that can result from such a diagnosis.', 'The inherited long QT syndrome (LQTS), characterized by a prolonged QT interval  in the electrocardiogram and cardiac arrhythmia, is caused by mutations in at  least four different genes, three of which have been identified and encode  cardiac ion channels. The most common form of LQTS is due to mutations in the  potassium channel gene KVLQT1, but their effects on associated currents are  still unknown. Different mutations in KVLQT1 cause the dominant Romano-Ward (RW)  syndrome and the recessive Jervell and Lange-Nielsen (JLN) syndrome, which, in  addition to cardiac abnormalities, includes congenital deafness. Co-expression  of KvLQT1 with the IsK protein elicits slowly activating potassium currents  resembling the cardiac Iks current. We now show that IsK not only changes the  kinetics of KvLQT1 currents, but also its ion selectivity. Several mutations  found in RW, including a novel mutation (D222N) in the putative channel pore,  abolish channel activity and reduce the activity of wild-type KvLQT1 by a  dominant-negative mechanism. By contrast, a JLN mutation truncating the  carboxyterminus of the KvLQT1 channel protein abolishes channel function without  having a dominant-negative effect. This fully explains the different patterns of  inheritance. Further, we identified a novel splice variant of the KVLQT1 gene,  but could not achieve functional expression of this nor of a previously  described heart-specific isoform.', 'Recurrent syncope, malignant ventricular arrhythmias, and sudden death are  complications of the long QT syndrome (LQTS). Two well-known syndromes with long  QT intervals are known. The Jervell and Lange-Nielsen syndrome (JLNS) is  characterized by prolongation of the QT interval, deafness, and  autosomal-recessive inheritance, and the Romano-Ward syndrome is characterized  by a prolonged QT interval, autosomal-dominant inheritance, and no deafness. In  the present study assessment was performed of the diagnostic importance of the  ventricular derepolarization parameters, clinical features, and prevalence of  JLNS among 132 children with congenital hearing loss (CHL). In the CHL group the  mean QT, QTc, JT, and JTc intervals and the dispersion values (QT-d, JT-d,  QTc-d, and JTc-d) were significantly longer than those of control subjects (n =  96) (P < 0.05). Patients with CHL and JLNS (n = 5) had significantly longer mean  values of QT, QTc, JT, and JTc intervals and dispersion values than those of CHL  without JLNS (n = 127) and control subjects (P < 0.05). The results suggest that  assessment of ventricular derepolarization parameters in children with CHL will  be helpful in the early detection of JLNS because infants with CHL cannot  accurately describe the symptoms of syncope.', 'A family with the Romano-Ward syndrome is presented. This family showed typical  features of this syndrome with QT prolongation, torsades de pointes ventricular  tachycardia, sudden death and an autosomal dominant inheritance pattern. The  index case presented with an exacerbation of torsades de pointes ventricular  tachycardia from diuretic induced hypokalaemia, and responded to diuretic  withdrawal and beta blocker therapy.', 'Romano-Ward syndrome is a subtype of prolonged QT syndrome with autosomal  dominant inheritance. Stress-induced syncope and sudden death are secondary to  ventricular tachydysrhythmias. A case report of Romano-Ward syndrome  complicating pregnancy is presented. Successful therapy with propranolol for  life-threatening dysrhythmias was achieved. An excellent neonatal outcome  occurred.', 'Recent discoveries of genes involved in long-QT syndrome (LQTS) have led to  extensive progress in understanding the molecular basis for this disorder of  syncope and sudden cardiac death secondary to ventricular arrhythmias. The  emerging unifying theme is that all genes identified to date encode either  structural or regulatory subunits for ion channels involved in cardiac  repolarization. Defects have been identified in the KCNQ1, HERG, and KCNE1  genes, whose proteins form the K+ channels for the slowly and rapidly inwardly  rectifying K+ currents IKs and IKr. Depending on their location and copy number,  mutations of KCNQ1 and KCNE1 can cause either autosomal dominant Romano-Ward  syndrome or autosomal recessive Jervell and Lange-Nielsen syndrome. The cardiac  sodium channel gene, SCN5A, is also mutated in some Romano-Ward cases to produce  defects in INa, the cardiac inward Na+ current. The fact that multiple genes are  involved and that most LQTS mutations are ""private"" or ""family-specific""  complicates molecular diagnosis of LQTS which, currently, is limited to a small  number of research laboratories. In future, genotypic determination of LQTS  patients and their family members will hopefully lead to improved gene-specific  prognostic determinations and therapeutic interventions.', 'BACKGROUND: Long-QT Syndrome (LQTS) is a cardiovascular disorder characterized  by prolongation of the QT interval on ECG and presence of syncope, seizures, and  sudden death. Five genes have been implicated in Romano-Ward syndrome, the  autosomal dominant form of LQTS: KVLQT1, HERG, SCN5A, KCNE1, and KCNE2.  Mutations in KVLQT1 and KCNE1 also cause the Jervell and Lange-Nielsen syndrome,  a form of LQTS associated with deafness, a phenotypic abnormality inherited in  an autosomal recessive fashion. METHODS AND RESULTS: We used mutational analyses to screen a pool of 262  unrelated individuals with LQTS for mutations in the 5 defined genes. We  identified 134 mutations in addition to the 43 that we previously reported.  Eighty of the mutations were novel. The total number of mutations in this  population is now 177 (68% of individuals). CONCLUSIONS: KVLQT1 (42%) and HERG (45%) accounted for 87% of identified  mutations, and SCN5A (8%), KCNE1 (3%), and KCNE2 (2%) accounted for the other  13%. Missense mutations were most common (72%), followed by frameshift mutations  (10%), in-frame deletions, and nonsense and splice-site mutations (5% to 7%  each). Most mutations resided in intracellular (52%) and transmembrane (30%)  domains; 12% were found in pore and 6% in extracellular segments. In most cases  (78%), a mutation was found in a single family or an individual.', 'Two forms of the inherited long QT syndrome have been known for many years: the  autosomal recessive Jervell and Lange-Nielsen form and the autosomal dominant  Romano-Ward form. A gene marker at the 11p 15.5 locus has been identified for  some, but not all, families with the autosomal dominant form, but as yet the  gene has not been identified. It is apparent that mutations of at least four  genes, and possibly more, can cause the syndrome. The molecular biology of the  syndrome is not yet clarified, but abnormalities of ion channel function are  likely, particularly the potassium delayed rectifier current. Proposals for the  pathophysiology include an abnormality of a G protein which controls ion channel  and adrenergic pathway function, as well as a disturbance of the sympathetic  nervous system. The identification of the abnormal gene(s) and the gene products  will provide precise information on the molecular physiology of the syndrome.', 'OBJECTIVE: Hereditary long QT syndrome (LQTS) is a genetically heterogeneous  disease characterized by prolonged QT intervals and an increased risk for  ventricular arrhythmias and sudden cardiac death. Mutations in the voltage-gated  potassium channel subunit KCNQ1 induce the most common form of LQTS. KCNQ1 is  associated with two different entities of LQTS, the autosomal-dominant  Romano-Ward syndrome (RWS), and the autosomal-recessive Jervell and  Lange-Nielsen syndrome (JLNS) characterized by bilateral deafness in addition to  cardiac arrhythmias. In this study, we investigate and discuss dominant-negative  I(Ks) current reduction by a KCNQ1 deletion mutation identified in a RWS family. METHODS: Single-strand conformation polymorphism analysis and direct sequencing  were used to screen LQTS genes for mutations. Mutant KCNQ1 channels were  heterologously expressed in Xenopus oocytes, and potassium currents were  recorded using the two-microelectrode voltage clamp technique. RESULTS: A heterozygous deletion of three nucleotides (CTT) identified in the  KCNQ1 gene caused the loss of a single phenylalanine residue at position 339  (KCNQ1-deltaF339). Electrophysiological measurements in the presence and absence  of the regulatory beta-subunit KCNE1 revealed that mutant and wild type forms of  an N-terminal truncated KCNQ1 subunit (isoform 2) caused much stronger  dominant-negative current reduction than the mutant form of the full-length  KCNQ1 subunit (isoform 1). CONCLUSION: This study highlights the functional relevance of the truncated  KCNQ1 splice variant (isoform 2) in establishment and mode of inheritance in  long QT syndrome. In the RWS family presented here, the autosomal-dominant trait  is caused by multiple dominant-negative effects provoked by heteromultimeric  channels formed by wild type and mutant KCNQ1-isoforms in combination with  KCNE1.', 'BACKGROUND: Long-QT (LQT) syndrome is a cardiac disorder that causes syncope,  seizures, and sudden death from ventricular arrhythmias, specifically torsade de  pointes. Both autosomal dominant LQT (Romano-Ward syndrome) and autosomal  recessive LQT (Jervell and Lange-Nielsen syndrome, JLNS) have been reported.  Heterozygous mutations in 3 potassium channel genes, KVLQT1, KCNE1 (minK), and  HERG, and the cardiac sodium channel gene SCN5A cause autosomal dominant LQT.  Autosomal recessive LQT, which is associated with deafness, has been found to  occur with homozygous mutations in KVLQT1 and KCNE1 in JLNS families in which  QTc prolongation was inherited as a dominant trait. METHODS AND RESULTS: An Amish family with clinical evidence of JLNS was analyzed  for mutations by use of single-strand conformation polymorphism and DNA  sequencing analyses for mutations in all known LQT genes. A novel homozygous  2-bp deletion in the S2 transmembrane segment of KVLQT1 was identified in  affected members of this Amish family in which both QTc prolongation and  deafness were inherited as recessive traits. This deletion represents a new  JLNS-associated mutation in KVLQT1 and has deleterious effects on the KVLQT1  potassium channel, causing a frameshift and the truncation of the KVLQT1  protein. In contrast to previous reports in which LQT was inherited as a clear  dominant trait, 2 parents in the JLNS family described here have normal QTc  intervals (0.43 and 0.44 seconds, respectively). CONCLUSIONS: A novel homozygous KVLQT1 mutation causes JLNS in an Amish family  with deafness that is inherited as an autosomal recessive trait.']",The Romano Ward long QT syndrome (LQTS) has an autosomal dominant mode of inheritance.
126,Is Hirschsprung disease one of the characteristics of the Mowat-Wilson syndrome?,"[""Mowat-Wilson syndrome (MWS) is a rare genetic condition where variable and  multiple congenital anomalies including Hirschsprung's disease, intellectual  disability, and prominent facial features are present. At molecular level, MWS  is characterized by many different described mutations in the zinc finger E-box  protein 2 (ZEB2) gene, ultimately leading to loss of gene function. This report  is the first to describe the association of MWS with two different asynchronous  malignant brain tumors (medulloblastoma and glioblastoma) occurring in a child."", 'Mowat-Wilson syndrome (MWS) is an autosomal dominant intellectual disability  syndrome characterised by unique facial features and congenital anomalies such  as Hirschsprung disease, congenital heart defects, corpus callosum agenesis and  urinary tract anomalies. Some cases also present epilepsy, growth retardation  and microcephaly. The syndrome is caused by mutations or deletions of the ZEB2  gene at chromosome 2q22-q23. MWS was first described in 1998 and until now  approximately 180 cases have been reported worldwide. We report the first three  molecularly confirmed Danish cases with MWS.', 'Hypospadias, when the urethra opens on the ventral side of the penis, is a  common malformation seen in about 3 per 1,000 male births. It is a complex  disorder associated with genetic and environmental factors and can be part of  genetic syndromes. Mowat-Wilson syndrome (MWS) is a multiple congenital anomaly  syndrome characterized by a distinct facial phenotype, Hirschsprung disease,  microcephaly and mental retardation. It is caused by mutations in the zinc  finger homeo box 1B gene, ZFHX1B (SIP1). To date, 68 deletion/mutation-positive  cases have been reported. Genitourinary anomalies are common in MWS. Here we  report that hypospadias is common in males with this syndrome. In 39 patients  where this information was available, hypospadias was present in 46% of patients  (18/39). In the 3 Italian male cases reported here, hypospadias was always  present. MWS should be considered by endocrinologists in patients with  hypospadias associated with developmental delays/mental retardation, in  particular in the presence of a distinct facial phenotype.', 'Individuals with Mowat-Wilson syndrome (MWS; OMIM#235730) have characteristic  facial features, a variety of congenital anomalies such as Hirschsprung disease,  and intellectual disabilities caused by mutation or deletion of ZEB2 gene. This  deletion or cytogenetic abnormality has been reported primarily from Europe,  Australia and the United States, but not in Korea. Here we report a patient with  characteristic facial features of MWS, developmental delay and spasticity. High  resolution microarray analysis revealed 0.9 Mb deletion of 2q22.3 involving two  genes: ZEB2 and GTDC1. This case shows the important role of high resolution  microarray in patients with unexplained psychomotor retardation and/or facial  dysmorphism. Knowledge about the most striking clinical signs and implementation  of effective molecular tests like microarray could significantly increase the  detection rate of new cases of MWS in Korea. This is the first reported case of  MWS in Korea.', 'We present a clinical case of a female infant with multiple anomalies and  distinctive facial features, with an exceptionally severe clinical course of  Hirschsprung disease. The girl was also diagnosed with Mowat-Wilson syndrome,  confirmed by molecular analysis as a heterozygous deletion of the ZEB2 gene.  Moreover, molecular karyotyping revealed a deletion involving further genes  (KYNU, ARHGAP15, and GTDC1).', 'Mowat-Wilson syndrome (MWS) is a multiple congenital anomaly syndrome  characterized by a distinct facial phenotype (high forehead, frontal bossing,  large eyebrows, medially flaring and sparse in the middle part, hypertelorism,  deep set but large eyes, large and uplifted ear lobes, with a central  depression, saddle nose with prominent rounded nasal tip, prominent columella,  open mouth, with M-shaped upper lip, frequent smiling, and a prominent but  narrow and triangular pointed chin), moderate-to-severe intellectual deficiency,  epilepsy and variable congenital malformations including Hirschsprung disease  (HSCR), genitourinary anomalies (in particular hypospadias in males), congenital  heart defects, agenesis of the corpus callosum and eye anomalies. The prevalence  of MWS is currently unknown, but 171 patients have been reported so far. It  seems probable that MWS is under-diagnosed, particularly in patients without  HSCR. MWS is caused by heterozygous mutations or deletions in the Zinc finger  E-box-binding homeobox 2 gene, ZEB2, previously called ZFHX1B (SIP1). To date,  over 100 deletions/mutations have been reported in patients with a typical  phenotype; they are frequently whole gene deletions or truncating mutations,  suggesting that haploinsufficiency is the main pathological mechanism. Studies  of genotype-phenotype analysis show that facial gestalt and delayed psychomotor  development are constant clinical features, while the frequent and severe  congenital malformations are variable. In a small number of patients, unusual  mutations can lead to an atypical phenotype. The facial phenotype is  particularly important for the initial clinical diagnosis and provides the  hallmark warranting ZEB2 mutational analysis, even in the absence of HSCR. The  majority of MWS cases reported so far were sporadic, therefore the recurrence  risk is low. Nevertheless, rare cases of sibling recurrence have been observed.  Congenital malformations and seizures require precocious clinical investigation  with intervention of several specialists (including neonatologists and  pediatricians). Psychomotor development is delayed in all patients, therefore  rehabilitation (physical therapy, psychomotor and speech therapy) should be  started as soon as possible.', 'Mowat-Wilson syndrome (MWS) is a rare mental retardation-multiple congenital  anomalies syndrome associated with typical facial dysmorphism. Patients can show  a variety of other anomalies like short stature, microcephaly, Hirschsprung  disease, malformations of the brain, seizures, congenital heart defects and  urogenital anomalies. Mutations leading to haploinsufficiency of the ZFHX1B gene  have been described as the underlying cause of this condition. We report on the  clinical findings in a 2(1/2)-year-old boy with some aspects out of the  MWS-spectrum in addition to unusual anomalies and a novel missense mutation in  the ZFHX1B gene.', 'Mowat-Wilson syndrome (MWS) is a mental retardation syndrome associated with  distinctive facial features, microcephaly, epilepsy, and a variable spectrum of  congenital anomalies, including Hirschsprung disease (HSCR), agenesis of the  corpus callosum, genitourinary abnormalities, and congenital heart disease.  Heterozygous mutations or deletions involving the gene ZFHX1B (previously SIP1)  [OMIM 605802] have recently been found to cause MWS. There have previously been  no reports of a sibling recurrence of this syndrome. A brother and sister are  described with clinical features of MWS, where both have the same truncating  mutation in exon 8 of ZFHX1B. As their parents are phenotypically normal and do  not have the mutation in lymphocyte-derived DNA, the most likely explanation is  germ-line mosaicism.', 'Mowat-Wilson syndrome is a genetic condition characterized by a recognizable  facial phenotype in addition to moderate to severe cognitive disability with  severe speech impairment and variable multiple congenital anomalies. The  anomalies may include Hirschsprung disease, heart defects, structural eye  anomalies including microphthalmia, agenesis of the corpus callosum, and  urogenital anomalies. Microcephaly, seizure disorder and constipation are  common.

127,Define pseudotumor cerebri. How is it treated?,"['INTRODUCTION: Pseudotumor cerebri is a condition characterized by raised  intracranial pressure, normal CSF contents, and normal brain with normal or  small ventricles on imaging studies. It affects predominantly obese women of  childbearing age; however, its incidence seems to be increasing among adolescent  and children. While among older children the clinical picture is similar to that  of adults, younger children present demographic and clinical peculiarities.  Different diagnostic criteria for adults and pre-pubertal children have been  proposed. Etiology and pathogenesis are still unclear, particular concerning the  role of obstruction to venous outflow. METHODS: An extensive literature review concerning all the aspects of  pseudotumor cerebri has been performed, both among adults and pre-pubertal  children. CONCLUSION: Pseudotumor cerebri is an avoidable cause of visual loss, both in  adults and children. Few diagnostic measures are usually sufficient to determine  the correct diagnosis. Since pseudotumor cerebri is a diagnosis of exclusion,  the differential diagnosis work out is of special importance. Modern  neuroimaging techniques, especially magnetic resonance imaging and magnetic  resonance venography may clarify the role of obstruction to venous outflow in  each case. Various therapeutic options are available: medical, surgical, and  endovascular procedures may be used to prevent irreversible visual loss.  Treatment is usually effective, and most patients will experience complete  resolution of symptoms without persistent deficits.', 'Pseudotumour cerebri is the name of a syndrome characterized by headache and  papilloedema, with normal cerebral CT/MR studies and CSF with a high pressure  and normal laboratory findings. We describe four patients who fulfilled the  diagnostic criteria of this condition (including normal 0.5T MR studies). They  all had cerebral angiograms showing minor abnormalities localized to the level  of the superior longitudinal sinus. All improved on treatment with  anticoagulants and steroids. In view of these findings we consider that in cases  of pseudotumour cerebri without a clear aetiological factor, an angio MR study  should be done, or if this technique is not available, a cerebral angiogram  should be done, to exclude cerebral venous drainage defects.', 'PURPOSE: Demographic and outcome data in the era of modern neuroimaging are  needed to describe pseudotumor cerebri in children. METHODS: We reviewed the medical records of children less than 18 years old who  were diagnosed with pseudotumor cerebri between 1977 and 1997. We defined  pseudotumor cerebri as (1) increased intracranial pressure, (2) normal or small  ventricles, and (3) normal cerebrospinal fluid composition. The condition might  be idiopathic or the result of a nontumor etiology. RESULTS: Thirty-seven patients had an initial diagnosis of pseudotumor cerebri.  Two patients were subsequently diagnosed with a central nervous system  malignancy and were excluded from further analysis. The remaining 35 patients  included 10 patients with idiopathic pseudotumor cerebri and 25 patients with  disorders reported to be associated with pseudotumor cerebri. The mean age was  10.6 years with a range of 3 to 17 years. Twenty patients (57%) were female and  13 patients (37%) were obese. At presentation 4 patients had a visual acuity  less than 20/40 in the best eye and 10 patients had visual field deficits.  Seventeen patients (49%) had cranial nerve deficits, all of which resolved with  normalization of the intracranial pressure. Follow-up data were obtained on 30  patients. Only one patient had a final visual acuity less than 20/40 in the best  eye, whereas six patients had residual visual field deficits. Ten patients (33%)  had optic nerve atrophy. CONCLUSIONS: There was no gender predominance, and associated etiologic factors  were common in these children with pseudotumor cerebri. Permanent visual loss  occurs in some children with pseudotumor cerebri. Quantitative perimetry and  optic nerve examination were more sensitive than visual acuity determination in  detecting damage to the visual sensory system. In rare instances the patient  diagnosed with pseudotumor cerebri will be found after extended follow-up to  harbor an intracranial neoplasm.', 'Pseudotumor cerebri, or benign intracranial hypertension, is characterized by  intracranial hypertension of unknown etiology typically in obese women <45 years  of age, and can be disabling secondary to headaches and visual disturbances.  Medical management includes pharmaceuticals that reduce cerebrospinal fluid  (CSF) production and lumbar punctures that reduce the CSF volume, both aimed at  reducing intracranial pressure. When medical management fails, surgical CSF  diverting procedures are indicated. Recently it has been demonstrated that dural  sinus stenosis or thrombosis can be responsible for this disease and treated  with endovascular venous stent placement. The intent of this educational  manuscript is to review the clinical presentation of pseudotumor cerebri  patients and discuss the medical, surgical, and endovascular treatment options  for this disease. After reading this paper, the reader should be able to: (1)  understand the pathophysiological basis of pseudotumor cerebri, (2) describe its  presenting signs and symptoms, and (3) discuss the medical, surgical, and  endovascular treatment options.', 'Pseudotumor cerebri is an idiopathic disorder characterized by papilledema and  elevated intracranial pressure without a mass lesion. Most patients are female  and young and are either overweight or have a history of recent weight gain.  Other disease states, such as systemic lupus erythematosus, and drugs, such as  tetracycline, have also been associated with the development of pseudotumor  cerebri. The mechanism is unclear, but is likely related to decreased  cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) resorption. Almost all patients have headache, but the  greatest morbidity of the disorder is visual loss related to optic disc  swelling. Common radiographic findings in pseudotumor cerebri include an empty  sella, dilation of the optic nerve sheaths and elevation of the optic disc. The  CSF, aside from elevated opening pressure, is normal without evidence of  infection or inflammation. Treatment of patients with no or mild to moderate  visual loss is primarily medical, with acetazolamide as the first-line agent.  Acetazolamide decreases CSF production. Furosemide and corticosteroids are  secondary choices. Optic nerve surgery is reserved for patients with severe  visual loss or progression in visual deficits despite medical management.', 'PURPOSE: Demographic and outcome data in the era of modern neuroimaging are  needed to describe pseudotumor cerebri in children.

The elevation  of the intracranial pressure is isolated; therefore, diseases such as cerebral  venous thrombosis or dural fistulas should not be considered as etiologies of  BIH. The exact definition of BIH remains debated, and other terms such as  ""pseudotumor cerebri"" or ""idiopathic intracranial hypertension"" are often used  in the literature. Although we agree that BIH is usually not a so benign  disease, we suggest that BIH is still the most appropriate term to describe this  entity which should be classified as ""secondary BIH"" or ""idiopathic BIH""  depending on whether there are precipitating factors for the development of BIH  or not. We also propose new diagnostic criteria emphasizing the need for  investigations for the diagnostic of secondary and idiopathic BIH. The  management of patients with BIH depends mainly on the presence and severity of  ocular symptoms and signs on which the prognostic of the disease is based.  Repeated lumbar punctures associated with acetazolamide and weight loss are  usually efficient enough. However a surgical treatment (optic nerve sheath  fenestration or lumboperitoneal shunt) is required when appropriate medical  management does not prevent progressive alteration of vision (visual loss or  visual field defect), or when the patients complains of severe, refractory  headaches. Careful follow-up with repeated formal visual field testing may help  preventing a devastating visual loss in these patients.', 'OBJECTIVE Idiopathic intracranial hypertension (IIH), or pseudotumor cerebri, is  a complex and difficult-to-manage condition that can lead to permanent vision  loss and refractory headaches if untreated. Traditional treatment options, such  as unilateral ventriculoperitoneal (VP) or lumboperitoneal (LP) shunt placement,  have high complication and failure rates and often require multiple revisions.  The use of bilateral proximal catheters has been hypothesized as a method to  improve shunt survival. The use of stereotactic technology has improved the  accuracy of catheter placement and may improve treatment of IIH, with fewer  complications and greater shunt patency time. METHODS The authors performed a  retrospective chart review for all patients with IIH who underwent stereotactic  placement of biventriculoperitoneal (BVP) shunt catheters from 2008 to 2016 at  their institution. Bilateral proximal catheters were Y-connected to a Strata  valve with a single distal catheter. We evaluated clinical, surgical, and  ophthalmological variables and outcomes. RESULTS Most patients in this series of  34 patients (mean age 34.4 ± 8.2 years, mean body mass index 38.7 ± 8.3 kg/m2;  91.2% were women) undergoing 41 shunt procedures presented with headache (94.1%)  and visual deficits (85.3%). The mean opening pressure was 39.6 ± 9.0 cm H2O. In  addition, 50.0% had undergone previous unilateral shunt placement, and 20.6% had  undergone prior optic nerve sheath fenestration. After BVP shunt placement,  there were no cases of proximal catheter obstruction and only a single case of  valve obstruction at 41.9 months, with a mean follow-up of 24.8 ± 20.0 months.  Most patients showed improvement in their headache (82.4%), subjective vision  (70.6%), and papilledema (61.5% preoperatively vs 20.0% postoperatively, p =  0.02) at follow-up. Additional primary complications included 4 patients with  migration of their distal catheters out of the peritoneum (twice in 1 patient),  and an infection of the distal catheter after catheter dislodgment. The proximal  obstructive shunt complication rate in this series (2.9%) was lower than that  with LP (53.5%) or unilateral VP (37.8%) shunts seen in the literature.  CONCLUSIONS This small series suggests that stereotactic placement of BVP shunt  catheters appears to improve shunt survival rates and presenting symptoms in  patients with IIH. Compared with unilateral VP or LP shunts, the use of BVP  shunts may be a more effective and more functionally sustained method for the  treatment of IIH.', ""The authors report two cases of pseudotumor cerebri in patients taking lithium  for treatment of bipolar disorder. Pseudotumor cerebri is a poorly understood  syndrome characterized by chronic headaches, bilateral papilledema, and  increased intracranial pressure without localized neurologic signs or symptoms,  intracranial mass, or hydrocephalus. Ventriculography, computed tomography, and  nuclear magnetic resonance imaging reveal normal or small ventricles. Multiple  etiologies may include Vitamin A toxicity, obesity, head trauma, hypothyroidism  or hyperthyroidism, prolonged steroid therapy or its withdrawal, Addison's  disease, Cushing's disease, pituitary insufficiency, and lithium therapy.  Patients treated with lithium whose antidiuretic hormone-cyclic adenosine  monophosphate mechanism is disturbed are most likely to develop pseudotumor  cerebri via disregulation of sodium balance, thyroid-stimulating hormone  production, and glucose metabolism. The authors recommend careful medical  monitoring to avoid iatrogenic effects of lithium, including pseudotumor  cerebri.""]","Benign intracranial hypertension (BIH) is characterized by an elevation of the intracranial pressure not associated with an intracranial process or hydrocephaly, and with normal cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) contents.

Tocilizumab met the primary endpoint in both  of these ongoing, multi-part studies. That is, in TENDER, significantly more  tocilizumab recipients than placebo recipients achieved a JIA American College  of Rheumatology (ACR) 30 response plus absence of fever, as assessed at the end  of a 12-week double-blind treatment period, while in CHERISH, significantly  fewer tocilizumab recipients than placebo recipients experienced a JIA ACR 30  flare during a 24-week double-blind withdrawal period (all patients had  previously received open-label tocilizumab in a 16-week lead-in phase).  Tocilizumab was generally well tolerated in the TENDER trial. Infections (e.g.  upper respiratory tract infection and pharyngitis or nasopharyngitis) accounted  for just over one-third of all reported adverse events in this trial;  tocilizumab-treated patients appeared to have an approximately 11\xa0% risk of a  serious infection per year of treatment.

Serum, plasma  and ascites levels of cytokines, including IL-6 and vascular endothelial growth  factor, were markedly elevated. Tocilizumab, an anti-IL-6 receptor antibody, and  corticosteroids were initially used to treat the increase in acute inflammatory  proteins and the anasarca, resulting in decreased cytokine levels. However, the  patient showed a rapidly progressive course of anasarca and ascites, and an  increase in acute inflammatory proteins and cytokine levels shortly thereafter.  Rituximab, an anti-CD20 antibody, successfully induced remission of disease  symptoms and decreased cytokine levels. The patient was successfully treated  with rituximab despite being refractory to tocilizumab and corticosteroids.  During our patient's clinical course, monitoring cytokine profiles, especially  vascular endothelial growth factor, was useful in tracking the disease activity  of TAFRO syndrome."", 'Tocilizumab is a monoclonal humanized anti-IL-6-receptor antibody used for the  treatment of rheumatoid arthritis. The safety of tocilizumab in HCV patients is  an open question. We report on safety and efficacy of tocilizumab in a  71-year-old female with rheumatoid arthritis and chronic hepatitis C.  Monotherapy with tocilizumab (8\u2009mg/kg every 4 weeks, i.v.) was prescribed after  the discontinuation, determined by clinical inefficacy, of anti-TNF-alfa agents  (adalimumab and, subsequently, etanercept). We have registered an optimal and  rapid clinical response to tocilizumab with early remission (SDAI <3.3 since 4  weeks). The safety was good with no adverse events and maintenance, during a  six-month followup, of normal liver enzymes. These data suggest a good safety  profile of tocilizumab in patients with rheumatoid arthritis and chronic  hepatitis C virus pathology.', ""For many antibodies, each antigen-binding site binds to only one antigen  molecule during the antibody's lifetime in plasma. To increase the number of  cycles of antigen binding and lysosomal degradation, we engineered tocilizumab  (Actemra), an antibody against the IL-6 receptor (IL-6R), to rapidly dissociate  from IL-6R within the acidic environment of the endosome (pH 6.0) while  maintaining its binding affinity to IL-6R in plasma (pH 7.4). Studies using  normal mice and mice expressing human IL-6R suggested that this pH-dependent  IL-6R dissociation within the acidic environment of the endosome resulted in  lysosomal degradation of the previously bound IL-6R while releasing the free  antibody back to the plasma to bind another IL-6R molecule. In cynomolgus  monkeys, an antibody with pH-dependent antigen binding, but not an  affinity-matured variant, significantly improved the pharmacokinetics and  duration of C-reactive protein inhibition. Engineering pH dependency into the  interactions of therapeutic antibodies with their targets may enable them to be  delivered less frequently or at lower doses."", 'Interleukin (IL)-6 has a variety of biological functions. For example, it  stimulates the production of acute-phase reactants (C-reactive protein and serum  amyloid A) and hepcidin which interferes with iron recycling and absorption,  causing iron-deficient anemia, and augments expression of vascular endothelial  growth factor and receptor activator of nuclear factor-κB ligand in synovial  cells, leading to neovascularization and osteoclast formation. IL-6 also acts on  lymphocytes, not only on B cells to stimulate autoantibody production, but also  on naïve T helper cells to promote Th17 cell differentiation. Thus, an imbalance  between T cell subsets possibly contributes to development of rheumatoid  arthritis. Several clinical studies have demonstrated that a humanized anti-IL-6  receptor antibody, tocilizumab, improves clinical symptoms in rheumatoid  arthritis. Tocilizumab prevented radiographic progression of joint destruction  by inhibiting cartilage/bone resorption. Tocilizumab also improved hematological  abnormalities, including hypergammaglobulinemia, high levels of autoantibodies,  and elevation of erythrocyte sedimentation rate and acute-phase proteins.  Importantly, tocilizumab improved quality of life by reducing systemic symptoms,  including fatigue, anemia, anorexia, and fever. These findings have confirmed  that hyperproduction of IL-6 is responsible for the above clinical symptoms,  including joint destruction. Many patients treated with tocilizumab achieved  clinical remission associated with decreased serum IL-6, suggesting that IL-6  enhances autoimmunity. Tocilizumab is a new therapeutic option for rheumatoid  arthritis.', 'INTRODUCTION: Epithelial ovarian cancer (EOC) is the most lethal gynecologic  malignancy worldwide and despite an initial response to therapeutic agents, the  majority of patients have chemoresistant disease. There is no treatment strategy  with proven efficacy against chemoresistant EOC and in this setting, overcoming  therapy resistance is the key to successful treatment. METHODS: This study aimed to investigate expression of interleukin-6 (IL-6)  (IL-6) and IL-6 receptor (IL-6R) in a panel of the EOC cell lines. To achieve  this, the expression of IL-6 and its receptor were compared in the EOC cells  using quantitative reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction. MTT assay  was performed to obtain chemosensitivity of the EOC cells. RESULTS: In this report, we show that expressions of IL6 and IL6R are higher in  therapy-resistant EOC cells compared to sensitive ones. Higher expression of IL6  and its receptor correlated with resistance to certain chemotherapeutic agents.  Moreover, our findings showed that combination of tocilizumab (Actemra; Roche),  an anti-IL-6R monoclonal antibody, with carboplatin synergistically inhibited  growth and proliferation of the EOC cells and the most direct axis for IL-6 gene  expression was NF-κB pathway. CONCLUSION: Collectively, our findings suggest that blockade of the IL-6  signaling pathway with anti-IL-6 receptor antibody tocilizumab might resensitize  the chemoresistant cells to the current chemotherapeutics.', 'Rheumatoid arthritis (RA) is a systemic inflammatory disease characterized by  joint pain, swelling, stiffness, and progressive destruction of the small joints  of the hands and feet. Treatment of RA has improved over the past decade. With  multiple cytokines well-known now to play a role in the pathogenesis of RA,  including tumor necrosis factor alpha, interleukin (IL)-1β, and IL-6, many  targeted biological treatments against these cytokines have emerged, changing  the treatment of this disease. Tocilizumab (TCZ) is a recombinant humanized  monoclonal antibody against the IL-6 receptor and has been approved in many  countries, including the United States, for the treatment of moderate to severe  RA in patients who have not adequately responded to one or more  disease-modifying antirheumatic drugs (DMARDs) or cannot tolerate other approved  drug classes for RA. The aim of this review is to discuss the role of IL-6 in  RA, and to provide an overview of the mode of action, pharmacokinetics, and  safety of TCZ. Furthermore, efficacy studies of TCZ as both monotherapy and  combination therapy will be evaluated. There have been several important  clinical trials evaluating the efficacy and safety of TCZ in RA patients; this  review summarizes this data from 14 key trials with emphasis on Phase III  trials. Review of these trials provides strong evidence that its use, both as  monotherapy and in combination with methotrexate or other DMARDs, is an  effective treatment in reducing the signs and symptoms of RA. TCZ showed  tolerable safety but care is required for its use since there are some important  safety concerns including elevated liver enzymes, elevated low-density  lipoprotein, infections, and gastrointestinal perforations. Additionally, given  the efficacy of TCZ in the treatment of RA, this review discusses how TCZ may be  beneficial in the treatment of other autoimmune diseases, spinal disease,  cardiovascular disease, organ transplantation, and malignancies where elevated  levels of IL-6 may play a role in the pathogenesis of these diseases.']","yes, tocilizumab (actemra) is used to block/antagonize the  il-6 receptor."
129,What syndrome is associated with mutations in lysine methyltransferase 2D KMT2D?,"['Kabuki syndrome (KS) is a rare genetic syndrome characterized by multiple  congenital anomalies and varying degrees of mental retardation. Patients with KS  often present with facial, skeletal, visceral and dermatoglyphic abnormalities,  cardiac anomalies and immunological defects. Mutation of the lysine  methyltransferase\xa02D (KMT2D) gene (formerly known as MLL2) is the primary cause  of KS. The present study reported the case of a 4‑year‑old Chinese girl who  presented with atypical KS, including atypical facial features, unclear speech  and suspected mental retardation. A diagnosis of KS was confirmed by genetic  testing, which revealed a nonsense mutation in exon\xa016 of KMT2D (c.4485C>A,  Tyr1495Ter). To the best of our knowledge, this is a novel mutation that has not  been reported previously. The present case underscores the importance of genetic  testing in KS diagnosis.', 'The recessive mutant mice bate palmas (bapa) - claps in Portuguese arose from  N-ethyl-N-nitrosourea mutagenesis. A single nucleotide, T\u2009>\u2009C, change in exon  13, leading to a Thr1289 Ala substitution, was identified in the lysine  (K)-specific methyltransferase 2D gene (Kmt2d) located on chromosome 15.  Mutations with a loss-of-function in the KMT2D gene on chromosome 12 in humans  are responsible for Kabuki syndrome (KS). Phenotypic characterization of the  bapa mutant was performed using a behavioral test battery to evaluate the  parameters related to general activity, the sensory nervous system, the  psychomotor system, and the autonomous nervous system, as well as to measure  motor function and spatial memory. Relative to BALB/cJ mice, the bapa mutant  showed sensory and psychomotor impairments, such as hypotonia denoted by a  surface righting reflex impairment and hindquarter fall, and a reduction in the  auricular reflex, suggesting hearing impairment. Additionally, the enhanced  general activity showed by the increased rearing and grooming frequency,  distance traveled and average speed possibly presupposes the presence of  hyperactivity of bapa mice compared with the control group. A slight motor  coordination dysfunction was showed in bapa mice, which had a longer crossing  time on the balance beam compared with BALB/cJ controls. Male bapa mice also  showed spatial gait pattern changes, such as a shorter stride length and shorter  step length. In conclusion, the bapa mouse may be a valuable animal model to  study the mechanisms involved in psychomotor and behavior impairments, such as  hypotonia, fine motor coordination and hyperactivity linked to the Kmt2d  mutation.', 'KBG syndrome is a rare, autosomal dominant disorder caused by mutations or  deletions leading to haploinsufficiency for the Ankrin Repeating  Domain-Containing protein 11 (ANKRD11) at chromosome 16q24.3.

Studies have determined that pathogenic variants of the lysine-specific  methyltransferase 2D (KMT2D) and lysine-specific demethylase 6A (KDM6A) genes  are the major causes of KS. The two genes encode different histone-modifying  enzymes that are found in the same protein complex that is critical for cell  differentiation during development. Here we report the results from  next-generation sequencing of genomic DNA from 13 patients who had a clinical  diagnosis of KS based on facial dysmorphism and other KS-specific cardinal  phenotypes. Nine of the 13 patients were confirmed to be carrying heterozygous  pathogenic KMT2D variants, seven of which were truncating and two were missense  substitutions. Overall, we uncovered 11 novel variants - nine in KMT2D and two  in KDM6A. Seven of the novel variants (all KMT2D) were likely causative of the  KS phenotype.

Interestingly, this mutation was previously reported in two cases of IFAP  without keratoderma, which suggests clinical heterogeneicity of the same  mutation in MBTPS2.

Mutations  in the histone H3K4 methyltransferase KMT2D have been identified as the main  cause of Kabuki syndrome, however, the role of KMT2D in heart development  remains to be characterized. RESULTS: Here we analyze the function of Kmt2d at different stages of Xenopus  heart development. Xenopus Kmt2d is ubiquitously expressed at early stages of  cardiogenesis, with enrichment in the anterior region including the cardiac  precursor cells. Morpholino-mediated knockdown of Kmt2d led to hypoplastic  hearts lacking the three-chambered structure. Analyzing different stages of  cardiogenesis revealed that development of the first and second heart fields as  well as cardiac differentiation were severely affected by loss of Kmt2d  function. CONCLUSION: Kmt2d loss of function in Xenopus recapitulates the hypoplastic  heart defects observed in Kabuki syndrome patients and shows that Kmt2d function  is required for the establishment of the primary and secondary heart fields.

130,Which is the main gene signature in Systemic Lupus Erythematosus (SLE)?,"['OBJECTIVE: To study the contribution of interferon-alpha (IFNalpha) and IFNgamma  to the IFN gene expression signature that has been observed in microarray  screens of peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) from patients with  systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE). METHODS: Quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction analysis of healthy  control PBMCs was used to determine the relative induction of a panel of  IFN-inducible genes (IFIGs) by IFNalpha and IFNgamma. PBMCs from 77 SLE patients  were compared with those from 22 disease controls and 28 healthy donors for  expression of IFIGs. RESULTS: Expression of IFNalpha-inducible genes was significantly higher in SLE  PBMCs than in those from disease controls or healthy donors. The level of  expression of all IFIGs in PBMCs from SLE patients with IFNalpha pathway  activation correlated highly with the inherent responsiveness of those genes to  IFNalpha, suggesting coordinate activation of that cytokine pathway. Expression  of genes preferentially induced by IFNgamma was not significantly increased in  SLE PBMCs compared with control PBMCs. IFNalpha-regulated gene-inducing activity  was detected in some SLE plasma samples. CONCLUSION: The coordinate activation of IFNalpha-induced genes is a  characteristic of PBMCs from many SLE patients, supporting the hypothesis that  IFNalpha is the predominant stimulus for IFIG expression in lupus.', 'OBJECTIVE: To evaluate the safety and tolerability of multiple intravenous (IV)  doses of sifalimumab in adults with moderate-to-severe systemic lupus  erythematosus (SLE). METHODS: In this multicenter, double-blind, placebo-controlled, sequential  dose-escalation study, patients were randomized 3:1 to receive IV sifalimumab  (0.3, 1.0, 3.0, or 10.0 mg/kg) or placebo every 2 weeks to week 26, then  followed up for 24 weeks. Safety assessment included recording of  treatment-emergent adverse events (AEs) and serious AEs. Pharmacokinetics,  immunogenicity, and pharmacodynamics were evaluated, and disease activity was  assessed. RESULTS: Of 161 patients, 121 received sifalimumab (26 received 0.3 mg/kg; 25,  1.0 mg/kg; 27, 3.0 mg/kg; and 43, 10 mg/kg) and 40 received placebo. Patients  were predominantly female (95.7%). At baseline, patients had moderate-to-severe  disease activity (mean SLE Disease Activity Index score 11.0), and most (75.2%)  had a high type I interferon (IFN) gene signature. In the sifalimumab group  versus the placebo group, the incidence of ≥1 treatment-emergent AE was 92.6%  versus 95.0%, ≥1 serious AE was 22.3% versus 27.5%, and ≥1 infection was 67.8%  versus 62.5%; discontinuations due to AEs occurred in 9.1% versus 7.5%, and  death occurred in 3.3% (n=4) versus 2.5% (n=1). Serum sifalimumab concentrations  increased in a linear and dose-proportional manner. Inhibition of the type I IFN  gene signature was sustained during treatment in patients with a high baseline  signature. No statistically significant differences in clinical activity (SLEDAI  and British Isles Lupus Assessment Group score) between sifalimumab and placebo  were observed. However, when adjusted for excess burst steroids, SLEDAI change  from baseline showed a positive trend over time. A trend toward normal  complement C3 or C4 level at week 26 was seen in the sifalimumab groups compared  with baseline. CONCLUSION: The observed safety/tolerability and clinical activity profile of  sifalimumab support its continued clinical development for SLE.', 'Recently much attention was attracted to the importance of the type I interferon  pathway in the initiation and development of the autoimmune disease systemic  lupus erythematosus (SLE). Many SLE patients have increased serum levels of  IFN-alpha and display an IFN gene expression ""signature"" characterized by strong  overexpression of IFN-responsive genes in leukocytes and target tissues.  Moreover, about 20% of cancer patients treated with IFN-alpha therapy manifest  symptoms resembling SLE and some later develop the disease. One of the key genes  of the IFN-alpha pathway, IRF5, was found to be strongly associated with SLE.  Two functional SNPs lead to alternative splicing and altered steady-state level  of IRF5 gene expression. Besides, the gene has a polymorphic inserion/deletion  in exon 6, which contributes to the diversity in the isoform pattern of IRF5.  Interestingly, recent studies have not found association of IRF5 with the other  autoimmune diseases, such as rheumatoid arthritis or psoriasis, suggesting the  unique role for IRF5 in the development of lupus. Here, we present the current  knowledge on IRF5 genetics and its biological function and discuss the possible  ways in which IRF5 contributes to susceptibility to SLE.', 'OBJECTIVE: To characterize baseline gene expression and pharmacodynamically  induced changes in whole blood gene expression in 1,760 systemic lupus  erythematosus (SLE) patients from 2 phase III, 52-week, randomized,  placebo-controlled, double-blind studies in which patients were treated with the  BAFF-blocking IgG4 monoclonal antibody tabalumab. METHODS: Patient samples were obtained from SLE patients from the ILLUMINATE-1  and ILLUMINATE-2 studies, and control samples were obtained from healthy donors.  Blood was collected in Tempus tubes at baseline, week 16, and week 52. RNA was  analyzed using Affymetrix Human Transcriptome Array 2.0 and NanoString. RESULTS: At baseline, expression of the interferon (IFN) response gene was  elevated in patients compared with controls, with 75% of patients being positive  for this IFN response gene signature. There was, however, substantial  heterogeneity of IFN response gene expression and complex relationships among  gene networks. The IFN response gene signature was a predictor of time to  disease flare, independent of anti-double-stranded DNA (anti-dsDNA) antibody and  C3 and C4 levels, and overall disease activity. Pharmacodynamically induced  changes in gene expression following tabalumab treatment were extensive,  occurring predominantly in B cell-related and immunoglobulin genes, and were  consistent with other pharmacodynamic changes including anti-dsDNA antibody, C3,  and immunoglobulin levels. CONCLUSION: SLE patients demonstrated increased expression of an IFN response  gene signature (75% of patients had an elevated IFN response gene signature) at  baseline in ILLUMINATE-1 and ILLUMINATE-2. Substantial heterogeneity of gene  expression was detected among individual patients and in gene networks. The IFN  response gene signature was an independent risk factor for future disease  flares. Pharmacodynamic changes in gene expression were consistent with the  mechanism of BAFF blockade by tabalumab.', 'BACKGROUND: Systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) is a complex multi-system  disease, characterized by both autoimmune and autoinflammatory clinical and  laboratory features. The role of type I interferon (IFN) in SLE has been  demonstrated from the 2000s, by gene expression analyses showing significant  over-expression of genes related to type I IFN signalling pathway (IFN  signature). However, several studies questioned the role of measuring the  intensity of IFN signature (IFN score) to chase SLE activity. We would assess if  the IFN signature can help the clinical and therapeutic stratification of  patients with pediatric SLE. METHODS: We measured the IFN score in peripheral whole blood from a series of  subjects with childhood-onset SLE and correlated the results with clinical and  laboratory parameters. RESULTS: Thirty-one subjects were included in the study, among which the 87%  displayed a positive IFN score. The only significant relation was found for high  IFN score in subjects with normocomplementemia. No correlation was observed  between IFN score and SLEDAI-2K, BILAG-2004 and SLICC. Patients with high IFN  score and normal complement levels also presented lower anti-dsDNA antibodies. CONCLUSIONS: The integration between IFN signature analysis and complement  levels may easily distinguish two groups of subjects, in which the autoimmune or  autoinflammatory component of the disease seems to be prevalent.', 'OBJECTIVES: Altered signalling in B cells is a predominant feature of systemic  lupus erythematosus (SLE). The genes BANK1 and BLK were recently described as  associated with SLE. BANK1 codes for a B-cell-specific cytoplasmic protein  involved in B-cell receptor signalling and BLK codes for an Src tyrosine kinase  with important roles in B-cell development. To characterise the role of BANK1  and BLK in SLE, a genetic interaction analysis was performed hypothesising that  genetic interactions could reveal functional pathways relevant to disease  pathogenesis. METHODS: The GPAT16 method was used to analyse the gene-gene interactions of  BANK1 and BLK. Confocal microscopy was used to investigate co-localisation, and  immunoprecipitation was used to verify the physical interaction of BANK1 and  BLK. RESULTS: Epistatic interactions between BANK1 and BLK polymorphisms associated  with SLE were observed in a discovery set of 279 patients and 515 controls from  northern Europe. A meta-analysis with 4399 European individuals confirmed the  genetic interactions between BANK1 and BLK. As BANK1 was identified as a binding  partner of the Src tyrosine kinase LYN, the possibility that BANK1 and BLK could  also show a protein-protein interaction was tested. The co-immunoprecipitation  and co-localisation of BLK and BANK1 were demonstrated. In a Daudi cell line and  primary naive B cells endogenous binding was enhanced upon B-cell receptor  stimulation using anti-IgM antibodies. CONCLUSION: This study shows a genetic interaction between BANK1 and BLK, and  demonstrates that these molecules interact physically. The results have  important consequences for the understanding of SLE and other autoimmune  diseases and identify a potential new signalling pathway.', 'Systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) is a chronic autoimmune disease that affects  multiple organ systems. Although the etiology of SLE remains unclear, it is  widely accepted that genetic factors could be involved in its pathogenesis. A  number of genome-wide association studies (GWASs) have identified novel  single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) associated with the risk of SLE in  diverse populations. However, not all the SNP candidates identified from  non-Asian populations have been validated in Koreans. In this study, we aimed to  replicate the SNPs that were recently discovered in the GWAS; these SNPs have  not been validated in Koreans or have only been replicated in Koreans with an  insufficient sample size to conclude any association. For this, we selected five  SNPs (rs1801274 in FCGR2A and rs2286672 in PLD2, rs887369 in CXorf21, rs9782955  in LYST, and rs3794060 in NADSYN1). Through the replication study with 656 cases  and 622 controls, rs1801274 in FCGR2A was found to be significantly associated  with SLE in Koreans (odds ratio, 1.26, 95% confidence interval, 1.06 to 1.50; p  = 0.01 in allelic model). This association was also significant in two other  models (dominant and recessive). The other four SNPs did not show a significant  association. Our data support that FCGR polymorphisms play important roles in  the susceptibility to SLE in diverse populations, including Koreans.', 'OBJECTIVE: The interferon (IFN) signature is related to disease activity and  vascular disease in systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) and antiphospholipid  syndrome (APS) and represents a promising therapeutic target. Quantification of  the IFN signature is currently performed by gene expression analysis, limiting  its current applicability in clinical practice. Therefore, the objective of this  study was to establish an easy to measure biomarker for the IFN signature. METHODS: Serum levels of galectin-9, CXCL-10 (IP-10) and tumour necrosis factor  receptor type II (TNF-RII) were measured in patients with SLE, SLE+APS\u2009and  primary APS (PAPS) and healthy controls (n=148) after an initial screening of  serum analytes in a smaller cohort (n=43). Analytes were correlated to measures  of disease activity and the IFN signature. The performance of galectin-9,  CXCL-10 and TNF-RII as biomarkers to detect the IFN signature was assessed by  receiver operating characteristic curves. RESULTS: Galectin-9, CXCL-10 and TNF-RII were elevated in patients with SLE,  SLE+APS\u2009and PAPS (p<0.05) and correlated with disease activity and tissue factor  expression. Galectin-9 correlated stronger than CXCL-10 or TNF-RII with the IFN  score (r=0.70, p<0.001) and was superior to CXCL-10 or TNF-RII in detecting the  IFN signature (area under the curve (AUC) 0.86). Importantly, in patients with  SLE(±APS), galectin-9 was also superior to anti-dsDNA antibody (AUC 0.70), or  complement C3 (AUC 0.70) and C4 (AUC 0.78) levels in detecting the IFN  signature. CONCLUSION: Galectin-9 is a novel, easy to measure hence clinically applicable  biomarker to detect the IFN signature in patients with systemic autoimmune  diseases such as SLE and APS.', 'Systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) is a prototypical autoimmune disease  characterized by production of autoantibodies against a series of nuclear  antigens. Although the exact cause of SLE is still unknown, the influence of  environment, which is largely reflected by the epigenetic mechanisms, with DNA  methylation changes in particular, are generally considered as key players in  the pathogenesis of SLE. As an important post-translational modification, DNA  methylation mainly suppresses the expression of relevant genes. Accumulating  evidence has indicated that abnormal DNA hypomethylation in T cells is an  important epigenetic hallmark in SLE. Apart from those classic  methylation-sensitive autoimmunity-related genes in lupus, such as CD11a  (ITGAL), Perforin (PRF1), CD70 (TNFSF7), CD40 ligand (TNFSF5) and PP2Acα, the  genome-wide methylation pattern has also been explored recently, providing us a  more and more full-scale picture of the abnormal status of DNA methylation in  SLE. On the other hand, certain miRNAs, RFX1, defective ERK pathway signaling,  Gadd45α and DNA hydroxymethylation have been proposed as potential mechanisms  leading to DNA hypomethylation in lupus. In this review, we summarize current  understanding of T cell DNA methylation changes and the consequently altered  gene expressions in lupus, and how they contribute to the development of SLE.  Possible mechanisms underlying these aberrancies are also discussed based on the  reported literature and our own findings.', 'BACKGROUND: Childhood-onset systemic lupus erythematosus (cSLE) is an incurable  multi-systemic autoimmune disease. Interferon type I (IFN-I) plays a pivotal  role in the pathogenesis of SLE. The objective of this study was to assess the  prevalence of the IFN-I signature and the contribution of cytosolic nucleic acid  receptors to IFN-I activation in a cohort of primarily white cSLE patients. METHODS: The IFN-I score (positive or negative), as a measure of IFN-I  activation, was assessed using real-time quantitative PCR (RT-PCR) expression  values of IFN-I signature genes (IFI44, IFI44L, IFIT1, Ly6e, MxA, IFITM1) in  CD14+ monocytes of cSLE patients and healthy controls (HCs). Innate immune  receptor expression was determined by RT-PCR and flow cytometry. To clarify the  contribution of RNA-binding RIG-like receptors (RLRs) and DNA-binding receptors  (DBRs) to IFN-I activation, peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) from  patients were treated with BX795, a TANK-binding kinase 1 (TBK1) inhibitor  blocking RLR and DBR pathways. RESULTS: The IFN-I signature was positive in 57% of cSLE patients and 15% of the  HCs. Upregulated gene expression of TLR7, RLRs (IFIH1, DDX58, DDX60, DHX58) and  DBRs (ZBP-1, IFI16) was observed in CD14+ monocytes of the IFN-I-positive cSLE  patients. Additionally, RIG-I and ZBP-1 protein expression was upregulated in  these cells. Spontaneous IFN-I stimulated gene (ISG) expression in PBMCs from  cSLE patients was inhibited by a TBK1-blocker. CONCLUSIONS: IFN-I activation, assessed as ISG expression, in cSLE is associated  with increased expression of TLR7, and RNA and DNA binding receptors, and these  receptors contribute to IFN-I activation via TBK1 signaling. TBK1-blockers may  therefore be a promising treatment target for SLE.']",Systemic Lupus Erythematosus (SLE) has a type I interferon (IFN) gene signature.
131,What is Guillain-Barre syndrome (GBS)?,"['Guillain-Barre syndrome (GBS) is an acute immune-mediated progressive  predominantly motor symmetric polyradiculoneuropathy which causes demyelination  and leads to weakness, ataxia and areflexia. There are a variety of forms of the  syndrome; and despite being the most common cause of acute flaccid paralysis in  children, it has a low incidence under 18 years old, and it is even rarer in  children less than 2 years of age. Very few cases have been reported under 12  months of age. We describe a case of an 11-month-old male infant presenting with  weakness and inability to ambulate who was diagnosed with GBS.', 'Guillain-Barré syndrome (GBS) is a potentially life-threatening immune-mediated  acute inflammatory polyneuropathy associated with several antecedent infections.  We report a 20-year-old man with GBS associated with concurrent leptospirosis  and scrub typhus infection. GBS was confirmed with clinical examination and  nerve conduction studies. There have been case reports of GBS in association  with Leptospira and Orienta tsusugamushi separately. However, this may be the  first case report of GBS associated with concurrent diseases.', 'Guillain-Barre Syndrome is a well described acute demyelinating  polyradiculoneuropathy with a likely autoimmune basis characterized by  progressive ascending muscle paralysis.

The first description by Guillain, Barre and Strohl in  1916 established the main clinical and biological characteristics of the  syndrome: acute motor weakness affecting at least one limb associated with  areflexia. The syndrome was at first restricted to the concept of an acute  inflammatory demyelinating polyneuropathy after the first large  electrophysiological and histological studies (Asbury et al., 1969). This  restricted definition of the GBS was changed by the report of Feasby in 1986 of  an axonal variant of the syndrome. This proposal remained controversial until  large studies reported that GBS in Northern China occurs in epidemics,  predominantly involving young adults and children and characterized  electrophysiologically by pure motor axonal features (AMAN). Additional studies  showed that another GBS variant may result from an attack against both motor and  sensory axons (AMSAN). Previously in 1956 CM Fisher described a clinical triad  of ataxia, areflexia and ophthalmoplegia associated with albumino-cytologic  dissociation and excellent recovery which was considered immediately part of the  GBS. The physiopathology of the syndrome was recently determined (anti-GQ1b  antibodies). A number of clinical variant of more limited scope have also been  described. Plasma exchanges and intravenous immunoglobulin (IVIg) are the gold  standard therapies for the demyelinating form and probably for the other  variants despite the absence of controlled trials.', 'Guillain-Barré syndrome (GBS) was first described in 1916 (Guillain G, 1916) and  is approaching its 100th anniversary.

Its etiology is unclear although it has been  associated with both cell- and humoral-mediated autoimmune mechanisms.  Pathophysiologic effects of the disease include inflammation, demyelination of  peripheral nerves, loss of granular bodies and degeneration of the basement  membrane of the Schwann cell. This results in ascending paralysis and loss of  cranial nerve function. Manifestations may be acute or chronic, and temporary or  permanent, depending upon the degree of neuronal destruction. Due to the  pervasive nature of GBS, nursing care is a challenge. Assessment of motor,  respiratory and cardiac function is of key importance. Total care of the patient  focuses on risks related to impaired mobility and ineffective airway clearance.  Psychosocial care and patient education are also integral components of care.', 'Knowledge concerning Guillain-Barré syndrome (GBS) has been largely extended  these past ten years.

Various clinical variants  of GBS have been described. Isolated cranial nerve involvement without prominent  signs of GBS is considered as rare variant of this disease. The aim of the study  was to identify clinical characteristics of various forms of GBS particularly in  rare variants of the disease. 57 patients with GBS were evaluated based on  clinical and electrophysiological data. The following forms of GBS were  revealed: 27 had acute inflammatory demyelinating polyradiculoneuropathy,  9--acute motor axonal neuropathy, 12--acute motor and sensory axonal neuropathy,  5--Fisher syndrome and 3--facial diplegia (rare clinical variant). 50 patients  were graded 3 or more according to Hughes functional grading scale. Seasonal  preponderance was found in spring (March-May) and autumn (September-November).  23 patients received IVIG and 34 were treated by plasma exchange within two  weeks after onset. Follow up study revealed: 46 recovered satisfactory, 8 were  persistently disabled, 3 died during admission to hospital. Guillain-Barre  syndrome showed seasonal distribution and high frequency of axonal forms.  Intravenous immunoglobulin therapy was more effective than plasma exchange. Poor  outcomes were likely due to severe condition (required mechanical ventilation)  and axonal forms.

132,Is SATB1 positioned close to AT-rich sequences?,"[""A cis-acting DNA regulatory element 3' to the A gamma-globin gene contains eight  distinct regions of DNA-protein interaction distributed over 750 bp of DNA. The  sequences of two foot-printed regions (sites I and IV) are A-T rich and generate  a highly retarded complex on gel shift analysis with nuclear extract from human  erythroleukemia (K562) cells. We have purified a 98-kD protein that reproduces  this gel shift. Tryptic cleavage and peptide sequence analysis demonstrated that  the 98-kD protein is identical to a recently cloned protein, special A-T-rich  binding protein 1 (SATB1), that binds selectively to nuclear  matrix/scaffold-associated regions of DNA (MARs/SARs). We have shown by  functional analysis that the 3' A gamma regulatory element associates with the  nuclear matrix. SATB1 mRNA was identified in K562 cells, and reverse  transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) demonstrated its transcript in  several other hematopoietic lines. Antisera to SATB1 caused ablation of the gel  shift complex generated by both the crude nuclear extract and the purified 98-kD  protein with the site I oligonucleotide. Furthermore, oligonucleotides that bind  SATB1 inhibited formation of the site I gel shift complex when added as excess  unlabeled competitor. An immunoblot analysis of the site I gel shift complex  documented the presence of SATB1. Binding of SATB1 to two sites within the 3' A  gamma regulatory element and its MAR/SAR activity suggests that this element may  influence gene expression through interaction with the nuclear matrix."", 'Base excision repair is initiated by DNA glycosylases that recognize specific  altered bases. DNA glycosylases for oxidized bases carry both a glycosylase  activity that removes the faulty base and an apyrimidinic/apurinic lyase  activity that introduces a single-strand DNA incision. In particular, the CUT  domains within the CUX1 and CUX2 proteins were recently shown to interact with  the 8-oxoguanine (8-oxoG) DNA glycosylase and stimulate its enzymatic  activities. SATB1, which contains two CUT domains, was originally characterized  as a T cell-specific genome organizer whose aberrant overexpression in breast  cancer can promote tumor progression. Here we investigated the involvement of  SATB1 in DNA repair. SATB1 knockdown caused a delay in DNA repair following  exposure to H2O2, an increase in OGG1-sensitive oxidized bases within genomic  DNA, and a decrease in 8-oxoG cleavage activity in cell extracts. In parallel,  we observed an increase in phospho-CHK1 and γ-H2AX levels and a decrease in DNA  synthesis. Conversely, ectopic expression of SATB1 accelerated DNA repair and  reduced the levels of oxidized bases in genomic DNA. Moreover, an enhanced  GFP-SATB1 fusion protein was rapidly recruited to laser microirradiation-induced  DNA damage. Using purified proteins, we showed that SATB1 interacts directly  with OGG1, increases its binding to 8-oxoG-containing DNA, promotes Schiff base  formation, and stimulates its glycosylase and apyrimidinic/apurinic lyase  enzymatic activities. Structure/function analysis demonstrated that CUT domains,  but not the homeodomain, are responsible for the stimulation of OGG1. Together,  these results identify another CUT domain protein that functions both as a  transcription factor and an accessory factor in base excision repair.', 'Special AT-rich sequence-binding protein 1 (SATB1), a DNA-binding protein  expressed predominantly in thymocytes, recognizes an ATC sequence context that  consists of a cluster of sequence stretches with well-mixed A\'s, T\'s, and C\'s  without G\'s on one strand. Such regions confer a high propensity for stable base  unpairing. Using an in vivo cross-linking strategy, specialized genomic  sequences (0.1-1. 1 kbp) that bind to SATB1 in human lymphoblastic cell line  Jurkat cells were individually isolated and characterized. All in vivo  SATB1-binding sequences examined contained typical ATC sequence contexts, with  some exhibiting homology to autonomously replicating sequences from the yeast  Saccharomyces cerevisiae that function as replication origins in yeast cells. In  addition, LINE 1 elements, satellite 2 sequences, and CpG island-containing DNA  were identified. To examine the higher-order packaging of these in vivo  SATB1-binding sequences, high-resolution in situ fluorescence hybridization was  performed with both nuclear ""halos"" with distended loops and the nuclear matrix  after the majority of DNA had been removed by nuclease digestion. In vivo  SATB1-binding sequences hybridized to genomic DNA as single spots within the  residual nucleus circumscribed by the halo of DNA and remained as single spots  in the nuclear matrix, indicating that these sequences are localized at the base  of chromatin loops. In human breast cancer SK-BR-3 cells that do not express  SATB1, at least one such sequence was found not anchored onto the nuclear  matrix. These findings provide the first evidence that a cell type-specific  factor such as SATB1 binds to the base of chromatin loops in vivo and suggests  that a specific chromatin loop domain structure is involved in T cell-specific  gene regulation.', 'BACKGROUND: Special AT rich sequence binding protein 1 (SATB1) plays a crucial  role in the biology of various types of human cancer. However, the role of SATB1  in human nasopharyngeal carcinoma (NPC) remains unknown. In the present study,  we sought to investigate the contribution of aberrant SATB1 expression in the  progression of NPC and its association with the Epstein Barr virus (EBV)-encoded  latent membrane protein 1 (LMP-1). METHODS: Immunohistochemical analysis was performed to detect SATB1 and LMP-1  protein in clinical samples, and the association of SATB1 protein expression  with patient clinicopathological characteristics and LMP-1 expression were  analyzed. SATB1 expression profiles were evaluated in well-differentiated NPC  cell line CNE1, poorly-differentiated CNE2Z, undifferentiated C666-1 and  immortalized nasopharyngeal epithelia NP-69 cells using quantitative RT-PCR,  western blotting and fluorescent staining. After inhibition the SATB1 expression  by using SATB1 specific small interfering RNA in these cell lines, the change of  cell proliferation was investigated by western blotting analysis of PCNA  (proliferating cell nuclear antigen) expression and CCK-8 assay, and the cell  migration was assessed by Transwell migration assay. Finally, the expressions of  SATB1 and PCNA were examined in CNE1 cells that forced LMP-1 expression by  fluorescent staining and RT-PCR. RESULTS: Immunohistochemical analysis revealed that SATB1 protein expression was  elevated in NPC tissues compared to benign nasopharyngeal tissues (P = 0.005).  Moreover, high levels of SATB1 protein expression were positively correlated  with clinical stage (P = 0.025), the status of lymph node metastasis (N  classification) (P = 0.018), distant metastasis (M classification) (P = 0.041)  and LMP-1 expression status (r = 2.35, P < 0.01) in NPC patients. In vitro  experiments demonstrated that an inverse relationship between SATB1 expression  and NPC differentiation status, with SATB1 weakly expressed in NP-69 cells and  CNE1 cells, and significant increasingly expressed in CNE-2Z and C666-1 cells.  Targeted knockdown of SATB1 expression obviously attenuated the proliferation  and migration of highly SATB1-expressing CNE2Z and C666-1 cells, but not NP-69  and CNE1 cells. Interestingly, forced LMP-1 expression in CNE1 cells led to a  surprisingly increasing SATB1 expression and nuclear location, companying with  an up-regulated PCNA expression. CONCLUSIONS: Our results reveal that EBV LMP-1-mediated over-expression of SATB1  is associated with NPC progression, suggesting SATB1 may represent a promising  biomarker and therapeutic target for NPC.', 'SATB1 (special AT-rich binding protein 1) is a global chromatin organizer  regulating the expression of a large number of genes. Overexpression has been  found in various solid tumors and positively correlated with prognostic and  clinicopathological properties. In colorectal cancer (CRC), SATB1 overexpression  and its correlation with poor differentiation, invasive depth, TNM (tumor,  nodes, metastases) stage and prognosis have been demonstrated. However, more  detailed studies on the SATB1 functions in CRC are warranted. In this article,  we comprehensively analyze the cellular and molecular role of SATB1 in CRC cell  lines with different SATB1 expression levels by using RNAi-mediated knockdown.  Using siRNAs with different knockdown efficacies, we demonstrate  antiproliferative, cell cycle-inhibitory and proapoptotic effects of SATB1  knockdown in a SATB1 gene dose-dependent manner. Tumor growth inhibition is  confirmed in vivo in a subcutaneous tumor xenograft mouse model using stable  knockdown cells. The in-depth analysis of cellular effects reveals increased  activities of caspases-3, -7, -8, -9 and other mediators of apoptotic pathways.  Similarly, the analysis of E- and N-cadherin, slug, twist, β-catenin and MMP7  indicates SATB1 effects on epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT) and matrix  breakdown. Our results also establish SATB1 effects on receptor tyrosine kinases  and (proto-)oncogenes such as HER receptors and Pim-1. Taken together, this  suggests a more complex molecular interplay between tumor-promoting and possible  inhibitory effects in CRC by affecting multiple pathways and molecules involved  in proliferation, cell cycle, EMT, invasion and cell survival.', 'AIM: Special AT-rich sequence-binding protein 1 (SATB1) is a cell type-specific  matrix attachment region binding protein, functioning as a global genome  organizer. This study aims to investigate the expression pattern and the  prognostic value of SATB1 in colorectal cancer. METHODS AND RESULTS: Prospectively collected data were obtained and tissue  microarrays were constructed from a cohort of 352 patients. SATB1 protein  expression was evaluated by immunohistochemistry and scored by two independent  investigators. SATB1 expression was predominantly nuclear in both normal and  cancer tissues. Loss of SATB1 nuclear expression was seen in 22% of colorectal  cancers compared to 1.5% of adjacent normal colorectal tissue, and was  associated with worse overall survival (P\xa0=\xa00.02) independent of age and stage  of disease (HR 2.48 with 95% CI 1.31-4.70). Loss of SATB1 expression was more  evident in younger patients (P\xa0=\xa00.03), tumours with mucinous or signet ring  histology (P\xa0=\xa00.0001) and poor differentiation (P\xa0=\xa00.005). SATB1 expression  was associated with a survival advantage in patients with Dukes C tumours who  received adjuvant chemotherapy. CONCLUSION: Loss of SATB1 nuclear expression correlates with poor survival and a  less favourable response to adjuvant chemotherapy in colorectal cancer. The  value of SATB1 in individualized colorectal cancer therapy warrants further  evaluation.', 'Special AT-rich sequence binding protein-1 (SATB1) is localized to the nucleus  and remodels chromatin structure in T cells. SATB1-deficient CD4 T cells cannot  respond to TCR stimulation; however, the cause of this unresponsiveness is to be  clarified. Here, we demonstrate that SATB1 is indispensable to proper  mitochondrial functioning and necessary for the activation of signal cascades  via the TCR in CD4 T cells. Naïve SATB1-deficient CD4 T cells contain fewer  mitochondria than WT T cells, as the former do not express mitochondrial  transcription factor A (TFAM). Impaired mitochondrial function in  SATB1-deficient T cells subverts mitochondrial ROS production and SHP-1  inactivation by constitutive oxidization. Ectopic TFAM expression increases  mitochondrial mass and mitochondrial ROS production and rescues defects in the  antigen-specific response in the SATB1-deficient T cells. Thus, SATB1 is vital  for maintaining mitochondrial mass and function by regulating TFAM expression,  which is necessary for TCR signaling.', 'BACKGROUND: Special AT rich sequence binding protein 1 (SATB1) plays a crucial  role in the biology of various types of human cancer.

Because homozygous SATB1-null mice do not survive to adulthood due to non-thymus  autonomous defects, mice were produced that were homozygous for a T  cell-specific SATB1-antisense transgene and heterozygous for a SATB1-null  allele. Thymic SATB1 protein was reduced significantly in these mice, and the  major cellular phenotype observed was a significant reduction in the percentage  of CD8SP T cells in thymus, spleen, and lymph nodes. Mice were smaller than wild  type but generally healthy, and besides a general reduction in cellularity and a  slight increase in surface CD3 expression on CD8SP thymocytes, the composition  of the thymus was similar to wild type. The reduction in thymic SATB1 does not  lead to the variegated expression of CD8-negative single positive thymocytes  seen upon deletion of several regulatory elements and suggested by others to  reflect failure to activate the CD8 locus.

SATB1  expression profile coincides with T lineage commitment and upregulation of SATB1  correlates with positive selection of thymocytes. CD4 thymocytes exhibit a  characteristic bimodal expression pattern that corresponds to immature and  mature CD4 thymocytes.

133,What is the function of the enzymes known as dual specificity phoshpatases (DUSPs)?,"['SIGNIFICANCE: The dual-specificity phosphatases (DUSPs) constitute a  heterogeneous group of cysteine-based protein tyrosine phosphatases, whose  members exert a pivotal role in cell physiology by dephosphorylation of  phosphoserine, phosphothreonine, and phosphotyrosine residues from proteins, as  well as other non-proteinaceous substrates. RECENT ADVANCES: A picture is emerging in which a selected group of DUSP enzymes  display overexpression or hyperactivity that is associated with human disease,  especially human cancer, making feasible targeted therapy approaches based on  their inhibition. A panoply of molecular and functional studies on DUSPs have  been performed in the previous years, and drug-discovery efforts are ongoing to  develop specific and efficient DUSP enzyme inhibitors. This review summarizes  the current status on inhibitory compounds targeting DUSPs that belong to the  MAP kinase phosphatases-, small-sized atypical-, and phosphatases of  regenerating liver subfamilies, whose inhibition could be beneficial for the  prevention or mitigation of human disease. CRITICAL ISSUES: Achieving specificity, potency, and bioavailability are the  major challenges in the discovery of DUSP inhibitors for the clinics. Clinical  validation of compounds or alternative inhibitory strategies of DUSP inhibition  has yet to come. FUTURE DIRECTIONS: Further work is required to understand the dual role of many  DUSPs in human cancer, their function-structure properties, and to identify  their physiologic substrates. This will help in the implementation of therapies  based on DUSPs inhibition.', 'The protein tyrosine phosphatase family (PTP) contains a group of  dual-specificity phosphatases (DUSPs) that regulate the activivity of MAP  kinases (MAPKs), which are key effectors in the control of cell growth and  survival in physiological and pathological processes, including cancer. These  phosphatases, named as MKP-DUSPs, include the MAPK phosphatases (MKPs) as well  as a group of small-size atypical DUSPs structurally and functionally related to  the MKPs. MKP-DUSPs, in most of the cases, are direct inactivators of MAPKs by  dephosphorylation of both the Thr and the Tyr regulatory residues at the MAPKs  catalytic loop. In some other cases, MKP-DUSPs regulate the activity of MAPKs  indirectly, acting through upstream MAPK pathways components. The active  involvement of MKP-DUSPs in oncogenesis or resistance to cancer therapies is now  well documented, making the search and validation of MKP-DUSPs inhibitors a  prominent area in clinical cancer research. Here, we review the current  knowledge on the role of MKP-DUSPs in human cancer, the status of the  preclinical development and validation of specific MKP-DUSP inhibitors, and the  potential of MKP-DUSPs as targets for anti-cancer drugs.', 'Dual specificity phosphatase 1 (DUSP1) dephosphorylates and, hence, regulates  the activity of MAP kinases. The present study investigated the effect of DUSP1  on inflammatory gene expression and on the development of carrageenan-induced  inflammation. It was found that DUSP1 expression was increased by LPS, and the  down-regulation of DUSP1 by siRNA enhanced the phosphorylation of p38 MAPK,  while JNK phosphorylation was not affected in murine macrophages. LPS-induced  interleukin (IL)-6, tumor-necrosis factor (TNF) and cyclooxygenase-2 (COX2)  expression were enhanced in bone marrow-derived macrophages (BMMs) from  DUSP1(-/-) mice as compared to those from wild-type mice. In addition,  down-regulation of DUSP1 by siRNA enhanced IL-6, TNF and COX2 expression in J774  macrophages, while p38 MAPK inhibitors SB202190 and BIRB 796 inhibited the  expression of those inflammatory factors. In vivo, the intensity of the  carrageenan-induced paw edema reaction was increased in DUSP1(-/-) mice as  compared to the wild-type animals. In conclusion, DUSP1 is an important negative  regulator of the acute inflammatory response by limiting p38 MAPK, and compounds  which enhance DUSP1 expression or activity may hold a promise as  anti-inflammatory drugs.', ""Dual-Specificity Phosphatases (DUSPs) are enzymes that remove phosphate groups  from both phospho-tyrosine and phospho-serine/threonine residues. A subgroup of  DUSPs specifically targets Mitogen-Activated Protein Kinases (MAPKs) and has  been shown to participate in the regulation of differential cellular responses  to the large variety of stimuli conveyed by MAPK-pathways. In Drosophila,  Puckered has been identified as a DUSP, exhibiting specificity towards the  c-Jun-N-terminal kinase (JNK). Recent studies have signified its role in  regulating JNK-dependent processes, including immunity, stress tolerance and  longevity. Puckered expression depends on the activation of the JNK pathway  whereas it's degradation is mediated by the ubiquitin-proteasome system. In this  study we show that Puckered is phosphorylated by JNK and p38 in response to  arsenite-induced oxidative stress and that phosphorylation affects the  interaction between Puckered and these MAPKs. In silico analysis of the Puckered  amino acid sequence revealed several MAPK consensus phosphorylation motifs.  Expression of Puckered in the heterologous system of HEK293 cells and subsequent  stimulation with arsenite resulted in reduced mobility of Puckered in SDS-PAGE.  Similar results were obtained when Puckered was co-expressed with the  constitutively active forms of JNK and p38. This mobility shift was abolished by  lambda-phosphatase treatment or by simultaneous inhibition of JNK and p38.  Analysis by mass-spectrometry identified Puckered phosphorylation in Ser413,  though phosphorylation on this site was found irrespective of stimulation.  Finally, phosphorylation of Puckered enhanced its interaction both with JNK and  p38. Our results suggest a possible functional role of Puckered phosphorylation  by MAPKs."", 'BACKGROUND: Angiopoietin-1 (Ang-1) promotes survival and migration of  endothelial cells, in part through the activation of mitogen-activated protein  kinase (MAPK) pathways downstream of Tie-2 receptors. Dual-specificity  phosphatases (DUSPs) dephosphorylate phosphotyrosine and  phosphoserine/phosphothreonine residues on target MAPKs. The mechanisms by which  DUSPs modulate MAPK activation in Ang-1/Tie-2 receptor signaling are unknown in  endothelial cells. METHODS AND RESULTS: Expression of various DUSPs in human umbilical vein  endothelial cells exposed to Ang-1 was measured. The functional roles of DUSPs  in Ang-1-induced regulation of MAPK activation, endothelial cell survival,  migration, differentiation, and permeability were measured using selective siRNA  oligos. Ang-1 differentially induces DUSP1, DUSP4, and DUSP5 in human umbilical  vein endothelial cells through activation of the PI-3 kinase, ERK1/2, p38, and  SAPK/JNK pathways. Lack-of-function siRNA screening revealed that DUSP1  preferentially dephosphorylates p38 protein and is involved in Ang-1-induced  cell migration and differentiation. DUSP4 preferentially dephosphorylates  ERK1/2, p38, and SAPK/JNK proteins and, under conditions of serum deprivation,  is involved in Ang-1-induced cell migration, several antiapoptotic effects, and  differentiation. DUSP5 preferentially dephosphorylates ERK1/2 proteins and is  involved in cell survival and inhibition of permeability. CONCLUSIONS: DUSP1, DUSP4, and DUSP5 differentially modulate MAPK signaling  pathways downstream of Tie-2 receptors, thus highlighting the importance of  these phosphatases to Ang-1-induced angiogenesis.', 'The common substrate structure for the functionally diverse Nudix protein  superfamily is nucleotide-diphosphate-X, where X is a large variety of leaving  groups. The substrate specificity is known for less than 1% of the 29,400 known  members. Most activities result in the release of an inorganic phosphate ion or  of a product bearing a terminal phosphate moiety. Reactions have typically been  monitored by a modification of the discontinuous Fiske-SubbaRow assay, which is  relatively insensitive and slow. We report here the development of a continuous  fluorescence assay that enables the rapid and accurate determination of  substrate specificities in a 96-well format. We used this novel assay to confirm  the reported substrate characterizations of MutT and NudD of Escherichia coli  and to characterize DR_1025 of Deinococcus radiodurans and MM_0920 of  Methanosarcina mazei. Novel findings enabled by the new assay include the  following. First, in addition to the well-characterized hydrolysis of 8-oxo-dGTP  at the α-β position, MutT cleaves at the β-γ phosphate bond at a rate of 3% of  that recorded for hydrolysis at the α-β position. Second, MutT also catalyzes  the hydrolysis of 5-methyl-dCTP. Third, 8-oxo-dGTP was observed to be the best  substrate for DR_1025 of the 41 compounds screened.', 'Down-regulation of DUSP5 has been shown to increase cell proliferation. DUSP5  expression is regulated through epigenetic events involving LncRNA H19 human  choriocarcinoma cell line. However, the molecular mechanisms of H19 modulating  the DUSP5 expression in cardiac fibrosis remain largely unknown. Here, we  identify H19 negatively regulation of DUSP5 gene expression in cardiac  fibroblast and fibrosis tissues. In vivo, the expression levels of H19, DUSP5,  α-SMA, p-ERK1/2, and ERK1/2 in cardiac fibrosis tissue were estimated by Western  blotting, quantitative reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction and  immunohistochemistry. In vitro stimulation of freshly isolated rat cardiac  fibroblasts with recombinant marine TGF-β1 was performed, followed by  quantitative reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction and Western  blotting to detect changes in H19, DUSP5, p-ERK1/2, and ERK1/2 levels. Cardiac  fibroblasts were transfected with pEX-3-H19 overexpressing, H19-RNAi  down-regulating, or pEGFP-C1-DUSP5 overexpressing. Finally, cell proliferation  was assessed by the MTT assay and cell cycle. H19 endogenous expression is  overexpressed in cardiac fibroblast and fibrosis tissues, and an opposite  pattern is observed for DUSP5. H19 ectopic overexpression reduces DUSP5  abundance and increases the proliferation of cardiac fibroblast, whereas H19  silencing causes the opposite effects. In a broader perspective, these results  demonstrated that LncRNA H19 contributes to cardiac fibroblast proliferation and  fibrosis, which act in part through repression of DUSP5/ERK1/2.', ""Decapping scavenger (DcpS) enzymes catalyze the cleavage of a residual cap  structure following 3' → 5' mRNA decay. Some previous studies suggested that  both m(7)GpppG and m(7)GDP were substrates for DcpS hydrolysis. Herein, we show  that mononucleoside diphosphates, m(7)GDP (7-methylguanosine diphosphate) and  m(3)(2,2,7)GDP (2,2,7-trimethylguanosine diphosphate), resulting from mRNA  decapping by the Dcp1/2 complex in the 5' → 3' mRNA decay, are not degraded by  recombinant DcpS proteins (human, nematode, and yeast). Furthermore, whereas  mononucleoside diphosphates (m(7)GDP and m(3)(2,2,7)GDP) are not hydrolyzed by  DcpS, mononucleoside triphosphates (m(7)GTP and m(3)(2,2,7)GTP) are,  demonstrating the importance of a triphosphate chain for DcpS hydrolytic  activity. m(7)GTP and m(3)(2,2,7)GTP are cleaved at a slower rate than their  corresponding dinucleotides (m(7)GpppG and m(3)(2,2,7)GpppG, respectively),  indicating an involvement of the second nucleoside for efficient DcpS-mediated  digestion. Although DcpS enzymes cannot hydrolyze m(7)GDP, they have a high  binding affinity for m(7)GDP and m(7)GDP potently inhibits DcpS hydrolysis of  m(7)GpppG, suggesting that m(7)GDP may function as an efficient DcpS inhibitor.  Our data have important implications for the regulatory role of m(7)GDP in mRNA  metabolic pathways due to its possible interactions with different cap-binding  proteins, such as DcpS or eIF4E."", 'Filopodia are highly dynamic finger-like cell protrusions filled with parallel  bundles of actin filaments. Previously we have shown that Diaphanous-related  formin dDia2 is involved in the formation of filopodia. Another key player for  the formation of filopodia across many species is vasodilator-stimulated  phosphoprotein (VASP). It has been proposed that the essential role of VASP for  formation of filopodia is its competition with capping proteins for filament  barbed-end interaction. To better understand the function of VASP in filopodium  formation, we analyzed the in vitro and in vivo properties of Dictyostelium VASP  (DdVASP) and extended our findings to human VASP. Recombinant VASP from both  species nucleated and bundled actin filaments, but did not compete with capping  proteins or block depolymerization from barbed ends. Together with the finding  that DdVASP binds to the FH2 domain of dDia2, these data indicate that the  crucial role of VASP in filopodium formation is different from uncapping of  actin filaments. To identify the activity of DdVASP required in this process,  rescue experiments of DdVASP-null cells with mutant DdVASP constructs were  performed. Only WT DdVASP, but not a mutant lacking the F-actin bundling  activity, could rescue the ability of these cells to form WT-like filopodia. Our  data suggest that DdVASP is complexed with dDia2 in filopodial tips and support  formin-mediated filament elongation by bundling nascent actin filaments.', 'Analytical advantages of using multiple enzymes for sample digestion (MED),  primarily an increase of sequence coverage, have been reported in several  studies. However, this approach is only rarely used, mainly because it requires  additional sample and mass spectrometric measurement time. We have previously  described Filter Aided Sample Preparation (FASP), a type of proteomic reactor,  in which samples dissolved in sodium dodecyl sulfate (SDS) are digested in an  ultrafiltration unit. In FASP, such as in any other preparation protocol, a  portion of sample remains after digestion and peptide elution. Making use of  this fact, we here develop a protocol enabling consecutive digestion of the  sample with two or three enzymes. By use of the FASP method, peptides are  liberated after each digestion step and remaining material is subsequently  cleaved with the next proteinase. We observed excellent performance of the  ultrafiltration devices in this mode, allowing efficient separation of  orthogonal populations of peptides, resulting in an increase in the numbers of  identified peptides and proteins. At the low microgram level, we found that the  consecutive use of endoproteinases LysC and trypsin enabled identification of up  to 40% more proteins and phosphorylation sites in comparison to the commonly  used one-step tryptic digestion. MED-FASP offers efficient exploration of  previously unused sample material, increasing depth of proteomic analyses and  sequence coverage.']","DUSPs (dual-specificity phosphatases) are a heterogeneous group of protein phosphatases that can dephosphorylate both phosphotyrosine and phosphoserine/phosphothreonine residues within the one substrate.

DUSPs can be divided into six subgroups on the basis of sequence similarity that include slingshots, PRLs (phosphatases of regenerating liver), Cdc14 phosphatases (Cdc is cell division cycle), PTENs (phosphatase and tensin homologues deleted on chromosome 10), myotubularins, MKPs (mitogen-activated protein kinase phosphatases) and atypical DUSPs."
134,What does Retapamulin treat?,"['BACKGROUND: Patients with atopic dermatitis (AD) are known to have a  predisposition to colonization or infection by microbial organisms, including  both Staphylococcus aureus and herpes simplex virus (HSV). S aureus infection  leads to exacerbation of eczema and may induce flares in atopic skin by  mediating inflammation. Retapamulin 1% ointment is a unique topical antibiotic  formulation that may be a suitable option for the treatment of clinically  infected AD. STUDY DESIGN: A single-center, open-label pilot study was conducted to  investigate the efficacy and safety of retapamulin 1% (Altabax, Stiefel/  GlaxoSmithKline) ointment for the treatment of secondarily infected atopic  dermatitis in subjects aged 9 months to 98 years old (n=29). RESULTS: Twice-daily application of retapamulin 1% produced a mean 8.1-point  reduction from baseline in the mean Skin Infection Rating Scale score. The  majority of subjects achieved clinical cure with topical retapamulin therapy.  Retapamulin 1% ointment was effective against S aureus isolates, including  methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA). Treatment was well  tolerated. CONCLUSION: Retapamulin 1% is effective for the treatment of atopic dermatitis  infected with S aureus, and demonstrates efficacy against both  methicillin-susceptible and methicillin-resistant strains. Given its efficacy  and good tolerability in this pilot study, retapamulin 1% ointment should be  further evaluated as a treatment for infected atopic dermatitis. It may provide  convenience and efficacy with a low risk for development of bacterial  resistance.', 'Invasive infections due to Staphylococcus aureus, including  methicillin-resistant S. aureus are prevalent and life-threatening. Combinations  of antibiotic therapy have been employed in many clinical settings for improving  therapeutic efficacy, reducing side effects of drugs, and development of  antibiotic resistance. Pleuromutilins have a potential to be developed as a new  class of antibiotics for systemic use in humans. In the current study, we  investigated the relationship between pleuromutilins, including valnemulin,  tiamulin, and retapamulin, and 13 other antibiotics representing different  mechanisms of action, against methicillin-susceptible and -resistant S. aureus  both in vitro and in an experimental Galleria mellonella model. In vitro  synergistic effects were observed in combination of all three study  pleuromutilins with tetracycline (TET) by standard checkerboard and/or time-kill  assays. In addition, the combination of pleuromutilins with ciprofloxacin or  enrofloxacin showed antagonistic effects, while the rest combinations presented  indifferent effects. Importantly, all study pleuromutilins in combination with  TET significantly enhanced survival rates as compared to the single drug  treatment in the G. mellonella model caused by S. aureus strains. Taken  together, these results demonstrated synergy effects between pleuromutilins and  TET against S. aureus both in vitro and in vivo.', 'BACKGROUND: Impetigo is a common skin infection, primarily caused by  Staphylococcus aureus and mainly occurring in children. It is usually treated  topically with antibiotics to achieve a quick cure and prevent spread of the  infection. Worldwide, resistance rates of S. aureus against commonly used  antibiotics are rising. Retapamulin belongs to a newly developed class of  antibiotics for the treatment of uncomplicated skin infections. OBJECTIVES: Our aim was to compare the efficacy and safety of topical  application of retapamulin ointment with topical placebo ointment in the  treatment of primary impetigo. METHODS: In a randomized, double-blind, multicentre study, patients received  either topical retapamulin ointment 1% twice daily for 5 days or topical  placebo. Patients were enrolled into the study for 14 days and attended the  clinic for three visits during which clinical and laboratory evaluations were  performed. RESULTS: Two hundred and thirteen patients were randomized, with 139 evaluable  patients in the retapamulin group and 71 in the placebo group. Based on the  primary efficacy endpoint of clinical response after 7 days (intention to  treat), retapamulin ointment was superior to placebo (success rate 85.6% vs.  52.1%; P<0.0001). Similar results were found in the per protocol analysis and in  the subgroup of patients who had a pathogen isolated at baseline. The most  common adverse effect, pruritus at the application site, was reported by 6% and  1% of patients in the retapamulin and placebo groups, respectively. CONCLUSIONS: This study shows that topical retapamulin is effective and safe in  the treatment of primary impetigo, offering a new treatment option.', 'Impetigo is a common childhood skin infection. There are reports of increasing  drug resistance to the currently used topical antibiotics including fusidic acid  and mupirocin. Retapamulin is a newer topical agent of pleuromutilin class  approved by the Food and Drug Administration for treatment of impetigo in  children and has been recently made available in the Indian market. It has been  demonstrated to have low potential for the development of antibacterial  resistance and a high degree of potency against poly drug resistant  Gram-positive bacteria found in skin infections including Staphylococcus aureus  strains. The drug is safe owing to low systemic absorption and has only minimal  side-effect of local irritation at the site of application.', 'Retapamulin is a semisynthetic pleuromutilin derivative being developed as a  topical antibiotic for treating bacterial infections of the skin. It is potent  in vitro against susceptible and multidrug-resistant organisms commonly  associated with bacterial skin infections. We report detailed mode of action  studies demonstrating that retapamulin binds to the bacterial ribosome with high  affinity, inhibits ribosomal peptidyl transferase activity, and partially  inhibits the binding of the initiator tRNA substrate to the ribosomal P-site.  Taken together, these data distinguish the mode of action of retapamulin from  that of other classes of antibiotics. This unique mode of action may explain the  lack of clinically relevant, target-specific cross-resistance of retapamulin  with antibacterials in current use.', 'BACKGROUND: Cutaneous bacterial infections are common in children and adults and  frequently are caused by Staphylococcus aureus (S. aureus). Treatment failures  with topical agents are not uncommon and have been shown to be secondary to  bacterial resistance. OBJECTIVE: To determine clinical and bacteriological efficacy of retapamulin  ointment 1% in treatment of patients with cutaneous bacterial infections caused  by methicillin-resistant S. aureus (MRSA) and other bacteria. METHODS: Prospective, nonrandomized, uncontrolled, open label, single center  trial conducted between April 2008 and November 2012 that evaluated efficacy of  retapamulin ointment 1% in the treatment of impetigo, folliculitis, and other  minor soft tissue infections in children and adults. Fifty patients, who  presented to a dermatology outpatient clinic and were clinically diagnosed with  impetigo, folliculitis, or minor soft tissue infection suitable for treatment  with a topical antibiotic, were screened. Thirty-eight patients were enrolled  and received treatment: topical retapamulin ointment 1% twice daily for 5 days.  Seven patients were MRSA positive and qualified for the primary efficacy  population. One patient withdrew due to an adverse event. Clinical and  microbiological exams were performed at baseline and follow-up 5 to 7 days later  to assess clinical, microbiological, and therapeutic responses. Primary outcome  was clinical response at follow-up in primary efficacy population with MRSA  isolated as the baseline pathogen. Secondary outcomes included clinical,  microbiologic, and therapeutic responses in patients who were culture positive  for any species of bacteria. RESULTS: Clinical response at follow-up in the primary efficacy population  (MRSA-positive patients) was not sufficiently powered to demonstrate  significance; however, outcomes were excellent, with 7 of 7 patients  demonstrating clinical success (5 of 7) or clinical improvement (2 of 7) at  follow-up. Barring lack of significance due to small total sample size for  patients who were culture positive for any species of bacteria (n = 35), overall  success rates were favorable for clinical, microbiologic, and therapeutic  responses with values of 66%, 97%, and 69%, respectively. Adverse events (AEs)  were mild or moderate in severity. No serious AEs were reported. CONCLUSION: Safety profile appears favorable given the low number of AEs. Study  design limits conclusions that can be drawn. Nevertheless, this study supports  use of topical retapamulin 1% ointment in treatment of cutaneous bacterial  infections, particularly those caused by S. aureus, including MRSA.', 'Retapamulin, the first pleuromutilin antimicrobial agent approved for the  topical treatment of skin infections in humans, was tested against 987 clinical  isolates representing 30 species and/or resistance groups. MICs were determined  along with disk diffusion zone diameters using a 2-microg disk. Population  distribution and MIC versus disk zone diameter scattergrams were analyzed to  determine microbiological MIC cutoff values and inhibition zone correlates.  Minimum bactericidal concentrations were performed on a smaller subset of key  species. The retapamulin MIC(90) against 234 Staphylococcus aureus isolates and  110 coagulase-negative staphylococci was 0.12 microg/ml. Retapamulin MIC(90)s  ranged from 0.03 to 0.06 microg/ml against beta-hemolytic streptococci including  102 Streptococcus pyogenes, 103 Streptococcus agalactiae, 59 group C  Streptococcus, and 71 group G Streptococcus isolates. The MIC(90) against 55  viridans group streptococci was 0.25 microg/ml. Retapamulin had very little  activity against 151 gram-negative bacilli and most of the Enterococcus species  tested. Based on the data from this study, for staphylococci, MICs of <or=0.5,  1, and >or=2 microg/ml with corresponding disk diffusion values of >or=20 mm, 17  to 19 mm, and <or=16 mm can be proposed for susceptible, intermediate, and  resistant microbiological cutoffs, respectively. For beta-hemolytic  streptococci, a susceptible-only MIC of <or=0.25 microg/ml with a corresponding  disk diffusion value of >or=15 mm can be proposed for susceptible-only  microbiological cutoffs.', 'Staphylococcus aureus (S. aureus) is the leading cause of nosocomial infections  and responsible for more than 11 million skin and soft tissue infections  annually. Impetigo is a common skin infection and the most common bacterial skin  infection in children aged two to five years. The emergence of S. aureus  isolates resistant to commonly utilized antibacterials for skin infections  (beta-lactams, erythromycin, fluoroquinolones and mupirocin) makes successful  treatment an ongoing challenge. To treat skin infections such as impetigo,  antibacterials with a short dosing schedule and low propensity to develop  resistance should be used. In 2007, retapamulin was the first agent for human  use approved in the pleuromutilin class of antibacterials in the United States  (U.S.), and is the first topical antibacterial indicated to treat impetigo in  over 20 years. In vitro, retapamulin is highly potent against S. aureus and has  a lower propensity to develop resistance than mupirocin. In clinical studies,  the convenient five-day b.i.d. (twice-daily) dosing of retapamulin is highly  effective against impetigo due to methicillin- susceptible S. aureus and  Streptococcus pyogenes and may play an important role in limiting the  development of resistance against systemic agents.', 'Invasive infections due to Staphylococcus aureus, including  methicillin-resistant S. aureus are prevalent and life-threatening.

135,What are the 4 cardinal signs of inflammation according to Celsus?,"['1. Knowledge of slit lamp illumination techniques along with solid concepts of  the disease processes can allow an understanding of the visible morphologic  structures seen in the disease process during examination with the  biomicroscope. 2. Inflammation can be defined as the interaction between a  stimulus and a host, frequently resulting in some degree of structural change  within the host. 3. The cellular responses include a predictably sequential  order of events. The four cardinal signs of inflammation are redness, swelling,  heat, and pain, phenomena explained at the cellular level.', 'Tumor, calor, rubor, and dolor describe four cardinal signs of inflammation. The  fifth-functio laesa, or loss of function-was promulgated by Rudolf Virchow, who,  in the 19th century, also noted an intricate link between inflammation and  cancer. However, the role of cancer inflammation in driving loss of therapeutic  efficacy has only recently been fully appreciated, as a result of molecular and  immunohistochemical approaches applied in clinical medicine and the availability  of novel agents for modulating inflammation. This review focuses on clinical  evidence from solid malignancies that have shaped our view of how the immune  system regulates cancer development, progression, and response to treatment.  Understanding the multifaceted relationship between inflammation and patient  outcomes has the potential to advance prognostic tools and uncover therapeutic  opportunities for improving clinical outcomes.', ""According to semiotics, which may be defined as the doctrine of the essential  nature and fundamental varieties of signs, objects, and interpretants, pain is  considered to be a sign (significant) with very different meanings  (significance) either as a naturalistic symptom (of disease) or as a symbol used  in a metaphorical context. When following this methodological perspective it is  possible to interpret medical as well as poetic writings on equal terms. In  Graeco-Roman medical texts pain was mostly understood as a result and an  indicator of disease, but nonetheless as a symptom which seemed to be actively  produced by the affected body. Especially in the Corpus Hippocraticum dating  from the 5th and 4th century B. C. this materialistic and at the same time  psychosomatic attitude can be noticed. Aristotle (4th century B. C.), Celsus  (1st century A. D.), and the famous experimental physiologist Galen (2nd century  A. D.) agreed that pain was a sign of evil which should be fought without  exception. It was Galen who added the disturbance of function (functio laesa) as  the fifth cardinal sign of inflammation to the four well-known cardinal signs of  Celsus (rubor, calor, tumor, dolor). He also coined the term [see text] to  characterize an attack of migraine. In algotherapy, Galen used a complex  pharmacological system which was based upon the four cardinal qualities of  humoral pathology. On the other hand, pain was designed as a multi-dimensional  symbol by the famous Graeco-Roman epic poets. In Homer's Odyssey (8th century B.  C.), pain appears transformed into the shape of a scar which is visible and  palpable on the hero's leg like an identification tag, whereas in Virgil's  Aeneids (1st century B. C.) pain symbolizes weakness and defencelessness which  can only be alleviated by the goddess Venus."", ""The concept of the four cardinal signs of acute inflammation comes from  antiquity as rubor et tumor cum calore et dolore, (redness and swelling with  heat and pain) extended later by functio laesa (loss of function). The  contemporary understanding of this process we owe to 19th-century milestone  discoveries by Rudolph Virchow, Julius Cohnheim and Elie Metchnikoff. In the  20th century, the development of potent technological tools allowed the rapid  expansion of knowledge of the cells and mediators of inflammatory processes, as  well as the molecular mechanisms of their interactions. It turned out that some  mediators of inflammation have both local and distant targets, among them the  liver (responding by the production of several acute phase reactants) and  neurohormonal centers. In the last decades it has become clear that the immune  system shares mediators and their receptors with the neurohormonal system of the  body; thus, they form a common homeostatic entity. Such an integrative view,  introduced by J. Edwin Blalock, when combined with Hans Selye's concept of  stress, led to the contemporary understanding of sickness behavior, defined by  Robert Dantzer as a highly organized strategy of the organism to fight  infections and to respond to other environmental stressors."", 'PURPOSE: The aim of this study was to examine the literature with respect to  inflammation of the ocular surface and the presence of inflammatory mediators in  the tear film during contact lens wear. METHODS: The literature on contact lens discomfort that relates to signs of  inflammation was searched. Reference was paid to the cardinal signs of  inflammation (pain, heat, redness, and swelling) as well as the appearance of  inflammatory mediators in the tear film during contact lens wear. RESULTS: Contact lens wear does induce discomfort, which is a mild form of pain,  and wearing of lenses can induce increases in limbal and conjunctival redness.  However, there is little evidence for a direct relationship between limbal or  conjunctival redness and contact lens discomfort. Contact lenses may increase  the temperature of the ocular surface by a small amount (≤2.1°C). Corneal or  conjunctival swelling has not been associated with contact lens discomfort.  Complement or kinin breakdown products or histamine in tears are not associated  with contact lens discomfort. Cytokines are generally not related to discomfort,  although nerve growth factor levels were increased in tears of symptomatics in  one report. The presence of degraded lipids, leukotriene B4 and peroxidation  products, and the enzyme secretory phospholipase A2 in tears has been associated  with contact lens discomfort, and this area is worthy of further research. CONCLUSIONS: There have been only a few studies that have investigated a role  for inflammation in contact lens-induced discomfort, and the strongest  associations have been found with lipid degradation processes.', ""HISTORY AND CLINICAL FINDINGS: A 27-year-old man was referred to the  dermatological out-patient clinic because of inflammatory changes in the oral  mucosa of unknown cause. 5 months earlier he had been diagnosed as having  Crohn's disease of the terminal ileum. On both sides of the buccal mucosa there  were rough erythematous vegetations and disseminated miliary abscesses, which  extended to the labial gingiva and the soft palate. Further physical examination  was unremarkable. INVESTIGATIONS: Several inflammatory parameters were increased: C-reactive  protein 100 mg/l, erythrocyte sedimentation rate 55/88 mm, eosinophilic cationic  protein 35.8 ng/ml (normal range 2.3-16 ng/ml). White cell count was normal  (7,25/nl), with a lymphocytopenia of 11.9%. There was no eosinophilia.  Haemoglobin was reduced to 11.6 g/dl and the platelets raised to 526/nl. Smears  of the oral mucosa showed no fungal, viral or bacterial infection. Biopsy  revealed leucocytic microabscesses in the epithelium, granulation tissue and  flat ulcerations with adjoining superficial necrotic zones. DIAGNOSIS, TREATMENT AND COURSE: The clinical and histological picture as well  as the association with Crohn's disease (CD) suggested pyostomatitis vegetans  (PV). The PV was treated with disinfectant mouth washes which improved the  subjective findings. Budesonide was given for CD. CONCLUSION: PV is a rare and usually isolated condition, but it can also occur  in association with a chronic gastrointestinal disease such as ulcerative  colitis and Crohn's disease. The diagnosis of PV indicates a thorough  gastroenterological investigation."", 'IMPORTANCE: To date, no study has characterized the mucocutaneous features seen  in hospitalized children with multisystem inflammatory syndrome in children  (MIS-C) or the temporal association of these findings with the onset of systemic  symptoms.

RESULTS: Twenty-five children (11 girls [44%]; median age, 3 years [range,  0.7-17 years]) were identified who met definitional criteria for MIS-C; an  additional 10 children (5 girls [50%]; median age, 1.7 years [range, 0.2-15  years]) were included as probable MIS-C cases (patients met all criteria with  the exception of laboratory test evidence of severe acute respiratory syndrome  coronavirus 2 [SARS-CoV-2] infection or known exposure). The results of  polymerase chain reaction tests for SARS-CoV-2 were positive for 10 patients  (29%), and the results of SARS-CoV-2 immunoglobulin G tests were positive for 19  patients (54%). Of the 35 patients, 29 (83%) exhibited mucocutaneous changes,  with conjunctival injection (n\u2009=\u200921), palmoplantar erythema (n\u2009=\u200918), lip  hyperemia (n\u2009=\u200917), periorbital erythema and edema (n\u2009=\u20097), strawberry tongue  (n\u2009=\u20098), and malar erythema (n\u2009=\u20096) being the most common findings. Recognition  of mucocutaneous findings occurred a mean of 2.7 days (range, 1-7 days) after  the onset of fever. The duration of mucocutaneous findings varied from hours to  days (median duration, 5 days [range, 0-11 days]). Neither the presence nor  absence of mucocutaneous findings was significantly associated with overall  disease severity. CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE: In this case series of hospitalized children with  suspected MIS-C during the COVID-19 pandemic, a wide spectrum of mucocutaneous  findings was identified. Despite their protean and transient nature, these  mucocutaneous features serve as important clues in the recognition of MIS-C.', ""BACKGROUND: Lucio's phenomenon is a rare manifestation of untreated leprosy  which is seen almost exclusively in regions surrounding the Gulf of Mexico. Its  occurrence elsewhere though documented is considered uncommon. We present a case  of Lucio's phenomenon in a previously undiagnosed leprosy patient who presented  to us with its classical skin manifestations. CASE PRESENTATION: A 64 year old South Asian (Sri Lankan) male with a history of  chronic obstructive airway disease presented to us with fever and cough. He had  a generalized smooth and shiny skin with ulcerating skin lesions afflicting the  digits of the fingers. The lesions progressed to involve the extremities of the  body and healed with crusting. Based on the clinical and investigational  findings Tuberculosis and common vasculitic conditions were suspected and  excluded. The unusual skin manifestations prompted a biopsy, and wade fite  stained revealed Mycobacterium bacilli. In context of the clinical picture and  histological findings, Lucio's phenomenon was suspected. A clinical diagnosis of  Lucio's phenomenon occurring in the backdrop of lepromatous leprosy was made. CONCLUSION: Though leprosy is still a prevalent disease, it has manifestations  that are not easily recognized or fully appreciated. Regional patterns of  atypical manifestations should not limit better understanding of rarer  manifestations as it will aid in clinching an early diagnosis and instituting  prompt treatment, thereby reducing morbidity and mortality."", 'Author information: (1)From the Division of Rheumatology, Department of Medicine, Medical University  of Vienna, Vienna, Austria; Division of Immunology and Rheumatology, Stanford  University Medical Center, Palo Alto, California, USA; Division of Rheumatology,  Department of Internal Medicine, Keio University, Tokyo, Japan; Lilly Research  Laboratories, Eli Lilly and Co., Indianapolis, Indiana, USA; Lilly Research  Laboratories, Eli Lilly and Co., Kobe, Japan; Oregon Health Sciences University,  Portland, Oregon, USA. josef.smolen@meduniwien.ac.at.

Mphis promote the resolution of inflammation through the  induction of apoptosis and phagocytosis of senescent (spent) and bystander  (superfluous) granulocytes. We wished to determine whether MCP-1, which  selectively binds to Mphis, could be used to image subacute and chronic  inflammation. We also sought to image granulocyte apoptosis within these lesions  with technetium-99m labeled annexin V, a marker of apoptotic cells. Sterile  inflammation was induced in 45 12-week-old male Sprague-Dawley rats by deep  intramuscular injection of turpentine into the right thigh. Groups of four to  six animals were then imaged 1 h after tail vein injection of 37-148 MBq (1-4  mCi) of 99mTc-labeled MCP-1 or annexin V 1-14 days after turpentine treatment.  Image analysis showed significantly greater activity of both MCP-1 and annexin V  in inflamed thighs than in control thighs (165%-290% and 188%-313%,  respectively; P<0.01) on days 1-5 after turpentine injection. Dual  autoradiography in animals co-injected with iodine-125 labeled bovine serum  albumin on days 1 and 4 showed specific location of MCP-1 to infiltrating Mphis  while annexin V localized to focal zones of apoptosis within granulocytic  infiltrates adjacent to abscess cavities. Scintillation well counting on day 5  demonstrated significantly higher (P<0.005) ratios of abscess to control thigh  specific activities for MCP-1 (5.83+/-2.17) and annexin V (9.24 +/- 2.8) as  compared to 125I-labeled bovine serum albumin (3.11 +/- 0.65). No significant  increases in uptake were noted at imaging or ex vivo analyses on days 13 and 14,  when lesions were predominately fibrotic. It is concluded that 99mTc-labeled  MCP-1 and 99mTc-labeled annexin V both localize in zones of subacute  inflammation, reflecting the density of Mphis and the incidence of apoptotic  granulocytes, respectively. These agents may be useful in the characterization  of subacute inflammation.']","redness or rubor , heat or calor, swelling or tumor, and pain or dolor"
136,How many DNaseI hypersensitive sites (DHS) mark the murine beta globin locus region?,"[""The beta-globin locus control region (LCR) is contained on a 20 kb DNA fragment  and is characterized by the presence of five DNaseI hypersensitive sites in  erythroid cells, termed 5'HS1-5. A fully active 6.5 kb version of the LCR,  called the muLCR, has been described. Expression of the beta-like globin genes  is absolutely dependent on the presence of the LCR. The developmental expression  pattern of the genes in the cluster is achieved through competition of the  promoters for the activating function of the LCR. Transgenic mice experiments  suggest that subtle changes in the transcription factor environment lead to the  successive silencing of the embryonic epsilon-globin and fetal gamma-globin  promoters, resulting in the almost exclusive transcription of the beta-globin  gene in adult erythropoiesis. In this paper, we have asked the question whether  the LCR and its individual hypersensitive sites 5'HS1-4 can activate a basic  promoter in the absence of any other globin sequences. We have employed a  minimal promoter derived from the mouse Hsp68 gene driving the bacterial  beta-galactosidase (lacZ) gene. The results show that the muLCR and 5'HS3 direct  erythroid-specific, embryonic expression of this construct, while 5'HS1, 5'HS2  and 5'HS4 are inactive at any stage of development. Expression of the muLCR and  5'HS3 transgenes is repressed during fetal stages of development. The transgenes  are in an inactive chromatin conformation and the lacZ gene is not transcribed,  as shown by in situ hybridization. These data are compatible with the hypothesis  that the LCR requires the presence of an active promoter to adopt an open  chromatin conformation and with models proposing progressive  heterochromatization during embryogenesis. The results suggest that the presence  of a beta-globin gene is required for LCR function as conditions become more  stringent during development."", 'The human beta-globin locus is a complex genetic system widely used for analysis  of eukaryotic gene expression. The locus consists of five functional beta-like  globin genes, epsilon, (G)gamma, (A)gamma, delta, and beta, arrayed on the  chromosome in the order that they are expressed during ontogeny. Globin gene  expression is regulated, in part, by the locus control region, which physically  consists of five DNaseI-hypersensitive sites located 6-22 Kb upstream of the  epsilon -globin gene. During ontogeny two switches occur in beta-globin gene  expression that reflect the changing oxygen requirements of the fetus. The first  switch from embryonic epsilon - to fetal gamma-globin occurs at six weeks of  gestation. The second switch from gamma- to adult delta- and beta-globin occurs  shortly after birth. Throughout the locus, cis-acting elements exist that are  dynamically bound by trans-acting proteins, including transcription factors,  co-activators, repressors, and chromatin modifiers. Discovery of novel  erythroid-specific transcription factors and a role for chromatin structure in  gene expression have enhanced our understanding of the mechanism of globin gene  switching. However, the hierarchy of events regulating gene expression during  development, from extracellular signaling to transcriptional activation or  repression, is complex. In this review we attempt to unify the current knowledge  regarding the interplay of cis-acting elements, transcription factors, and  chromatin modifiers into a comprehensive overview of globin gene switching.', ""In mouse and human, the beta-globin genes reside in a linear array that is  associated with a positive regulatory element located 5' to the genes known as  the locus control region (LCR). The sequences of the mouse and human beta-globin  LCRs are homologous, indicating conservation of an essential function in  beta-globin gene regulation. We have sequenced regions flanking the beta-globin  locus in both mouse and human and found that homology associated with the LCR is  more extensive than previously known, making up a conserved block of  approximately 40 kb. In addition, we have identified DNaseI-hypersensitive sites  within the newly sequenced regions in both mouse and human, and these structural  features also are conserved. Finally, we have found that both mouse and human  beta-globin loci are embedded within an array of odorant receptor genes that are  expressed in olfactory epithelium, and we also identify an olfactory receptor  gene located 3' of the beta-globin locus in chicken. The data demonstrate an  evolutionarily conserved genomic organization for the beta-globin locus and  suggest a possible role for the beta-globin LCR in control of expression of  these odorant receptor genes and/or the presence of mechanisms to separate  regulatory signals in different tissues."", ""The human beta-globin locus control region (LCR) consists of four  erythroid-specific DNaseI hypersensitive sites (HSs) at the 5' end of the  beta-globin cluster. The LCR functions over a long distance on chromosome 11 to  regulate transcription and replication of the beta-globin genes. To determine  whether the HSs function independently or as an integrated unit, we analyzed the  requirements for long-range transcriptional activation. If the HSs function  independently, individual HSs would be expected to have long-range activity. In  contrast, if long-range activity requires multiple HSs, individual HSs would  have a limited functional distance. HS2, HS3, and a miniLCR containing multiple  HSs, were separated from a gamma-globin promoter by fragments of phage lambda  DNA. After stable transfection into K562 cells, HS2 had strong enhancer  activity, but only when positioned close to the promoter. HS3 also had strong  enhancer activity, although it was weaker than HS2 and more sensitive to the  spacer DNA. The miniLCR had the strongest enhancer activity and functioned even  at a distance of 7.3 kb. A model is proposed in which synergistic interactions  between HSs confer long-range activation by creating a stable LCR nucleoprotein  structure, which is competent for recruiting chromatin-modifying enzymes. These  enzymes would mediate the well-characterized activity of the LCR to modulate  chromatin structure."", ""The mammalian beta-globin locus is a multigenic, developmentally regulated,  tissue-specific locus from which gene expression is regulated by a distal  regulatory region, the locus control region (LCR). The functional mechanism by  which the beta-globin LCR stimulates transcription of the linked beta-like  globin genes remains unknown. The LCR is composed of a series of 5 DNaseI  hypersensitive sites (5'HSs) that form in the nucleus of erythroid precursors.  These HSs are conserved among mammals, bind transcription factors that also bind  to other parts of the locus, and compose the functional components of the LCR.  To test the hypothesis that individual HSs have unique properties, homologous  recombination was used to construct 5 lines of mice with individual deletions of  each of the 5'HSs of the endogenous murine beta-globin LCR. Here it is reported  that deletion of 5'HS1 reduces expression of the linked genes by up to 24%,  while deletion of 5'HS4 leads to reductions of up to 27%. These deletions do not  perturb the normal stage-specific expression of genes from this multigenic  locus. In conjunction with previous studies of deletions of the other HSs and  studies of deletion of the entire LCR, it is concluded that (1) none of the  5'HSs is essential for nearly normal expression; (2) none of the HSs is required  for proper developmental expression; and (3) the HSs do not appear to synergize  either structurally or functionally, but rather form independently and appear to  contribute additively to the overall expression from the locus."", 'Understanding the molecular basis for phenotypic differences between humans and  other primates remains an outstanding challenge. Mutations in non-coding  regulatory DNA that alter gene expression have been hypothesized as a key driver  of these phenotypic differences. This has been supported by differential gene  expression analyses in general, but not by the identification of specific  regulatory elements responsible for changes in transcription and phenotype. To  identify the genetic source of regulatory differences, we mapped DNaseI  hypersensitive (DHS) sites, which mark all types of active gene regulatory  elements, genome-wide in the same cell type isolated from human, chimpanzee, and  macaque. Most DHS sites were conserved among all three species, as expected  based on their central role in regulating transcription. However, we found  evidence that several hundred DHS sites were gained or lost on the lineages  leading to modern human and chimpanzee. Species-specific DHS site gains are  enriched near differentially expressed genes, are positively correlated with  increased transcription, show evidence of branch-specific positive selection,  and overlap with active chromatin marks. Species-specific sequence differences  in transcription factor motifs found within these DHS sites are linked with  species-specific changes in chromatin accessibility. Together, these indicate  that the regulatory elements identified here are genetic contributors to  transcriptional and phenotypic differences among primate species.', 'Historically, the simplest method to robustly identify active gene regulatory  elements has been enzymatic digestion of nuclear DNA by nucleases such as  DNaseI. Regions of extreme chromatin accessibility to DNaseI, commonly known as  DNaseI hypersensitive sites, have been repeatedly shown to be markers for all  types of active cis-acting regulatory elements, including promoters, enhancers,  silencers, insulators, and locus control regions. However, the original  classical method, which for over 25 years relied on Southern blot, was limited  to studying only small regions of the genome. Here we describe the detailed  protocol for DNase-chip, a high-throughput method that allows for a targeted or  genome-wide identification of cis-acting gene regulatory elements.', 'Epigenetic mechanisms restrict the expression of imprinted genes to one parental  allele in diploid cells. At the Igf2r/Air imprinted cluster on mouse chromosome  17, paternal-specific expression of the Air noncoding RNA has been shown to  silence three genes in cis: Igf2r, Slc22a2, and Slc22a3. By an unbiased mapping  of DNase I hypersensitive sites (DHS) in a 192-kb region flanking Igf2r and Air,  we identified 21 DHS, of which nine mapped to evolutionarily conserved  sequences. Based on the hypothesis that silencing effects of Air would be  directed towards cis regulatory elements used to activate genes, DHS are  potential key players in the control of imprinted expression. However, in this  192-kb region only the two DHS mapping to the Igf2r and Air promoters show  parental specificity. The remaining 19 DHS were present on both parental alleles  and, thus, have the potential to activate Igf2r on the maternal allele and Air  on the paternal allele. The possibility that the Igf2r and Air promoters share  the same cis-acting regulatory elements, albeit on opposite parental  chromosomes, was supported by the similar expression profiles of Igf2r and Air  in vivo. These results refine our understanding of the onset of imprinted  silencing at this cluster and indicate the Air noncoding RNA may specifically  target silencing to the Igf2r promoter.', 'BACKGROUND: In mammals, one of the female X chromosomes and all imprinted genes  are expressed exclusively from a single allele in somatic cells. To evaluate  structural changes associated with allelic silencing, we have applied a recently  developed Hi-C assay that uses DNase I for chromatin fragmentation to mouse F1  hybrid systems. RESULTS: We find radically different conformations for the two female mouse X  chromosomes. The inactive X has two superdomains of frequent intrachromosomal  contacts separated by a boundary region. Comparison with the recently reported  two-superdomain structure of the human inactive X shows that the genomic content  of the superdomains differs between species, but part of the boundary region is  conserved and located near the Dxz4/DXZ4 locus. In mouse, the boundary region  also contains a minisatellite, Ds-TR, and both Dxz4 and Ds-TR appear to be  anchored to the nucleolus. Genes that escape X inactivation do not cluster but  are located near the periphery of the 3D structure, as are regions enriched in  CTCF or RNA polymerase. Fewer short-range intrachromosomal contacts are detected  for the inactive alleles of genes subject to X inactivation compared with the  active alleles and with genes that escape X inactivation. This pattern is also  evident for imprinted genes, in which more chromatin contacts are detected for  the expressed allele. CONCLUSIONS: By applying a novel Hi-C method to map allelic chromatin contacts,  we discover a specific bipartite organization of the mouse inactive X chromosome  that probably plays an important role in maintenance of gene silencing.', 'Double-strand DNA breaks (DSBs) occur at recombination hotspots during  Saccharomyces cerevisiae meiosis and are thought to initiate exchange at these  loci. Analysis of DSB sites in three regions of the yeast genome indicated that  breaks occur at or near many potential transcription promoters and that DSBs  initiate most, if not all, meiotic recombination. DSB sites displayed  deoxyribonuclease I hypersensitivity in chromatin from mitotic and meiotic  cells, and changes in chromatin structure produced parallel changes in the  occurrence of DSBs. Thus, features of chromatin structure that are established  before meiosis play a role in determining where meiotic recombination events  initiate.']","The expression of genes both from the endogenous locus and from transgenes is strongly influenced by a linked 15-kilobase region of clustered DNaseI hypersensitive sites (HSs) known as the locus control region (LCR) Targeted deletion of 5'HS1 and 5’HS4 of the beta-globin locus Control region reveals additive activity of the sites .

Consequently, multiple sequence alignments (MSAs) often are used in  template-based modeling of protein structure and have been incorporated into  fragment-based assembly methods. Our previous homology-free structure prediction  study introduced an algorithm that mimics the folding pathway by coupling the  formation of secondary and tertiary structure. Moves in the Monte Carlo  procedure involve only a change in a single pair of phi,psi backbone dihedral  angles that are obtained from a Protein Data Bank-based distribution appropriate  for each amino acid, conditional on the type and conformation of the flanking  residues. We improve this method by using MSAs to enrich the sampling  distribution, but in a manner that does not require structural knowledge of any  protein sequence (i.e., not homologous fragment insertion). In combination with  other tools, including clustering and refinement, the accuracies of the  predicted secondary and tertiary structures are substantially improved and a  global and position-resolved measure of confidence is introduced for the  accuracy of the predictions. Performance of the method in the Critical  Assessment of Structure Prediction (CASP8) is discussed.', 'We have developed a web-server, TMBETA-NET for discriminating outer membrane  proteins and predicting their membrane spanning beta-strand segments. The amino  acid compositions of globular and outer membrane proteins have been  systematically analyzed and a statistical method has been proposed for  discriminating outer membrane proteins.

Our program takes the amino acid sequence as input and  displays the type of the protein along with membrane-spanning beta-strand  segments as a stretch of highlighted amino acid residues. Further, the  probability of residues to be in transmembrane beta-strand has been provided  with a coloring scheme.

The accuracy of the ANN-based method improved significantly,  from 70.4% to 80.5%, when evolutionary information was added to a single  sequence as a multiple sequence alignment obtained from PSI-BLAST. We have also  developed an SVM-based method using a primary sequence as input and achieved an  accuracy of 77.4%.

To gain insight into how well AlphaFold2  structures represent the conformation of proteins in solution, I here compare  the AlphaFold2 structures of selected small proteins with their 3D structures  that were determined by nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) spectroscopy. Proteins  were selected for which the 3D solution structures were determined on the basis  of a very large number of distance restraints and residual dipolar couplings and  are thus some of the best-resolved solution structures of proteins to date. The  quality of the backbone conformation of the AlphaFold2 structures is assessed by  fitting a large set of experimental residual dipolar couplings (RDCs). The  analysis shows that experimental RDCs fit extremely well to the AlphaFold2  structures predicted for GB3, DinI, and ubiquitin. In the case of GB3, the  accuracy of the AlphaFold2 structure even surpasses that of a 1.1\xa0Å crystal  structure. Fitting of experimental RDCs furthermore allows identification of  AlphaFold2 structures that are best representative of the protein's conformation  in solution as seen for the EF hands of the N-terminal domain of Ca2+ -ligated  calmodulin. Taken together, the analysis shows that structures predicted by  AlphaFold2 can be highly representative of the solution conformation of  proteins. The combination of AlphaFold2 structures with RDCs promises to be a  powerful approach to study structural changes in proteins."", 'MOTIVATION: Intrinsically disordered regions of proteins play an essential role  in the regulation of various biological processes. Key to their regulatory  function is often the binding to globular protein domains via sequence elements  known as molecular recognition features (MoRFs). Development of computational  tools for the identification of candidate MoRF locations in amino acid sequences  is an important task and an area of growing interest. Given the relative  sparseness of MoRFs in protein sequences, the accuracy of the available MoRF  predictors is often inadequate for practical usage, which leaves a significant  need and room for improvement. In this work, we introduce MoRFCHiBi_Web, which  predicts MoRF locations in protein sequences with higher accuracy compared to  current MoRF predictors. METHODS: Three distinct and largely independent property scores are computed  with component predictors and then combined to generate the final MoRF  propensity scores. The first score reflects the likelihood of sequence windows  to harbour MoRFs and is based on amino acid composition and sequence similarity  information. It is generated by MoRFCHiBi using small windows of up to 40  residues in size. The second score identifies long stretches of protein disorder  and is generated by ESpritz with the DisProt option. Lastly, the third score  reflects residue conservation and is assembled from PSSM files generated by  PSI-BLAST. These propensity scores are processed and then hierarchically  combined using Bayes rule to generate the final MoRFCHiBi_Web predictions. RESULTS: MoRFCHiBi_Web was tested on three datasets. Results show that  MoRFCHiBi_Web outperforms previously developed predictors by generating less  than half the false positive rate for the same true positive rate at practical  threshold values. This level of accuracy paired with its relatively high  processing speed makes MoRFCHiBi_Web a practical tool for MoRF prediction. AVAILABILITY: http://morf.chibi.ubc.ca:8080/morf/.']","Yes. Tools such as Jpred, Jnet, Porter 4.0 and PSIPRED Workbench have been developed that predict protein structure based solely on its amino acid sequence, whereas the recently updated Jnet algorithm provides a three-state (alpha-helix, beta-strand and coil) prediction of secondary structure at an accuracy of 81.5%."
138,Which virus type causes Molluscum contagiosum?,"['Molluscum contagiosum virus is a human and animal dermatotropic pathogen, which  causes a severe disease in immunocompromised individuals. MCV belongs to the  Poxviridae family whose members exert immunomodulatory effects on the host  antiviral response. Poxviruses interfere with cell signaling pathways that lead  to the activation of nuclear factor кB, a pleiotropic transcription factor which  is crucial for regulation of the immune response, the cell cycle and apoptosis.  In resting cells, NF-κB is present in the cytoplasm, where it is associated with  inhibitor κB. Upon stimulation by activators, such as proinflammatory cytokines  and bacterial or viral products, the inhibitory protein undergoes  phosphorylation and proteasomal degradation. NF-κB, in turn, translocates to the  nucleus, where it regulates the transcription of various genes that are  essential for processes mentioned above. Since poxviruses replicate exclusively  in the cell cytoplasm, NF-кB became a good target for poxviral immunomodulation.  MCV encodes various proteins which interfere with the signaling pathways that  lead to the activation of NF-κB. Ligand inhibitor encoded by MCV, MC54, binds  interleukin-18 and inhibits interferon-γ production. Other MCV proteins, MC159  and MC160, belong to intracellular inhibitors of NF-κB and are members of viral  FLICE-inhibitory proteins (vFLIPs). MC159 protein encoded by MCV was shown to  inhibit apoptosis of virus-infected cells. Such interactions serve immune  evasion and are responsible for the persistence of MCV.', 'Molluscum contagiosum virus (MCV) is a poxvirus that causes localized papules in  healthy persons. We evaluated a woman with severe immunodeficiency and  disseminated MCV. During treatment with CMX-001, an antiviral with activity  against other poxviruses, MCV DNA was detected in 20% of plasma samples. When  the patient was not receiving CMX-001, MCV DNA was detected in 50% of samples.  We also noted improvement in warts on her fingers during CMX-001 therapy.  Although MCV is caused by direct inoculation of virus into skin in healthy  persons, in a severely immunocompromised person MCV DNA was present in blood and  may spread by viremia.', 'Molluscum contagiosum (MC) is a very common benign self-limiting cutaneous viral  infection caused by molluscum contagiosum virus. Disease is self-limiting in  immunocompetent individuals, while it is severe and prolonged when associated  with Human Immunodeficiency Virus (HIV) infection. The widespread and refractory  mollusca of HIV disease occur especially on the face. In advanced stages of  immunosuppression, giant or verrucous forms of MC may occur. Molluscum  contagiosum tends to take a chronic course and is usually not responsive to  various treatments in immunocompromised patients. Here, we present a HIV  positive male patient with extensive papulonodular lesions over face, neck,  bilateral upper limbs since 2 months, diagnosed as giant molluscum contagiosum,  treated with cryotherapy with little improvement for few weeks after which  patient did not turn up.', 'INTRODUCTION: Molluscum contagiosum is a common superficial skin infection  caused by the poxvirus, Molluscum Contagiosum virus. The study objective is to  obtain a better understanding of physician practices and experiences with  molluscum contagiosum in order to focus informational and guidance material. METHODS: A cross-sectional survey to assess medical practitioners\' knowledge and  practices with molluscum contagiosum was conducted using the 2009 DocStyles  survey. Questions regarding category and number of molluscum contagiosum  patients seen, treatments used and advice given to patients were included in the  survey. RESULTS: Dermatologists saw the most cases, with the majority seeing 51-100  molluscum contagiosum cases/year. The most common cases seen were children with  multiple lesions and adults with genital lesions. Respondents were most likely  to recommend treatment to immunocompromised individuals, HIV patients, adults  with genital lesions and children with multiple lesions. Cryotherapy was the top  choice for all specialties with the exception of OB/GYNs, whose top choice was  curettage. ""Avoid intimate contact until lesions resolve"", ""Avoid touching  lesions to reduce further spread"", and ""Don\'t be concerned, this will go away""  were the top advice choices. DISCUSSION: Most survey respondents have dealt with molluscum contagiosum in  their practice during the previous year. Overall, respondents picked appropriate  choices for treatment and advice given; however some ineffective or unnecessary  treatments were chosen and recommendations to prevent spread were chosen  infrequently. Knowledge gaps for appropriate transmission precaution advice  might cause unnecessary spread or autoinoculation. This survey has demonstrated  that molluscum contagiosum is a common infection seen by many types of  practitioners and therefore guidance on treatment considerations and infection  control is valuable.', 'Molluscum contagiosum virus (MCV) is a poxvirus that causes tumor-like skin  lesions. New evidence indicates that plasmacytoid dendritic cells, type I  interferon production, and interferon-induced dendritic cells have prominent  roles in anti-MCV responses, and these features characterize the inflammatory  response in lesions that will likely undergo spontaneous regression.', 'Molluscum contagiosum virus (MCV) is a common, human poxvirus that causes small  papular skin lesions that persist for long periods without signs of  inflammation. Previous studies revealed that MCV encodes a family of proteins  with homology to mammalian IL-18 binding proteins. IL-18 is a proinflammatory  cytokine that induces synthesis of interferon gamma, activates NK cells, and is  required for a T-lymphocyte helper type 1 response. We expressed and purified  the proteins encoded by the MC53L and MC54L genes of MCV, as well as their human  and murine homologs. All four recombinant proteins were able to bind with high  affinity to human and murine IL-18 molecules and inhibited IL-18 mediated  interferon gamma production in a dose-dependent manner. The pirating of IL-18  binding proteins by poxviruses and their use as decoy receptors is consistent  with the critical role of IL-18 in defense against virus infections and provides  a mechanism for evasion of the immune system by MCV.', 'Molluscum contagiosum virus (MCV), a poxvirus pathogenic for humans, replicates  well in human skin in vivo, but not in vitro in standard monolayer cell  cultures. In order to determine the nature of the replication deficiency in  vitro, the MCV infection process in standard culture has to be studied step by  step. The method described in this chapter uses luciferase and GFP reporter  constructs to measure poxviral mRNA transcription activity in cells in standard  culture infected with known quantities of MCV or vaccinia virus. Briefly, MCV  isolated from human tissue specimen is quantitated by PCR and used to infect  human HEK293 cells, selected for ease of transfection. The cells are  subsequently transfected with a reporter plasmid encoding firefly luciferase  gene under the control of a synthetic early/late poxviral promoter and a control  plasmid encoding a renilla luciferase reporter under the control of a eukaryotic  promoter. After 16 h, cells are harvested and tested for expression of  luciferase. MCV genome units are quantitated by PCR targeting a genome area  conserved between MCV and vaccinia virus. Using a GFP reporter plasmid, this  method can be further used to infect a series of epithelial and fibroblast-type  cell lines of human and animal origin to microscopically visualize MCV-infected  cells, to assess late promoter activation, and, using these parameters, to  optimize MCV infectivity and gene expression in more complex eukaryotic cell  culture models.', 'BACKGROUND AND AIMS: Molluscum contagiosum is caused by the molluscum  contagiosum virus (MCV) and is a very common skin disorder mainly involving  young children Cryotherapy, curettage or some topical therapies have been  applied for MC, but all of these treatments need several sessions, can be  somewhat ineffective, and very painful. The present study assessed the impact of  a single session of pulsed dye laser treatment of MC lesions which had proved  resistant to other approaches Subjects and methods: Fifteen children comprised  the study subjects, 11 boys and 4 girls, 3-5 years of age (mean 4.2 yr) with  recalcitrant MC. Lesions were counted at baseline, and a single shot from a 585  nm pulsed dye laser was applied to each lesion (3 mm, 300 ms, 8.0 J/cm(2)).  Lesions were counted again at 1 week post-treatment and followed for up to 3  months thereafter. RESULTS: All patients completed the study and no patient dropped out through  pain or discomfort. Purpura was seen at each treated lesion immediately after  irradiation, but at 1 week after treatment, lesion clearance was virtually  complete which was maintained for 1 month, and no recurrence was seen at 3  months in 8 of the 15 patients who remained available for followup. CONCLUSIONS: A single treatment of MC lesions with the pulsed dye laser  successfully cured even recalcitrant lesions with no recurrence on follow up,  and was well tolerated by the young subjects.', 'Molluscum contagiosum virus is a human and animal dermatotropic pathogen, which  causes a severe disease in immunocompromised individuals.

Its ability to persist likely is due to its arsenal of  viral immunoevasion proteins. For example, the MCV MC159 protein inhibits  TNF-R1-induced NF-κB activation and apoptosis. The MC159 protein is a viral FLIP  and, as such, possesses two tandem death effector domains (DEDs). We show in  this article that, in human embryonic kidney 293 T cells, the expression of  wild-type MC159 or a mutant MC159 protein containing the first DED (MC159 A)  inhibited TNF-induced NF-κB, or NF-κB activated by PMA or MyD88 overexpression,  whereas a mutant protein lacking the first DED (MC159 B) did not. We  hypothesized that the MC159 protein targeted the IκB kinase (IKK) complex to  inhibit these diverse signaling events. Indeed, the MC159 protein, but not MC159  B, coimmunoprecipitated with IKKγ. MC159 coimmunoprecipitated with IKKγ when  using mouse embryonic fibroblasts that lack either IKKα or IKKβ, suggesting that  the MC159 protein interacted directly with IKKγ. MC159-IKKγ  coimmunoprecipitations were detected during infection of cells with either MCV  isolated from human lesions or with a recombinant MC159-expressing vaccinia  virus. MC159 also interacts with TRAF2, a signaling molecule involved in NF-κB  activation. However, mutational analysis of MC159 failed to reveal a correlation  between MC159-TRAF2 interactions and MC159's inhibitory function. We propose  that MC159-IKK interactions, but not MC159-TRAF2 interactions, are responsible  for inhibiting NF-κB activation.""]",Molluscum contagiosum virus (MCV) is a human poxvirus that causes tumor-like skin lesions.
139,Is the Miller-Fisher syndrome considered to be a variant of Guillain-Barré?,"['A large body of clinical and experimental data indicate that complement  activation is an important mechanism for neuronal and glial injury in  Guillain-Barré syndromes. Inhibition of complement activation therefore might be  expected to limit the progression of the disease. Using in vitro and in vivo  models of the Guillain-Barré syndrome variant, Miller Fisher syndrome, we have  shown previously that anti-GQ1b ganglioside antibodies target the presynaptic  motor nerve terminal axon and surrounding perisynaptic Schwann cells, thereby  mediating destructive injury through deposition of membrane attack complex.  Here, we have used this model to investigate the effects of a novel therapeutic  inhibitor of complement activation, APT070 (Mirococept), both in vitro and in  vivo. In these models, APT070 completely prevents membrane attack complex  formation, and thereby has a major neuroprotective effect at the nerve terminal,  as assessed by immunohistology of perisynaptic Schwann cell and axonal  integrity. These data provide a rationale for considering clinical trials of  APT070 in Guillain-Barré syndrome, its variant forms, and other complement  dependent neuromuscular disorders.', 'Miller Fisher Syndrome (MFS), which is characterized by ophthalmoplegia, ataxia  and tendon areflexia, is generally considered as a clinical variant of  Guillain-Barré Syndrome. However some features of the disease are still debated,  particularly regarding possible central nervous system involvement. After  presenting two new cases of MFS, the authors provide a critical review of the  literature and discuss the nosographical position of the disease. The main  conclusions can be summarized as follows: MFS is a predominantly axonal  inflammatory neuropathy with prevailing involvement of oculomotor nerves. It is  associated to spinal multi or polyneuropathy, which in mildly affected cases is  manifested by areflexia, while in severe ones it can be responsible of sense  and/or motor impairment. In addition to peripheral neuropathy CNS involvement,  exclusive or more marked in posterior fossa, occurs not infrequently. The  prognosis of the disease is often benign, but disabling or even fatal outcome is  possible. Corticosteroid treatment, possibly because of antiinflammatory and/or  immunosuppressive action, could be effective in some patients. Finally, in spite  of some similarities with GBS, MFS should be considered as a separate entity  with its own nosographical position.', 'OBJECTIVES: To estimate the incidence rate of Guillain-Barré syndrome variants  in an unselected population and to describe their clinical features and  prognosis. METHODS: A two year prospective multicentre study on the incidence and prognosis  of Guillain-Barré syndrome was performed in Emilia-Romagna, northern Italy  (3,909,512 inhabitants). A surveillance system was instituted within the study  area, which comprised all the neurological departments, private and public  general hospitals, and practising neurologists. The international classification  of diseases (ICD) codes 357.XX (any peripheral neuropathy) of hospital  discharges were also reviewed. RESULTS: Data were separately analysed for Miller Fisher syndrome and other  Guillain-Barré syndrome variants. During the study period 18 patients with  Guillain-Barré syndrome variants including seven with Miller Fisher syndrome  were recruited; the incidence rates were 0.14/100000/year (95% confidence  interval (95% CI) 0.07-0.25) for Guillain-Barré syndrome variants (excluding  Miller Fisher syndrome) and 0.09/100000/year (95% CI 0.04-0.18) for Miller  Fisher syndrome. Guillain-Barré syndrome variants alone (excluding Miller Fisher  syndrome) accounted for 10.5% of total cases. Death and relapses were not found.  Details of clinical, electrophysiological, and CSF findings of Guillain-Barré  syndrome variants are provided. CONCLUSIONS: Guillain-Barré syndrome variants other than Miller Fisher syndrome,  as obtained through a population based study, account for about 10% of total  cases of Guillain-Barré syndrome and, as a whole, have a good prognosis. Their  clinical features are heterogeneous; bifacial weakness (associated with other  signs, mainly sensory disturbances) represents the most frequent finding.', 'BACKGROUND: Miller-Fisher syndrome is characterised by the clinical triad of  ophthalmoplegia, ataxia and areflexia and is considered a variant form of  Guillain-Barré syndrome. In western countries the incidence is reported to be  approximately 1-5% that of Guillain-Barré syndrome. Approximately 90% of  patients have antibodies against the ganglioside GQ1b, which is of diagnostic  and pathogenic importance. MATERIAL AND METHODS: We present two patients with Miller-Fisher syndrome and  describe clinical features and possible mechanisms of GQ1b antibodies. RESULTS AND INTERPRETATION: Both patients presented with the classical triad of  symptoms and GQ1b antibodies after upper respiratory tract infections. One of  the patients had a more severe form with additional bulbar signs and was treated  with plasma exchange. Both made almost complete recoveries within a few months.', 'A recent report described serum anti-GQ1b ganglioside antibodies in Miller  Fisher syndrome (MFS), a clinical variant of Guillain-Barré syndrome (GBS). Four  consecutive cases of MFS all had high titre anti-GQ1b antibodies which were  absent from all control sera including those of patients with GBS.', ""PURPOSE OF REVIEW: Miller Fisher syndrome is a localized variant of  Guillain-Barré syndrome, characterized by ophthalmoplegia, areflexia and ataxia.  Bickerstaff's brainstem encephalitis is a related syndrome in which upper motor  neurone features accompany the classic triad. Anti-GQ1b antibodies are uniquely  found in both conditions and are believed to be pathogenic. RECENT FINDINGS: Infectious illnesses usually precede Miller Fisher syndrome.  The clearest associations have been described with Haemophilus influenzae and  Campylobacter jejuni infection. Raised cerebrospinal fluid protein is seen in  60% of patients, but clinical features and anti-GQ1b antibody testing are  diagnostically more informative. Experimental studies demonstrating  complement-dependent neuromuscular block may be relevant to the clinical  pathophysiology of Miller Fisher syndrome. Recent neurophysiological studies  suggest abnormal neuromuscular transmission occurs in some cases of Miller  Fisher syndrome and Guillain-Barré syndrome. Recent mouse models have  demonstrated that presynaptic neuronal membranes and perisynaptic Schwann cells  are targets for anti-GQ1b antibody attack. The elimination of antiganglioside  antibodies from the circulation through specific immunoadsorption therapy has  the potential to ameliorate the course of Miller Fisher syndrome. This condition  is typically a benign, self-limiting illness. Both plasmapheresis and  intravenous immunoglobulin may be employed as treatment, especially in cases of  Bickerstaff's brainstem encephalitis or those with overlapping Guillain-Barré  syndrome. SUMMARY: Anti-GQ1b antibody testing has allowed clinicians to develop a greater  understanding of the spectrum of Miller Fisher syndromes and to refine clinical  diagnoses in patients with unusual presentations. Experimental studies strongly  suggest anti-GQ1b antibodies are pathogenic, which in principle should direct  treatments towards antibody neutralization or elimination."", 'BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVE: Miller-Fisher syndrome (MFS) is considered the most  common variant of Guillain-Barré syndrome (GBS) and is characterized by the  clinical triad of ophthalmoplegia, ataxia and areflexia. Respiratory involvement  and relapses are unusual. Patients with MFS usually have a good recovery and no  residual deficits. We describe the clinical features, associated infections and  evolution in eight patients with MFS. PATIENTS AND METHOD: Eight cases of MFS and sixty-one of GBS were studied  between 1994 and 2003. All cases showed the clinical triad of MFS without major  limb weakness or other signs suggestive of CNS involvement. RESULTS: The proportion of MFS with respect to GBS during the same period was  13.1%. Four had a positive serology for Epstein-Barr virus, Salmonella  enteritidis, Chlamydia pneumoniae and Mycoplasma pneumoniae. Our cases showed  facial palsy (75%), dysphagia (75%), pupillary abnormalities (37.5%) and  ventilation support (37.5%). Antiganglioside antibodies, determined in three  cases (4 episodes), were positive [GQ1b (50%) and GD1b (50%)]. In all cases,  there was a markedly reduced amplitude of the distal sensory as well as frequent  axonal degeneration signs. The oldest three patients relapsed and required  ventilation support. CONCLUSIONS: We report for the first time an association between S. enteritidis  and C. pneumoniae and MFS. Older patients in our series suffered a faster  disease progression with need of ventilation support. We conclude that an older  age correlates with poor prognosis and relapses.', 'Systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) is an autoimmune systemic disease with  multiple organ involvement with high morbidity and mortality rate.

We are reporting a rare case of  Miller-Fisher (MFS) variant of Guillain-Barré syndrome (GBS) as the first  manifestation of SLE in a 41-year-old female who progressed to flaccid paralysis  with no neurological improvement with initial immunosuppressive therapy,  plasmapheresis, and first cycle of intravenous immunoglobulin (IVIG) but with  remarkable and complete recovery after the second 5-day course of IVIG.', 'Some patients developed Guillain-Barré syndrome after the administration of  bovine brain ganglioside. Patients with Guillain-Barré syndrome subsequent to  Campylobacter jejuni enteritis frequently have IgG antibody to GM1 ganglioside.  Miller Fisher syndrome, a variant of Guillain-Barré syndrome, is associated with  IgG antibody to GQ1b ganglioside. My colleagues and I showed the existence of  molecular mimicry between GM1 and lipopolysaccharide of C. jejuni isolated from  a patient with Guillain-Barré syndrome, and that between GQ1b and C. jejuni  lipopolysaccharides from patients with Miller Fisher syndrome. The glycotope  mimicry between infectious agents and gangliosides may function in the  production of antiganglioside antibodies and the development of Guillain-Barré  syndrome and Miller Fisher syndrome.', 'A recent report described serum anti-GQ1b ganglioside antibodies in Miller  Fisher syndrome (MFS), a clinical variant of Guillain-Barré syndrome (GBS).

140,Have mutations in the ZEB2 gene been found in any human syndrome?,"['Mowat-Wilson syndrome (MWS) is a recently delineated mental retardation  (MR)-multiple congenital anomaly syndrome, characterized by typical facies,  severe MR, epilepsy, and variable congenital malformations, including  Hirschsprung disease (HSCR), genital anomalies, congenital heart disease (CHD),  and agenesis of the corpus callosum (ACC). It is caused by de novo heterozygous  mutations or deletions of the ZFHX1B gene located at 2q22. ZFHX1B encodes  Smad-interacting protein-1 (SMADIP1 or SIP1), a transcriptional corepressor  involved in the transforming growth factor-beta signaling pathway. It is a  highly evolutionarily conserved gene, widely expressed in embryological  development. Over 100 mutations have been described in patients with clinically  typical MWS, who almost always have whole gene deletions or truncating mutations  (nonsense or frameshift) of ZFHX1B, suggesting that haploinsufficiency is the  basis of MWS pathology. No obvious genotype-phenotype correlation could be  identified so far, but atypical phenotypes have been reported with missense or  splice mutations in the ZFHX1B gene. In this work we describe 40 novel mutations  and we summarize the various mutational reports published since the  identification of the causative gene.', 'Mammalian pallial (cortical and hippocampal) and striatal interneurons are both  generated in the embryonic subpallium, including the medial ganglionic eminence  (MGE). Herein we demonstrate that the Zfhx1b (Sip1, Zeb2) zinc finger homeobox  gene is required in the MGE, directly downstream of Dlx1&2, to generate cortical  interneurons that express Cxcr7, MafB, and cMaf. In its absence, Nkx2-1  expression is not repressed, and cells that ordinarily would become cortical  interneurons appear to transform toward a subtype of GABAergic striatal  interneurons. These results show that Zfhx1b is required to generate cortical  interneurons, and suggest a mechanism for the epilepsy observed in humans with  Zfhx1b mutations (Mowat-Wilson syndrome).', 'Mowat-Wilson syndrome (OMIM 235730) is a genetic condition characterized by  moderate-to-severe intellectual disability, a recognizable facial phenotype, and  multiple congenital anomalies. The striking facial phenotype in addition to  other features such as severely impaired speech, hypotonia, microcephaly, short  stature, seizures, corpus callosum agenesis, congenital heart defects,  hypospadias, and Hirschsprung disease are particularly important clues for the  initial clinical diagnosis. All molecularly confirmed cases with typical MWS  have a heterozygous loss-of-function mutation in the zinc finger E-box protein 2  (ZEB2) gene, also called SIP1 (Smad-interacting protein 1) and ZFHX1B,  suggesting that haploinsufficiency is the main pathological mechanism.  Approximately 80% of mutations are nonsense and frameshift mutations (small  insertions or deletions). About half of these mutations are located in exon  eight. Here, we report the first Indonesian patient with Mowat-Wilson syndrome  confirmed by molecular analysis.', 'Rubinstein-Taybi syndrome (RSTS) is a rare autosomal dominant disorder  characterised by facial dysmorphisms, growth and psychomotor development delay,  and skeletal defects. The known genetic causes are point mutations or deletions  of the CREBBP (50-60%) and EP300 (5%) genes. To detect chromosomal  rearrangements indicating novel positional candidate RSTS genes, we used a-CGH  to study 26 patients fulfilling the diagnostic criteria for RSTS who were  negative at fluorescence in situ hybridisation analyses of the CREBBP and EP300  regions, and direct sequencing analyses of the CREBBP gene. We found seven  imbalances (27%): four de novo and three inherited rearrangements not reported  among the copy number variants. A de novo 7p21.1 deletion of 500 kb included the  TWIST1 gene, a suggested candidate for RSTS that is responsible for the  Saethre-Chotzen syndrome, an entity that enters in differential diagnosis with  RSTS. A similar issue of differential diagnosis was raised by a large 4.3 Mb  2q22.3q23.1 deletion encompassing ZEB2, the gene responsible for the  Mowat-Wilson syndrome, whose signs may overlap with RSTS. Positional candidate  genes could not be sought in the remaining pathogenetic imbalances, because of  the size of the involved region (a 9 Mb 2q24.3q31.1 deletion) and/or the  relative paucity of suitable genes (a 5 Mb 3p13p12.3 duplication). One of the  inherited rearrangements, the 17q11.2 379Kb duplication, represents the  reciprocal event of the deletion underlying an overgrowth syndrome, both being  mediated by the NF1-REP-P1 and REP-P2 sub-duplicons. The contribution of this  and the other detected CNVs to the clinical RSTS phenotype is difficult to  assess.', 'Mowat-Wilson syndrome (MWS) is an autosomal dominant intellectual disability  syndrome characterised by unique facial features and congenital anomalies such  as Hirschsprung disease, congenital heart defects, corpus callosum agenesis and  urinary tract anomalies. Some cases also present epilepsy, growth retardation  and microcephaly. The syndrome is caused by mutations or deletions of the ZEB2  gene at chromosome 2q22-q23. MWS was first described in 1998 and until now  approximately 180 cases have been reported worldwide. We report the first three  molecularly confirmed Danish cases with MWS.', 'Mowat-Wilson syndrome (OMIM 235730) is a genetic condition characterized by  moderate-to-severe intellectual disability, a recognizable facial phenotype, and  multiple congenital anomalies.

KOS is a rare, possibly underestimated condition, with  fewer than 10 cases reported to date. Here we investigate the molecular cause  underlying KOS. METHODS: An exome sequencing approach was used on a single affected individual  of an Italian consanguineous family coupled with mutation scanning using Sanger  sequencing on a second unrelated subject with clinical features fitting the  disorder. RESULTS: Exome sequencing was able to identify homozygosity for a novel  truncating mutation (c.556C>T, p.Arg186stop) in UBE3B, which encodes a widely  expressed HECT (homologous to the E6-AP carboxyl terminus) domain E3  ubiquitin-protein ligase. Homozygosity for a different nonsense lesion affecting  the gene (c.1166G>A, p.Trp389stop) was documented in the second affected  subject, supporting the recessive mode of inheritance of the disorder. Mutation  scanning of the entire UBE3B coding sequence on a selected cohort of subjects  with features overlapping, in part, those recurring in KOS did not reveal  disease-causing mutations, suggesting phenotypic homogeneity of UBE3B lesions. DISCUSSION: Our data provide evidence that KOS is caused by UBE3B loss of  function, and further demonstrate the impact of misregulation of protein  ubiquitination on development and growth. The available clinical records,  including those referring to four UBE3B mutation-positive subjects recently  described as belonging to a previously unreported entity, which fits KOS,  document the clinical homogeneity of this disorder.', ""Bardet-Biedl syndrome (BBS) is an autosomal recessive disorder with locus  heterogeneity.

McKusick-Kaufma syndrome (MKS) includes hydrometrocolpos, postaxial  polydactyly and congenital heart disease, and is also inherited in an autosomal  recessive manner. We ascertained 34 unrelated probands with classic features of  BBS including retinitis pigmentosa (RP), obesity and polydactyly. The probands  were from families unsuitable for linkage because of family size. We found MKKS  mutations in four typical BBS probands (Table 1). The first is a 13-year-old  Hispanic girl with severe RP, PAP, mental retardation and obesity (BMI >40). She  was a compound heterozygote for a missense (1042GA, G52D) and a nonsense  (1679TA, Y264stop) mutation in exon 3. Cloning and sequencing of the separate  alleles confirmed that the mutations were present in trans. A second BBS proband  (from Newfoundland), born to consanguineous parents, was homozygous for two  deletions (1316delC and 1324-1326delGTA) in exon 3, predicting a frameshift. An  affected brother was also homozygous for the deletions, whereas an unaffected  sibling had two normal copies of MKKS. Both the proband and her affected brother  had RP, PAP, mild mental retardation, morbid obesity (BMI >50 and 37,  respectively), lobulated kidneys with prominent calyces and diabetes mellitus  (diagnosed at ages 33 and 30, respectively). A deceased sister (DNA unavailable)  had similar phenotypic features (RP with blindness by age 13, BMI >45, abnormal  glucose tolerance test and IQ=64, vaginal atresia and syndactyly of both feet).  Both parents and the maternal grandfather were heterozygous for the deletions.  Genotyping with markers from the MKKS region confirmed homozygosity at 20p12 in  both affected individuals."", 'Roberts syndrome and SC phocomelia syndrome are rare autosomal recessive genetic  disorders representing the extremes of the spectrum of severity of the same  condition, caused by mutations in ESCO2 gene.

Patients were  subjected to clinical, cytogenetic and radiologic examinations. Cytogenetic  analysis showed the characteristic premature separation of centromeres and  puffing of heterochromatic regions. Further, sequencing of the ESCO2 gene  identified a novel mutation c.244_245dupCT (p.T83Pfs*20) in one family besides  two previously reported mutations c.760_761insA (p.T254Nfs*27) and  c.764_765delTT (p.F255Cfs*25). All mutations were in homozygous state, in exon  3. The severity of the mesomelic shortening of the limbs and craniofacial  anomalies showed variability among patients. Interestingly, patient 1 had  abnormal skin hypopigmentation. Serial fetal ultrasound examinations and  measurements of long bones diagnosed two affected fetuses in two of the studied  families.

141,What is the correlation between SPARC expression and growth inhibition in human cancer?,"['Hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) is the sixth most common cancer and the third  leading cause of cancer-related death worldwide. Current treatments are  extremely disappointing. SPARC (Secreted protein, acidic and rich in cysteine)  is a matricellular glycoprotein with differential expression in several tumors,  including HCC, which significance remains unclear. We infected HCC cells (HepG2,  Hep3B and Huh7) with an adenovirus expressing SPARC (AdsSPARC) to examine the  role of SPARC expression on HCC cells and its effect on tumor aggressiveness.  The in vitro HCC cells substrate-dependent proliferation and cell cycle profile  were unaffected; however, SPARC overexpression reduced HCC proliferation when  cells were grown in spheroids. A mild induction of cellular apoptosis was  observed upon SPARC overexpression. SPARC overexpression resulted in spheroid  growth inhibition in vitro while no effects were found when recombinant SPARC  was exogenously applied. Moreover, the clonogenic and migratory capabilities  were largely decreased in SPARC-overexpressing HCC cells, altogether suggesting  a less aggressive HCC cell phenotype. Consistently, AdsSPARC-transduced cells  showed increased E-cadherin expression and a concomitant decrease in N-cadherin  expression. Furthermore, SPARC overexpression was found to reduce HCC cell  viability in response to 5-FU-based chemotherapy in vitro, partially through  induction of apoptosis. In vivo experiments revealed that SPARC overexpression  in HCC cells inhibited their tumorigenic capacity and increased animal survival  through a mechanism that partially involves host macrophages. Our data suggest  that SPARC overexpression in HCC cells results in a reduced tumorigenicity  partially through the induction of mesenchymal-to-epithelial transition (MET).  These evidences point to SPARC as a novel target for HCC treatment.', 'Secreted protein, acidic and rich in cysteine (SPARC), is a matricellular  glycoprotein with growth-inhibitory and antiangiogenic functions. Although SPARC  has been implicated as a tumor suppressor in humans, its function in normal or  malignant hematopoiesis has not previously been studied. We found that the  leukemic cells of AML patients with MLL gene rearrangements express low to  undetectable amounts of SPARC whereas normal hematopoietic progenitors and most  AML patients express this gene. SPARC RNA and protein levels were also low or  undetectable in AML cell lines with MLL translocations. Consistent with its  tumor suppressive effects in various solid tumor models, exogenous SPARC protein  selectively reduced the growth of cell lines with MLL rearrangements by  inhibiting cell cycle progression from G1 to S phase. The lack of SPARC  expression in MLL-rearranged cell lines was associated with dense promoter  methylation. However, we found no evidence of methylation-based silencing of  SPARC in primary patient samples. Our results suggest that low or absent SPARC  expression is a consistent feature of AML cells with MLL rearrangements and that  SPARC may function as a tumor suppressor in this subset of patients. A potential  role of exogenous SPARC in the therapy of MLL-rearranged AML warrants further  investigation.', 'Secreted protein acidic and rich in cysteine (SPARC) is highly expressed in  human astrocytomas, grades II-IV. We demonstrated previously that SPARC promotes  invasion in vitro using the U87MG-derived clone U87T2 and U87T2-derived  SPARC-transfected clones, A2b2, A2bi, and C2a4, in the spheroid confrontation  assay. Additional in vitro studies demonstrated that SPARC delays growth,  increases attachment, and modulates migration of tumor cells in extracellular  matrix-specific and concentration-dependent manners. Therefore, we propose that  SPARC functionally contributes to brain tumor invasion and delays tumor growth  in vivo, and that the effects of SPARC are related to the level of SPARC  secreted into the extracellular matrix. To test these hypotheses, we  stereotactically injected these clones into nude rat brains (six animals were  injected per clone). Animals were sacrificed on day 7 to assess growth and  invasion for all clones at the same time in tumor development. To determine  whether SPARC delayed but did not inhibit growth, rats were injected with U87T2  or clone A2b2, and the animals were sacrificed on days 9 (U87T2) and 20 (A2b2),  when the animals demonstrated neurological deficit. Brains were removed, fixed,  photographed, paraffin embedded, and sectioned. Sections were then serially  stained with H&E for morphological assessment of invasion and to measure tumor  volume, immunohistochemically stained to visualize SPARC, subjected to in situ  hybridization with the human AluII DNA-binding probe to identify human cells,  and immunohistochemically stained with MIB-1 to measure proliferation index. The  results demonstrate that SPARC promotes invasion in vivo at day 7. Both the low  (A2bi) and the high (A2b2) SPARC-secreting clones produced invasive tumors,  invading with fingerlike projections and satellite masses into adjacent brain,  as well as along the corpus collosum. The intermediate SPARC secreting clone  (C2a4) primarily migrated as a bulk tumor along the corpus collosum. SPARC  significantly decreased tumor growth at day 7, as measured both by adjusted  MIB-1 proliferation indices (U87T2 = 95.3 +/- 1.4 versus A2bi = 73.4 +/- 4.0,  A2b2 = 30.8 +/- 6.7 and C2a4 = 15.7 +/- 13.0) and tumor volumes (U87T2 = 13.4  +/- 0.6 mm(3) versus A2bi = 4.5 +/- 0.6 mm(3), A2b2 = 1.1 +/- 0.1 mm(3), and  C2a4 = 0.4 +/- 0.1 mm(3)). Furthermore, SPARC delayed but did not inhibit tumor  growth. The patterns of invasion and the extent of growth delay correlated with  the level of SPARC expression. We propose that the ability of SPARC to promote  invasion depends on the level of its secretion and the resultant modulation of  the level of adherence and motility induced. This demonstration that SPARC  functionally contributes to brain tumor invasion in vivo suggests that SPARC is  a candidate therapeutic target for the design of therapies directed toward  inhibition of the invasive phenotype.', 'Epigenetic aberrations and a CpG island methylator phenotype are associated with  poor outcome in children with neuroblastoma (NB). Previously, we have shown that  valproic acid (VPA), a histone deacetylase (HDAC) inhibitor, exerts antitumor  effects in an NB xenograft model. However, the underlying antitumor molecular  mechanisms are largely unknown. In this study, we examined the role of HDAC in  cell proliferation, cell cycle progression, gene expression patterns, and  epigenome in NB. Cell proliferation, cell cycle progression, caspase activity,  RNA and protein expression, quantitative methylation, and global DNA methylation  were examined in NBL-W-N and LA1-55n NB cell lines. Our studies showed that  inhibition of HDAC decreased NB proliferation, and induced caspase activity and  G1 growth arrest. Expression patterns of cancer-related genes were modulated by  VPA. The expression of THBS1, CASP8, SPARC, CDKN1A, HIC1, CDKN1B, and HIN1 was  upregulated, and that of MYCN and TIG1 was downregulated. HDAC inhibition  decreased methylation levels of THBS1 and RASSF1A promoters. Inhibition of HDAC  increased acetylation of histone 4 and overall DNA methylation levels. Our  studies showed that inhibition of HDAC blocked cell proliferation and cell cycle  progression in relation to alteration in cancer-related genes, increased overall  DNA methylation, and decreased methylation of tumor suppressor genes. Further  studies examining the antitumor effects of VPA in NB are warranted.', ""Krüppel-Like Factor 4 (KLF4) functions as a tumor suppressor in some cancers,  but its molecular mechanism is not clear. Our recent study also showed that the  expression of KLF4 is dramatically reduced in primary lung cancer tissues. To  investigate the possible role of KLF4 in lung cancer, we stably transfected KLF4  into cells from lung cancer cell lines H322 and A549 to determine the cells'  invasion ability. Our results showed that ectopic expression of KLF4 extensively  suppressed lung cancer cell invasion in Matrigel. This effect was independent of  KLF4-mediated p21 up-regulation because ectopic expression of p21 had minimal  effect on cell invasion. Our analysis of the expression of 12 genes associated  with cell invasion in parental, vector-transfected, and KLF4-transfected cells  showed that ectopic expression of KLF4 resulted in extensively repressed  expression of secreted protein acidic and rich in cysteine (SPARC), an  extracellular matrix protein that plays a role in tumor development and  metastasis. Knockdown of SPARC expression in H322 and A549 cells led to  suppression of cell invasion, comparable to that observed in KLF4-transfected  cells. Moreover, retrovirus-mediated restoration of SPARC expression in  KLF4-transfected cells abrogated KLF4-induced anti-invasion activity. Together,  our results indicate that KLF4 inhibits lung cancer cell invasion by suppressing  SPARC gene expression."", 'SPARC is an extracellular matrix protein that exerts pleiotropic effects on  extracellular matrix organization, growth factor availability, cell adhesion,  differentiation, and immunity in cancer. Chronic myelogenous leukemia (CML)  cells resistant to the BCR-ABL inhibitor imatinib (IM-R cells) were found to  overexpress SPARC mRNA. In this study, we show that imatinib triggers SPARC  accumulation in a variety of tyrosine kinase inhibitor (TKI)-resistant CML cell  lines. SPARC silencing in IM-R cells restored imatinib sensitivity, whereas  enforced SPARC expression in imatinib-sensitive cells promoted viability as well  as protection against imatinib-mediated apoptosis. Notably, we found that the  protective effect of SPARC required intracellular retention inside cells.  Accordingly, SPARC was not secreted into the culture medium of IM-R cells.  Increased SPARC expression was intimately linked to persistent activation of the  Fyn/ERK kinase signaling axis. Pharmacologic inhibition of this pathway or  siRNA-mediated knockdown of Fyn kinase resensitized IM-R cells to imatinib. In  support of our findings, increased levels of SPARC mRNA were documented in blood  cells from CML patients after 1 year of imatinib therapy compared with initial  diagnosis. Taken together, our results highlight an important role for the  Fyn/ERK signaling pathway in imatinib-resistant cells that is driven by  accumulation of intracellular SPARC.', 'Previously, we found that sperm-associated antigen 5 (SPAG5) was upregulated in  pelvic lymph node metastasis-positive cervical cancer. The aim of this study is  to examine the role of SPAG5 in the proliferation and tumorigenicity of cervical  cancer and its clinical significance in tumor progression. In our study, SPAG5  expression in cervical cancer patients was detected using quantitative real-time  polymerase chain reaction, western blotting, and immunohistochemistry; cervical  cancer cell function with downregulated SPAG5 in vitro was explored using  tetrazolium assay, flow cytometry, and colony formation and Transwell assays.  SPAG5 was upregulated in tumor tissue compared with paired adjacent noncancerous  tissues; SPAG5 upregulation in tumor tissues indicated poor disease-free  survival, which was also an independent prognostic indicator for cervical cancer  patients. In vitro study demonstrated that SPAG5 downregulation inhibited cell  proliferation and growth significantly by G2/M arrest and induction of  apoptosis, and hindered cell migration and invasion. Under SPAG5 downregulation,  the sensitivity of cervical cancer cells differed according to taxol dose, which  correlated with mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR) signaling pathway activity.  In general, SPAG5 upregulation relates to poor prognosis in cervical cancer  patients, and SPAG5 is a regulator of mTOR activity during taxol treatment in  cervical cancer.', 'We investigated whether Ukrain modulates the malignant phenotype of clear cell  renal cell carcinoma (ccRCC) cells Caki-1, Caki-2, and ACHN treated with four  doses (5, 10, 20, and 40 μmol/l) for 24 and 48 h. The epithelial-to-mesenchymal  transition markers E-cadherin, β-catenin, and vimentin were analyzed by  immunofluorescence as well as actin and tubulin; matrix metalloproteinase-2 and  matrix metalloproteinase-9 activity was analyzed by SDS-zymography,  intracellular and secreted SPARC levels by western blot, and cell cycle by flow  cytometry. Ukrain did not induce E-cadherin/β-catenin immunoreactivity at the  cell-cell boundary, although it determined the actin cortical expression in  Caki-2 and ACHN, and did not affect vimentin organization; however, in some  Caki-1 and ACHN cells the perinuclear concentration of vimentin was consistent  with its downregulation. Matrix metalloproteinase-2 and matrix  metalloproteinase-9 activity was significantly downregulated 48 h after 20  μmol/l Ukrain administration. At this time point, Ukrain significantly decreased  migration and invasion, and downregulated SPARC levels in cell supernatants at  all doses in Caki-2, and at 20 μmol/l in Caki-1 and ACHN cells. Concomitantly,  SPARC was upregulated in all ccRCC cells, suggesting that Ukrain could also  affect cell proliferation by cell cycle inhibition, as supported by the cell  cycle analysis, as SPARC also acts as a cell cycle inhibitor. Our results  suggest that Ukrain may switch the epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition-related  phenotype of ccRCC cells, and targets the two major aspects involved in RCC  progression, such as tumor invasion/microenvironment remodeling and cell  proliferation.', 'Survivin (BIRC5) is one of the members of IAP-family apoptosis inhibitors. The  BIRCS gene is expressed in most human embryonic tissues and malignant tumors but  not in normal differentiated tissues of adult human. It was suggested that BIRC5  proteins inhibit apoptosis and play an essential role in tumorigenesis, makings  surviving an attractive target for anticancer therapy. The mechanisms regulating  level of survivin are not completely understood. It was supposed that natural  inhibitors of survivin, namely SMAC and PML, play an important role in these  processes. Using RT-PCR and immunoblotting we analyzed the transcription level  of BIRC5, SMAC and PML genes and content of corresponding proteins in normal and  tumor human tissues in non-small cell lung cancer and esophageal squamous cell  carcinoma. It was demonstrated that BIRC5 is transcribed only in tumor tissues,  whereas expression levels of SMAC and PML are the same in normal and tumor  tissues. The contents of proteins correspond to levels of mRNA of the respective  genes. Thus the increase of level of survivin in tumor tissues is not the result  of decrease in content of its inhibitors SMAC and PML, as their content in tumor  and normal cells is the same.', 'SATB1 (special AT-rich binding protein 1) is a global chromatin organizer  regulating the expression of a large number of genes. Overexpression has been  found in various solid tumors and positively correlated with prognostic and  clinicopathological properties. In colorectal cancer (CRC), SATB1 overexpression  and its correlation with poor differentiation, invasive depth, TNM (tumor,  nodes, metastases) stage and prognosis have been demonstrated. However, more  detailed studies on the SATB1 functions in CRC are warranted. In this article,  we comprehensively analyze the cellular and molecular role of SATB1 in CRC cell  lines with different SATB1 expression levels by using RNAi-mediated knockdown.  Using siRNAs with different knockdown efficacies, we demonstrate  antiproliferative, cell cycle-inhibitory and proapoptotic effects of SATB1  knockdown in a SATB1 gene dose-dependent manner. Tumor growth inhibition is  confirmed in vivo in a subcutaneous tumor xenograft mouse model using stable  knockdown cells. The in-depth analysis of cellular effects reveals increased  activities of caspases-3, -7, -8, -9 and other mediators of apoptotic pathways.  Similarly, the analysis of E- and N-cadherin, slug, twist, β-catenin and MMP7  indicates SATB1 effects on epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT) and matrix  breakdown. Our results also establish SATB1 effects on receptor tyrosine kinases  and (proto-)oncogenes such as HER receptors and Pim-1. Taken together, this  suggests a more complex molecular interplay between tumor-promoting and possible  inhibitory effects in CRC by affecting multiple pathways and molecules involved  in proliferation, cell cycle, EMT, invasion and cell survival.']","Secreted protein acidic and rich in cysteine (SPARC) is a multi-faceted protein-modulating cell-cell and cell-matrix interactions. SPARC seems to act as a tumour suppressor, as it has been found that loss of SPARC accelerates the development of certain types of cancer, whereas its expression impairs tumor growth. However it has also been associated with a aggressive phenotypes of some tumours. The role of SPARC may depend on its subcellular localization."
142,Which mechanisms underlie adaptive mutagenesis (stationary-phase mutagenesis) in Bacillus subtilis?,"['Stress-promoted mutations that occur in nondividing cells (adaptive mutations)  have been implicated strongly in causing genetic variability as well as in  species survival and evolutionary processes. Oxidative stress-induced DNA damage  has been associated with generation of adaptive His(+) and Met(+) but not Leu(+)  revertants in strain Bacillus subtilis YB955 (hisC952 metB5 leuC427). Here we  report that an interplay between MutY and MutSL (mismatch repair system [MMR])  plays a pivotal role in the production of adaptive Leu(+) revertants.  Essentially, the genetic disruption of MutY dramatically reduced the reversion  frequency to the leu allele in this model system. Moreover, the increased rate  of adaptive Leu(+) revertants produced by a MutSL knockout strain was  significantly diminished following mutY disruption. Interestingly, although the  expression of mutY took place during growth and stationary phase and was not  under the control of RecA, PerR, or σ(B), a null mutation in the mutSL operon  increased the expression of mutY several times. Thus, in starved cells,  saturation of the MMR system may induce the expression of mutY, disturbing the  balance between MutY and MMR proteins and aiding in the production of types of  mutations detected by reversion to leucine prototrophy. In conclusion, our  results support the idea that MMR regulation of the mutagenic/antimutagenic  properties of MutY promotes stationary-phase mutagenesis in B. subtilis cells.', 'YqjH and YqjW are Bacillus subtilis homologs of the UmuC/DinB or Y superfamily  of DNA polymerases that are involved in SOS-induced mutagenesis in Escherichia  coli. While the functions of YqjH and YqjW in B. subtilis are still unclear, the  comparisons of protein structures demonstrate that YqjH has 36% identity to E.  coli DNA polymerase IV (DinB protein), and YqjW has 26% identity to E. coli DNA  polymerase V (UmuC protein). In this report, we demonstrate that both YqjH and  the products of the yqjW operon are involved in UV-induced mutagenesis in this  bacterium. Furthermore, resistance to UV-induced damage is significantly reduced  in cells lacking a functional YqjH protein. Analysis of stationary-phase  mutagenesis indicates that absences of YqjH, but not that of YqjW, decreases the  ability of B. subtilis to generate revertants at the hisC952 allele via this  system. These data suggest a role for YqjH in the generation of at least some  types of stationary-phase-induced mutagenesis.', 'Adaptive (stationary-phase) mutagenesis occurs in the gram-positive bacterium  Bacillus subtilis. Furthermore, taking advantage of B. subtilis as a paradigm  for the study of prokaryotic differentiation and development, we have shown that  this type of mutagenesis is subject to regulation involving at least two of the  genes that are involved in the regulation of post-exponential phase prokaryotic  differentiation, i.e., comA and comK. On the other hand, a functional RecA  protein was not required for this type of mutagenesis. The results seem to  suggest that a small subpopulation(s) of the culture is involved in adaptive  mutagenesis and that this subpopulation(s) is hypermutable. The existence of  such a hypermutable subpopulation(s) raises important considerations with  respect to evolution, the development of specific mutations, the nature of  bacterial populations, and the level of communication among bacteria in an  ecological niche.', 'The disruption of ung, the unique uracil-DNA-glycosylase-encoding gene in  Bacillus subtilis, slightly increased the spontaneous mutation frequency to  rifampin resistance (Rif(r)), suggesting that additional repair pathways  counteract the mutagenic effects of uracil in this microorganism. An alternative  excision repair pathway is involved in this process, as the loss of YwqL, a  putative endonuclease V homolog, significantly increased the mutation frequency  of the ung null mutant, suggesting that Ung and YwqL both reduce the mutagenic  effects of base deamination. Consistent with this notion, sodium bisulfite (SB)  increased the Rif(r) mutation frequency of the single ung and double ung ywqL  strains, and the absence of Ung and/or YwqL decreased the ability of B. subtilis  to eliminate uracil from DNA. Interestingly, the Rif(r) mutation frequency of  single ung and mutSL (mismatch repair [MMR] system) mutants was dramatically  increased in a ung knockout strain that was also deficient in MutSL, suggesting  that the MMR pathway also counteracts the mutagenic effects of uracil. Since the  mutation frequency of the ung mutSL strain was significantly increased by SB, in  addition to Ung, the mutagenic effects promoted by base deamination in growing  B. subtilis cells are prevented not only by YwqL but also by MMR. Importantly,  in nondividing cells of B. subtilis, the accumulations of mutations in three  chromosomal alleles were significantly diminished following the disruption of  ung and ywqL. Thus, under conditions of nutritional stress, the processing of  deaminated bases in B. subtilis may normally occur in an error-prone manner to  promote adaptive mutagenesis.', 'Postsynthesis mismatch repair is an important contributor to mutation avoidance  and genomic stability in bacteria, yeast, and humans. Regulation of its activity  would allow organisms to regulate their ability to evolve. That mismatch repair  might be down-regulated in stationary-phase Escherichia coli was suggested by  the sequence spectrum of some stationary-phase (""adaptive"") mutations and by the  observations that MutS and MutH levels decline during stationary phase. We  report that overproduction of MutL inhibits mutation in stationary phase but not  during growth. MutS overproduction has no such effect, and MutL overproduction  does not prevent stationary-phase decline of either MutS or MutH. These results  imply that MutS and MutH decline to levels appropriate for the decreased DNA  synthesis in stationary phase, whereas functional MutL is limiting for mismatch  repair specifically during stationary phase. Modulation of mutation rate and  genetic stability in response to environmental or developmental cues, such as  stationary phase and stress, could be important in evolution, development,  microbial pathogenicity, and the origins of cancer.', 'In conditions of halted or limited genome replication, like those experienced in  sporulating cells of Bacillus subtilis, a more immediate detriment caused by DNA  damage is altering the transcriptional programme that drives this developmental  process. Here, we report that mfd, which encodes a conserved bacterial protein  that mediates transcription-coupled DNA repair (TCR), is expressed together with  uvrA in both compartments of B. subtilis sporangia. The function of Mfd was  found to be important for processing the genetic damage during B. subtilis  sporulation. Disruption of mfd sensitized developing spores to mitomycin-C (M-C)  treatment and UV-C irradiation. Interestingly, in non-growing sporulating cells,  Mfd played an anti-mutagenic role as its absence promoted UV-induced mutagenesis  through a pathway involving YqjH/YqjW-mediated translesion synthesis (TLS). Two  observations supported the participation of Mfd-dependent TCR in spore  morphogenesis: (i) disruption of mfd notoriously affected the efficiency of B.  subtilis sporulation and (ii) in comparison with the wild-type strain, a  significant proportion of Mfd-deficient sporangia that survived UV-C treatment  developed an asporogenous phenotype. We propose that the Mfd-dependent repair  pathway operates during B. subtilis sporulation and that its function is  required to eliminate genetic damage from transcriptionally active genes.', 'A Bacillus subtilis mutant that partially relieves carbon catabolite repression  (CCR) of the hut operon was isolated by transposon mutagenesis. Characterization  of this mutant revealed that the transposon had inserted into the gene, mfd,  that encodes transcription-repair coupling factor. The Mfd protein is known to  promote strand-specific DNA repair by displacing RNA polymerase stalled at a  nucleotide lesion and directing the (A)BC excinuclease to the DNA damage site. A  set of transcriptional lacZ fusions was used to demonstrate that the mfd  mutation relieves CCR of hut and gnt expression at the cis-acting cre sequences  located downstream of the transcriptional start site but does not affect CCR at  sites located at the promoters. CCR of the amyE and bglPH genes, which contain  cre sequences that overlap their promoters, is not altered by the mfd mutation.  These results support a model in which the Mfd protein displaces RNA polymerase  stalled at downstream cre sites that function as transcriptional roadblocks and  reveal a new role for Mfd in cellular physiology.', 'Genomic DNA is used as the template for both replication and transcription,  whose machineries may collide and result in mutagenesis, among other damages.  Because head-on collisions are more deleterious than codirectional collisions,  genes should be preferentially encoded on the leading strand to avoid head-on  collisions, as is observed in most bacterial genomes examined. However, why are  there still lagging strand encoded genes? Paul et al. recently proposed that  these genes take advantage of the increased mutagenesis resulting from head-on  collisions and are thus adaptively encoded on the lagging strand. We show that  the evidence they provided is invalid and that the existence of lagging strand  encoded genes is explainable by a balance between deleterious mutations that  bring genes from the leading to the lagging strand and purifying selection  purging such mutants. Therefore, the adaptive hypothesis is neither  theoretically needed nor empirically supported.', 'Bacteria contain a number of error prevention and error correction systems that  maintain genome stability. However, strains exhibiting elevated mutation  frequencies have recently been reported amongst natural populations of  pathogenic Escherichia coli, Salmonella enterica, Pseudomonas aeruginosa,  Neisseria meningitidis, Helicobacter pylori and Streptococcus pneumoniae. The  majority of naturally occurring, strong mutators contain defects in the  methyl-directed mismatch repair (MMR) system, with mutations in mutS  predominating. MMR-deficient strains possess superior genetic backgrounds for  the selection of some antibiotic-resistance mutations since mutation frequencies  up to 1000-fold higher than normal strains have been reported, and resistance  levels achieved in mutators can be greater than those arising in non-mutator  hosts. MMR is a major constraint to interspecies recombination events. Removal  of this barrier, as in the case of MMR defective mutators, also enhances the  frequency of horizontal gene transfer, which is an important mechanism of  acquired drug resistance in bacteria. Permanent global mutator status is  associated with loss of fitness as mutators accumulate deleterious mutations  more frequently than non-mutators. Fitness limitations of mutators may be  overcome simply by the high bacterial cell densities that can be achieved during  acute infection or by the adoption of transient mutator status. Mutators are a  risk factor during the treatment of bacterial infections as they appear to  enhance the selection of mutants expressing high- and low-level antibiotic  resistance and have the capacity to refine existing plasmid-located resistance  determinants.', 'Oxidative damage of DNA is a source of mutation in living cells. Although all  organisms have evolved mechanisms of defense against oxidative damage, little is  known about these mechanisms in nonenteric bacteria, including pseudomonads.  Here we have studied the involvement of oxidized guanine (GO) repair enzymes and  DNA-protecting enzyme Dps in the avoidance of mutations in starving Pseudomonas  putida. Additionally, we examined possible connections between the oxidative  damage of DNA and involvement of the error-prone DNA polymerase (Pol)V homologue  RulAB in stationary-phase mutagenesis in P. putida. Our results demonstrated  that the GO repair enzymes MutY, MutM, and MutT are involved in the prevention  of base substitution mutations in carbon-starved P. putida. Interestingly, the  antimutator effect of MutT was dependent on the growth phase of bacteria.  Although the lack of MutT caused a strong mutator phenotype under carbon  starvation conditions for bacteria, only a twofold increased effect on the  frequency of mutations was observed for growing bacteria. This indicates that  MutT has a backup system which efficiently complements the absence of this  enzyme in actively growing cells. The knockout of MutM affected only the  spectrum of mutations but did not change mutation frequency. Dps is known to  protect DNA from oxidative damage. We found that dps-defective P. putida cells  were more sensitive to sudden exposure to hydrogen peroxide than wild-type  cells. At the same time, the absence of Dps did not affect the accumulation of  mutations in populations of starved bacteria. Thus, it is possible that the  protective role of Dps becomes essential for genome integrity only when bacteria  are exposed to exogenous agents that lead to oxidative DNA damage but not under  physiological conditions. Introduction of the Y family DNA polymerase PolV  homologue rulAB into P. putida increased the proportion of A-to-C and A-to-G  base substitutions among mutations, which occurred under starvation conditions.  Since PolV is known to perform translesion synthesis past damaged bases in DNA  (e.g., some oxidized forms of adenine), our results may imply that adenine  oxidation products are also an important source of mutation in starving  bacteria.']","Increased transcription levels potentiate adaptive mutagenesis. Central to stationary-phase mutagenesis in B. subtilis is the requirement for Mfd protein (transcription repair coupling factor). The B. subtilis' ability to accumulate chromosomal mutations under conditions of starvation is influenced by cell differentiation and transcriptional derepression, as well as by proteins homologous to transcription and repair factors. Under conditions of nutritional stress, the processing of deaminated bases in B. subtilis may normally occur in an error-prone manner to promote adaptive mutagenesis. A functional RecA protein is not required for adaptive mutagenesis, which seems to be independent of recombination-dependent repair and, in some cases, of the Y DNA polymerases. Oxidative stress-induced DNA damage has been associated with adaptive mutagenesis. The occurrence of such mutations is exacerbated by reactive oxygen species. Starved B. subtilis cells lacking a functional error prevention GO (8-oxo-G) system (composed of YtkD, MutM, and YfhQ) had a dramatic propensity to increase the number of stationary-phase-induced revertants. The MMR (encoded by the mutSL operon) protects B. subtilis from stationary-phase mutations. The MMR modulation of the mutagenic/antimutagenic properties of MutY regulates stationary-phase mutagenesis. Two of the genes that are involved in the regulation of post-exponential phase prokaryotic differentiation, comA and comK, are involved in adaptive mutagenesis. Also, YqjH, a homolog of DinB protein, plays a role in stationary phase mutagenesis."
143,What is MRSA?,"['Rapid laboratory methods provide optimal support for active surveillance efforts  to screen for methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA). Most  laboratories struggle to determine the optimal use of resources, considering  options to balance cost, speed, and diagnostic accuracy. To assess the  performance of common methods, the first comparison of MRSASelect agar (MS) and  CHROMagar MRSA (CA), with and without broth enrichment followed by a 24-h  subculture to MS, was performed. Results were compared to those of the Xpert  MRSA assay. For direct culture methods, the agreement between MS and CA was  98.8%. At 18 h, direct MS identified 93% of all positive samples from direct  culture and 84% of those identified by the Xpert MRSA. For Trypticase soy  broth-enriched MS culture, incubated overnight and then subcultured for an  additional 24 h, the agreement with Xpert MRSA was 96%. The agreement between  direct MS and Xpert MRSA was 100% when semiquantitative culture revealed a  bacterial density of 2+ or greater; however, discrepancies between culture and  Xpert MRSA arose for MRSA bacterial densities of 1+ or less, indicating low  density as a common cause of false-negative culture results. Since 1+ or less  was established as the most common MRSA carrier state, broth enrichment or PCR  may be critical for the identification of all MRSA carriers who may be  reservoirs for transmission. In this active-surveillance convenience sample, the  use of broth enrichment followed by subculture to MS offered a low-cost but  sensitive method for MRSA screening, with performance similar to that of Xpert  MRSA PCR.', ""The aim of this study was to assess to what extent patients with  meticillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) at respiratory sites shed  viable MRSA into the air of hospital rooms. We also evaluated whether the  distance from the patient could influence the level of contamination. Air  sampling was performed directly onto MRSA-selective agar in 24 hospital rooms  containing patients with MRSA colonization or infection of the respiratory  tract. Samplings were performed in duplicate at 0.5, 1 and 2-3 m from the  patients' heads. Clinical and environmental isolates were compared using  antimicrobial resistance patterns and pulsed-field gel electrophoresis. MRSA  strains were isolated from 21 out of 24 rooms, in quantities varying from  between 1 and 78 cfu/m3. In each of the 21 rooms, at least one of the  environmental isolates was identical to a clinical isolate from the patient in  that room. There was no significant difference in MRSA counts between the  distance from the patient's head and the sampler. This study demonstrates that  most patients with MRSA infection or colonisation of the respiratory tract shed  viable MRSA into the air of their room. The results emphasise the need to study  MRSA in air in more detail in order to improve infection control  recommendations."", 'We evaluated the new, fully automated molecular BD Max methicillin-resistant  Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) assay for detection of methicillin-resistant S.  aureus in a low-prevalence (4.1%) setting. Sensitivity, specificity, and  positive and negative predictive values were 93.9%, 99.2%, 83.8%, and 99.7%,  respectively. The assay reported fewer unresolved results than the BD GeneOhm  MRSA ACP assay.', 'Although methicillin (meticillin)-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) strains  with reduced susceptibility to vancomycin (RVS-MRSA; including  vancomycin-intermediate S. aureus [VISA] and heterogeneous VISA [hVISA]) have  been linked with vancomycin treatment failure, it is unclear whether they are  more pathogenic than vancomycin-susceptible MRSA (VS-MRSA). We prospectively  assessed patients with clinical MRSA isolates during a 10-month period to  determine clinical status (infection versus colonization) and therapeutic  outcome before correlating these findings with the results of detailed in vitro  assessment of vancomycin susceptibility, including population analysis profile  (PAP) testing. hVISA and VISA were defined by standard PAP criteria  (area-under-the-curve ratio compared to that of the reference hVISA strain Mu3  [>or=0.9]) and routine CLSI criteria (vancomycin MIC, 4 to 8 microg/ml),  respectively. Among the 117 patients assessed, 58 had RVS-MRSA isolates (56  hVISA and 2 VISA) and 59 had VS-MRSA isolates; the patient demographics and  comorbidities were similar. RVS-MRSA was associated with a lower rate of  infection than VS-MRSA (29/58 versus 46/59; P = 0.003), including a lower rate  of bacteremia (3/58 versus 20/59, respectively; P < 0.001). The cure rates in  RVS-MRSA and VS-MRSA groups were not statistically different (16/26 versus  31/42; P = 0.43), but the post hoc assessment of treatment regimes and study  size made detailed conclusions difficult. The results of the macro method Etest  correlated well with the PAP results (sensitivity, 98.3%, and specificity,  91.5%), but broth microdilution and our preliminary RVS-MRSA detection method  correlated poorly. All isolates were susceptible to linezolid and daptomycin.  These data suggest that detailed prospective laboratory identification of  RVS-MRSA isolates may be of limited value and that, instead, such in vitro  investigation should be reserved for isolates from patients who are failing  appropriate anti-MRSA therapy.', 'This article explains what methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA)  is, how it is spread and what the real challenges are in healthcare settings in  the UK. It explores the different strains of MRSA and points out the main ways  to control their spread. It is intended to be a reference source for all nurses.', 'PURPOSE: To characterize the patient demographics, clinical features, and  antibiotic susceptibility of ocular infections caused by methicillin-resistant  Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA), including community-associated (CA) and  healthcare-associated (HA) isolates. DESIGN: Retrospective, observational study. PARTICIPANTS: Patients (n = 519) with culture-proven S. aureus ocular infections  seen between January 1, 1999, and December 31, 2008, in Chang Gung Memorial  Hospital. METHODS: Data collected included patient demographics and clinical information.  Antibiotic susceptibility was verified by disc diffusion method. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Proportion of MRSA in S. aureus ocular infections and the  clinical characteristics, diagnoses, and antibiotic susceptibility patterns of  CA-MRSA versus HA-MRSA ocular infections. RESULTS: We identified 274 patients with MRSA ocular infections, which comprised  181 CA-MRSA and 93 HA-MRSA isolates. The average rate of MRSA in S. aureus  infections was 52.8% with a stable trend, whereas the annual ratio of CA-MRSA in  ocular MRSA infections averaged 66.1% and tended to increase over the 10-year  interval. Patients with ocular CA-MRSA were younger. Lid and lacrimal system  disorders were more common, but keratitis, endophthalmitis, and wound infection  were less common among CA-MRSA cases than HA-MRSA cases. Both CA-MRSA and  HA-MRSA isolates were resistant to clindamycin and erythromycin, but CA-MRSA was  more susceptible to sulfamethoxazole/trimethoprim. CONCLUSIONS: Community-associated MRSA is an important pathogen of ocular  infections; CA-MRSA and HA-MRSA ocular infections differ demographically and  clinically, but both strains were multi-resistant in Chang Gung Memorial  Hospital, one of the biggest referral centers in Taiwan. In a country with a  high prevalence of MRSA, ophthalmologists should be aware of such epidemiologic  information.', 'Methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) burden is increasing  worldwide in hospitals [healthcare-associated (HA)-MRSA] and in communities  [community-associated (CA)-MRSA]. However, the impact of CA-MRSA within  hospitals remains limited, particularly in Latin America. A countrywide  representative survey of S. aureus infections was performed in Argentina by  analyzing 591 clinical isolates from 66 hospitals in a prospective  cross-sectional, multicenter study (Nov-2009). This work involved  healthcare-onset infections-(HAHO, >48 hospitalization hours) and  community-onset (CO) infections [including both, infections (HACO) in patients  with healthcare-associated risk-factors (HRFs) and infections (CACO) in those  without HRFs]. MRSA strains were genetically typed as CA-MRSA and HA-MRSA  genotypes (CA-MRSAG and HA-MRSAG) by SCCmec- and spa-typing, PFGE, MLST and  virulence genes profile by PCR. Considering all isolates, 63% were from  CO-infections and 55% were MRSA [39% CA-MRSAG and 16% HA-MRSAG]. A significantly  higher MRSA proportion among CO- than HAHO-S. aureus infections was detected  (58% vs 49%); mainly in children (62% vs 43%). The CA-MRSAG/HA-MRSAG have  accounted for 16%/33% of HAHO-, 39%/13% of HACO- and 60.5%/0% of  CACO-infections. Regarding the epidemiological associations identified in  multivariate models for patients with healthcare-onset CA-MRSAG infections,  CA-MRSAG behave like HA-MRSAG within hospitals but children were the highest  risk group for healthcare-onset CA-MRSAG infections. Most CA-MRSAG belonged to  two major clones: PFGE-type N-ST30-SCCmecIVc-t019-PVL(+) and PFGE-type  I-ST5-IV-SCCmecIVa-t311-PVL(+) (45% each). The ST5-IV-PVL(+)/ST30-IV-PVL(+)  clones have caused 31%/33% of all infections, 20%/4% of HAHO-, 43%/23% of HACO-  and 35%/60% of CACO- infections, with significant differences by age groups  (children/adults) and geographical regions. Importantly, an isolate belonging to  USA300-0114-(ST8-SCCmecIVa-spat008-PVL(+)-ACME(+)) was detected for the first  time in Argentina. Most of HA-MRSAG (66%) were related to the Cordobes/Chilean  clone-(PFGE-type A-ST5-SCCmecI-t149) causing 18% of all infections (47% of HAHO-  and 13% of HACO-infections). Results strongly suggest that the CA-MRSA clone  ST5-IV-PVL(+) has begun to spread within hospitals, replacing the traditional  Cordobes/Chilean-HA-MRSA clone ST5-I-PVL(-), mainly in children. Importantly, a  growing MRSA reservoir in the community was associated with spreading of two  CA-MRSA clones: ST5-IV-PVL(+), mainly in children with HRFs, and ST30-IV-PVL(+)  in adults without HRFs. This is the first nationwide study in Argentina  providing information about the molecular and clinical epidemiology of CA-MRSA,  particularly within hospitals, which is essential for designing effective  control measures in this country and worldwide.', 'Borderline oxacillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (BORSA) may be  misidentified as intrinsically methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus  (MRSA) in the clinical laboratory. Under disk diffusion testing conditions  designed to maximize detection of MRSA (incubation at 32 degrees C,  pre-induction with methicillin, or plating on 4% NaCl-supplemented agar), BORSA  strains also tend to appear resistant to semisynthetic penicillins. Under these  conditions, ampicillin/sulbactam appears to be more accurate than  amoxicillin/clavulanic acid for differentiating BORSA from MRSA.', ""BACKGROUND: Methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) is a major cause  of both hospital and community infections globally. It's important to illuminate  the differences between community-acquired MRSA (CA-MRSA) and hospital-acquired  MRSA (HA-MRSA), but there have been confusions on the definition, especially for  the MRSA isolates identified within 48\xa0h of admission. This study aimed to  determine the molecular characteristics and virulence genes profile of CA and  HA-MRSA isolates identified less than 48\xa0h after hospital admission in our  region. METHODS: A total 62 MRSA isolates identified within 48\xa0h after admission and the  clinical data were collected. Antimicrobial susceptibility test (AST) of  collected isolates were performed according to the guidelines of Clinical and  Laboratory Standards Institute (CLSI) 2015, and staphylococcal cassette  chromosome mec (SCCmec) typing, multilocus sequence typing (MLST), pulsed-field  gel electrophoresis (PFGE) and virulence gene profiling were performed to  explore the molecular diversity. RESULTS: SCCmec III and sequence type (ST) 239 were the most prevalent SCCmec  type and ST in both CA and HA-MRSA groups. HA-MRSA group had higher prevalence  of SCCmec III (87.2\xa0%) and ST239 (79.5\xa0%) compared with CA-MRSA (60.9 and  43.4\xa0%, both P\u2009<\u20090.001), while the frequency of SCCmec IV (26.0\xa0%) and ST59  (21.7\xa0%) were higher in CA-MRSA than its counterpart (P\u2009<\u20090.001 and P\u2009=\u20090.003).  MRSA-ST239-III was the predominant type in this study (61.3\xa0%, 38/62),  especially in HA-MRSA group (76.9\xa0%, 30/39). However, CA-MRSA strains exhibited  more diversity in genotypes in this study. Meanwhile, CA-MRSA tended to have  lower resistant percentage to non-β-lactams antibiotics but more virulence genes  carriage, especially the staphylococcal enterotoxins (SE) genes. Notably, seb  gene was only detected in CA-MRSA isolates (52.2\xa0%), likely a significant marker  for CA-MRSA isolates. Panton-Valentine leukocidin gene (PVL) was highly detected  in both groups, while appeared no significantly different between CA-MRSA  (47.8\xa0%) and HA-MRSA (43.6\xa0%). CONCLUSIONS: Our findings support a difference in the molecular epidemiology and  virulence genes profile of CA-MRSA and HA-MRSA. Furthermore, this study  indicates a possible transmission from HA-MRSA to CA-MRSA, which may cause the  overlap of the definition."", 'The aim of the study was to determine the frequency and type of MRSA strains and  antibiotic susceptibility in Al-Zahra Hospital, Isfahan, Iran. In an analytic  descriptive survey in 2005 and early 2006, patients admitted to the hospital who  contracted S. aureus nosocomial infections were enrolled in the study. All  isolates were identified by the conventional laboratory tests. Minimal  Inhibitory Concentration (MIC) of oxacillin on isolated bacteria was determined  by E-Test method. According to Clinical and Laboratory Standard Institute (CLSI)  criteria all strains with MIC of > or = 4 microg for oxacillin were identified  as MRSA. Intrinsic high level resistance (mecA positive) and borderline  oxacillin resistant Staphylococcus aureus (BORSA) were detected by  amoxicillin-clavulanate E-test strips. Strains with MIC of > or = 4 microg for  oxacillin and > or = 8 microg for amoxicillin-clavulanate were identified as  mecA positive MRSA. Other staphylococcus with MIC > or = 4 microg for oxacillin  and < or = 4 for amoxicillin-clavulanate were identified as mecA negative MRSA  (BORSA). MIC of vancomycin also was determined on isolated bacteria. Data were  analyzed by SPSS version 13 and Who net version 5. Out of 134 Staphylococcus  aureus samples which were isolated from nosocomial infections 90 (67.2%) were  MRSA. Sixty seven out of 90 (74.5%) MRSA were mecA positive and 23 out of 90  (25.5%) were mecA negative (BORSA). Although most of the MRSA strains were  isolated from surgical site infections, there were no statistically significant  differences between types of Staphylococcus aureus growing from variant sites of  infections. Only one (1.49) of the mecA positive MRSA had reduced susceptibility  to vancomycin but all of the mecA-negative MRSA (BORSA) were sensitive to it.  Because one fourth of our staphylococcus strains are mecA negative BORSA and  there is no alternative for vancomycin against mecA positive MRSA and  Enterococcus spp. in our hospital, vancomycin should be reserved only for life  threatening infections due to these organisms. Thus MRSA typing should be done  to choose appropriate antibiotic for optimal treatment of MRSA infections.']",community-associated methicillin resistant staphylococcus aureus (ca-mrsa) has become a severe health concern because of its treatment difficulties.
144,Is lithium effective for treatment of amyotrophic lateral sclerosis?,"[""BACKGROUND: Preclinical studies have shown that lithium modifies pathological  cascades implicated in certain neurodegenerative disorders, such as Alzheimer's  disease (AD), Huntigton`s disease (HD), multiple system atrophy (MSA) and  amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS). A critical question is whether these  pharmacodynamic properties of lithium translate into neurodegenerative diseases  modifying effects in human subjects. METHODS: We reviewed all English controlled clinical trials published in PubMed,  PsycINFO, Embase, SCOPUS, ISI-Web with the use of lithium for the treatment of  neurodegenerative disorders between July 2004 and July 2014. RESULTS: Lithium showed evidence for positive effects on cognitive functions and  biomarkers in amnestic mild cognitive impairment (aMCI, 1 study) and AD (2  studies), even with doses lower than those used for mood stabilisation. Studies  of Li in HD, MSA and CSI did not show benefits of lithium. However, due to  methodological limitations and small sample size, these studies may be  inconclusive. Studies in ALS showed consistently negative results and presented  evidence against the use of lithium for the treatment of this disease. CONCLUSION: In absence of disease modifying treatments for any neurodegenerative  disorders, the fact that at least 3 studies supported the effect of lithium in  aMCI/AD is noteworthy. Future studies should focus on defining the dose range  necessary for neuroprotective effects to occur."", ""BACKGROUND: Amyotrophic lateral sclerosis is a rapidly progressive  neurodegenerative disorder characterised by loss of motor neurons leading to  severe weakness and death from respiratory failure within 3-5 years. Riluzole  prolongs survival in ALS. A published report has suggested a dramatic effect of  lithium carbonate on survival. 44 patients were studied, with 16 randomly  selected to take LiCO3 and riluzole and 28 allocated to take riluzole alone. In  the group treated with lithium, no patients had died (i.e., 100% survival) at  the end of the study (15 months from entry), compared to 71% surviving in the  riluzole-only group. Although the trial can be criticised on several grounds,  there is a substantial rationale from other laboratory studies that lithium is  worth investigating therapeutically in amyotrophic lateral sclerosis. METHODS/DESIGN: LiCALS is a multi-centre double-blind randomised parallel group  controlled trial of the efficacy, safety, and tolerability of lithium carbonate  (LiCO3) at doses to achieve stable 'therapeutic' plasma levels (0.4-0.8 mmol/L),  plus standard treatment, versus matched placebo plus standard treatment, in  patients with amyotrophic lateral sclerosis. The study will be based in the UK,  in partnership with the MND Association and DeNDRoN (the Dementias and  Neurodegnerative Diseases Clinical Research Network). 220 patients will be  recruited. All patients will be on the standard treatment for ALS of riluzole  100 mg daily. The primary outcome measure will be death from any cause at 18  months defined from the date of randomisation. Secondary outcome measures will  be changes in three functional rating scales, the ALS Functional Rating  Scale-Revised, The EuroQOL (EQ-5D), and the Hospital Anxiety and Depression  Scale.Eligible patients will have El Escorial Possible, Laboratory-supported  Probable, Probable or Definite amyotrophic lateral sclerosis with disease  duration between 6 months and 36 months (inclusive), vital capacity ≥ 60% of  predicted within 1 month prior to randomisation and age at least18 years. DISCUSSION: Patient recruitment began in June 2009 and the last patient is  expected to complete the trial protocol in November 2011. TRIAL REGISTRATION: Current controlled trials ISRCTN83178718."", 'BACKGROUND: Lithium has neuroprotective effects in cell and animal models of  amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS), and a small pilot study in patients with  ALS showed a significant effect of lithium on survival. We aimed to assess  whether lithium improves survival in patients with ALS. METHODS: The lithium carbonate in amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (LiCALS) trial  is a randomised, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial of oral lithium taken  daily for 18 months in patients with ALS. Patients aged at least 18 years who  had ALS according to the revised El Escorial criteria, had disease duration  between 6 and 36 months, and were taking riluzole were recruited from ten  centres in the UK. Patients were randomly assigned (1:1) to receive either  lithium or matched placebo tablets. Randomisation was via an online system done  at the level of the individual by block randomisation with randomly varying  block sizes, stratified by study centre and site of disease onset (limb or  bulbar). All patients and assessing study personnel were masked to treatment  assignment. The primary endpoint was the rate of survival at 18 months and was  analysed by intention to treat. This study is registered with Eudract, number  2008-006891-31. FINDINGS: Between May 26, 2009, and Nov 10, 2011, 243 patients were screened,  214 of whom were randomly assigned to receive lithium (107 patients) or placebo  (107 patients). Two patients discontinued treatment and one died before the  target therapeutic lithium concentration could be achieved. 63 (59%) of 107  patients in the placebo group and 54 (50%) of 107 patients in the lithium group  were alive at 18 months. The survival functions did not differ significantly  between groups (Mantel-Cox log-rank χ(2) on 1 df=1·64; p=0·20). After adjusting  for study centre and site of onset using logistic regression, the relative odds  of survival at 18 months (lithium vs placebo) was 0·71 (95% CI 0·40-1·24). 56  patients in the placebo group and 61 in the lithium group had at least one  serious adverse event. INTERPRETATION: We found no evidence of benefit of lithium on survival in  patients with ALS, but nor were there safety concerns, which had been identified  in previous studies with less conventional designs. This finding emphasises the  importance of pursuing adequately powered trials with clear endpoints when  testing new treatments. FUNDING: The Motor Neurone Disease Association of Great Britain and Northern  Ireland.', ""INTRODUCTION: Lithium was proposed in 2008 as an effective candidate in the  treatment of ALS after a report claimed that it was able to delay functional  deterioration by 40% and that none of the 16 patients treated with a combination  of lithium plus riluzole had died during a 15-month follow-up period. The  excellent results of this pilot study engendered considerable optimism among  patients, their families, patients' associations, and the scientific community.  This report sparked numerous phase ii clinical trials. Many patients who were  not included in these studies used all resources at their disposal to access the  drug as treatment under a compassionate use programme. OBJECTIVES: To evaluate the effectiveness of lithium in ALS using a  meta-analysis of the information reported in 12 studies which were examined for  methodological quality. MATERIAL AND METHODS: . Searches were performed using MEDLINE, EMBASE, the  Cochrane Neuromuscular Disease Group Trials Register, ClinicalTrials.gov, and  EudraCT (January 1996-August 2012). RESULTS: To date, we have information on more 1100 patients treated with  lithium. Unfortunately, the results do not confirm the positive effect described  in the pilot study, which suggests that this drug is not effective at slowing  disease progression. Two trials had to be suspended before the scheduled  completion date due to the ineffectiveness of the drug as well as numerous  adverse effects. A recently published study also ruled out any possible modest  effect. CONCLUSIONS: There is evidence to suggest that lithium has no short-term  benefits in ALS. A comparison of the group of patients treated with  lithium+riluzole and the control group treated with riluzole alone showed no  statistically significant differences in rates of functional decline,  deterioration of respiratory function, or survival time. Furthermore, there was  no evidence that it was more effective than the placebo."", ""In this review, we summarize the most important recent developments in the  treatment of amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS). In terms of disease-modifying  treatment options, several drugs such as dexpramipexole, pioglitazone, lithium,  and many others have been tested in large multicenter trials, albeit with  disappointing results. Therefore, riluzole remains the only directly  disease-modifying drug. In addition, we discuss antisense oligonucleotides  (ASOs) as a new and potentially causal treatment option. Progress in symptomatic  treatments has been more important. Nutrition and ventilation are now an  important focus of ALS therapy. Several studies have firmly established that  noninvasive ventilation improves patients' quality of life and prolongs  survival. On the other hand, there is still no consensus regarding best  nutritional management, but big multicenter trials addressing this issue are  currently ongoing. Evidence regarding secondary symptoms like spasticity, muscle  cramps or sialorrhea remains generally scarce, but some new insights will also  be discussed. Growing evidence suggests that multidisciplinary care in  specialized clinics improves survival."", 'In view of earlier reports in the literature it was tried to use TRH  (thyrotropin releasing hormone) in cases of amyotrophic lateral sclerosis. TRH  was given during 3 weeks once daily intravenously in drip infusions in a 0.4 mg  dose. For objectivization of the results the muscle power was assessed using a  five-grade scale of Lovette. TRH effect on EMG was analysed also. It was found  that in only 3 out of 14 patients with moderately progressed disease no  improvement was achieved, while in 11 cases the improvement was from 10 to 20%.  However, the improvement was transient, and TRH treatment failed to stop the  progression of the disease.', 'BACKGROUND: Riluzole is currently the only Food and Drug Administration-approved  treatment for ALS, but its effect on survival is modest. OBJECTIVE: To identify potential neuroprotective agents for testing in phase III  clinical trials and to outline which data need to be collected for each drug. METHODS: The authors identified 113 compounds by inviting input from academic  clinicians and researchers and via literature review to identify agents that  have been tested in ALS animal models and in patients with ALS. The list was  initially narrowed to 24 agents based on an evaluation of scientific rationale,  toxicity, and efficacy in previous animal and human studies. These 24 drugs  underwent more detailed pharmacologic evaluation. RESULTS: Twenty drugs were selected as suitable for further development as  treatments for patients with ALS. Talampanel and tamoxifen have completed early  phase II trials and have demonstrated preliminary efficacy. Other agents  (ceftriaxone, minocycline, ONO-2506, and IGF-1 polypeptide) are already in phase  III trials involving large numbers of patients with ALS. Remaining agents (AEOL  10150, arimoclomol, celastrol, coenzyme Q10, copaxone, IGF-1-viral delivery,  memantine, NAALADase inhibitors, nimesulide, scriptaid, sodium phenylbutyrate,  thalidomide, trehalose) require additional preclinical animal data, human  toxicity and pharmacokinetic data including CNS penetration prior to proceeding  to large scale phase III human testing. Further development of riluzole  analogues should be considered. CONCLUSIONS: Several potential neuroprotective compounds, representing a wide  range of mechanisms, are available and merit further investigation in ALS.', '30 subjects--23 with amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS), 4 with Charcot-Marie  Tooth atrophy, 2 with progressive spinal muscle atrophy and 1 with radiation  myelopathy--were given chronic low-dose TRH therapy. The effects of treatment  were assessed on the scale of Norris et al. (1974). The outcome of the study, in  agreement with some and at variance with other studies, was that TRH induced a  statistically significant neurological improvement in 17 of the 23 ALS patients  but little or none in the other ALS patients and in patients with other  neurological diseases.', 'A double-blind controlled trial of thyrotropin releasing hormone (TRH) 150 mg IM  daily in 30 patients with amyotrophic lateral sclerosis is reported. The  drug/placebo was administered for 2 months, followed by a 2-month ""wash-out"".  Evaluation of strength, functional ability, and respiratory functions was  performed. A temporary increase in the strength of some muscles was detected  following the administration of TRH, but no change in functional performance was  noted. Neither the patients nor the investigators believed the effects were of  any marked clinical significance. The course of the illness was not altered.', 'We performed double-blind crossover trials to assess the effects of  thyrotropin-releasing hormone (TRH) on amyotrophic lateral sclerosis patients.  For acute intravenous trials, 500 mg TRH or placebo with norepinephrine was  given at 1-week intervals (16 patients). CSF TRH concentration increased, and  clinical side effects appeared with TRH. For chronic studies, 25 mg TRH and a  saline placebo were given subcutaneously every day for 3 months (25 patients).  CSF TRH level increased 29-fold after a single TRH injection, and mild transient  side effects occurred. Vital signs, respiratory function, semiquantitative and  quantitative neurologic function, muscle strength by manual and dynamometer  testing, and EMG were studied. With daily TRH, 10 patients noted subjective  improvement without objective evidence, and 10 patients complained of worsening  of the disease with objective decline after TRH was stopped. Statistical  analysis, however, showed no beneficial effects from either acute or chronic TRH  trials.']","No, lithium is not effective for treatment of amyotrophic lateral sclerosis."
145,Which enzymes are inhibited by Duvelisib?,"['Epstein-Barr virus (EBV) is a ubiquitous oncogenic virus that is associated with  B cell lymphomas, including Burkitt lymphoma and Hodgkin lymphoma. Previous  studies have shown that the phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase (PI3K)/Akt pathway is  activated in EBV-associated lymphomas and can be a novel therapeutic target. An  oral dual inhibitor of PI3Kγ and PI3Kδ, duvelisib, is in clinical trials for the  treatment of lymphoid malignancies. In this study, we evaluated how duvelisib  affects the activity of the PI3K/Akt signaling pathway and if it has antitumor  effects in EBV-associated lymphoma cell lines. We found that the PI3K/Akt  signaling pathway was activated in most of the B and T cell lymphoma cell lines  tested. Additionally, duvelisib treatment inhibited cellular growth in the  tested cell lines. Overall, B cell lines were more susceptible to duvelisib than  T and NK cell lines in vitro regardless of EBV infection. However, the  additional influence of duvelisib on the tumor microenvironment was not  assessed. Duvelisib treatment induced both apoptosis and cell cycle arrest in  EBV-positive and -negative B cell lines, but not in T cell lines. Furthermore,  duvelisib treatment reduced the expression of EBV lytic genes (BZLF1 and  gp350/220) in EBV-positive B cell lines, suggesting that duvelisib suppresses  the lytic cycle of EBV induced by B cell receptor signaling. However, duvelisib  did not induce a remarkable change in the expression of EBV latent genes. These  results may indicate that there is therapeutic potential for duvelisib  administration in the treatment of EBV-associated B cell lymphomas and other B  cell malignancies.', 'Phosphoinositide-3-kinase (PI3K) is an enzyme group, known to regulate key  survival pathways in acute myeloid leukaemia (AML). It generates  phosphatidylinositol-3,4,5-triphosphate, which provides a membrane docking site  for protein kinaseB activation. PI3K catalytic p110 subunits are divided into 4  isoforms; α,β,δ and γ. The PI3Kδ isoform is always expressed in AML cells,  whereas the frequency of PI3Kγ expression is highly variable. The functions of  these individual catalytic enzymes have not been fully resolved in AML,  therefore using the PI3K p110δ and p110γ-targeted inhibitor IPI-145 (duvelisib)  and specific p110δ and p110γ shRNA, we analysed the role of these two p110  subunits in human AML blast survival. The results show that PI3Kδ and PI3Kγ  inhibition with IPI-145 has anti-proliferative activity in primary AML cells by  inhibiting the activity of AKT and MAPK. Pre-treatment of AML cells with IPI-145  inhibits both adhesion and migration of AML blasts to bone marrow stromal cells.  Using shRNA targeted to the individual isoforms we demonstrated that  p110δ-knockdown had a more significant anti-proliferative effect on AML cells,  whereas targeting p110γ-knockdown significantly inhibited AML migration. The  results demonstrate that targeting both PI3Kδ and PI3Kγ to inhibit AML-BMSC  interactions provides a biologic rationale for the pre-clinical evaluation of  IPI-145 in AML.', 'Duvelisib (IPI-145) is an oral dual inhibitor of phosphoinositide-3-kinase  (PI3K)-δ and -γ in clinical development for the treatment of hematologic  malignancies, including indolent non-Hodgkin lymphoma (iNHL). In a Phase 1,  open-label study to determine the maximum tolerated dose (MTD),  pharmacokinetics, pharmacodynamics, clinical activity, and safety of duvelisib  monotherapy in patients with advanced hematologic malignancies, duvelisib was  administered at eight dose levels (8-100\u2009mg BID) in a dose-escalation phase (n  =\u200931 evaluable patients). Two dose-limiting toxicities (DLTs), Grade 3  transaminase elevations and Grade 3 rash, occurred at 100\u2009mg BID, and the MTD  was determined to be 75\u2009mg BID. Across all doses, 58.1% of iNHL patients had a  response (19.4% complete, 35.5% partial, and 3.2% minor); median time to  response was 1.84\u2009months and duration of response was 16.9 months. Median  progression-free survival was 14.7 months, and the probability of overall  survival at 24\u2009months was 71.7%. Severe (Grade\u2009≥ 3) adverse events included  elevated liver enzymes (38.7%), diarrhea (25.8%), and neutropenia (29.0%). Three  patients, all in the 75\u2009mg BID cohort, experienced fatal AEs: E. coli sepsis,  acute respiratory failure, and fungal pneumonia. No iNHL patients experienced  Pneumocystis pneumonia. Duvelisib demonstrated favorable clinical activity and  an acceptable safety profile in these high-risk, heavily pretreated,  relapsed/refractory iNHL patients, with 25\u2009mg BID selected for further clinical  development.', 'Duvelisib is an orally active dual inhibitor of PI3K-δ and PI3K-γ in clinical  development in hematologic malignancies (HM). To identify novel pairings for  duvelisib in HM, it was evaluated alone and in combination with 35 compounds  comprising a diverse panel of standard-of-care agents and emerging drugs in  development for HM. These compounds were tested in 20 cell lines including  diffuse large B-cell, follicular, T-cell, and mantle cell lymphomas, and  multiple myeloma. Single agent activity was seen in fourteen cell lines, with a  median GI50 of 0.59 μM. A scalar measure of the strength of synergistic drug  interactions revealed a synergy hit rate of 19.3% across the matrix of drug  combinations and cell lines. Synergy with duvelisib was prominent in lymphoma  lines with approved and emerging drugs used to treat HM, including  dexamethasone, ibrutinib, and the BCL-2 inhibitor venetoclax. Western blotting  revealed that certain duvelisib-treated cell lines showed inhibition of  phosphorylated (p) AKT at serine 473 only out to 12 hours, with mTORC2 dependent  re-phosphorylation of pAKT evident at 24 hours. Combination with dexamethasone  or ibrutinib, however, prevented this reactivation leading to durable inhibition  of pAKT. The combination treatments also inhibited downstream signaling  effectors pPRAS40 and pS6. The combination of duvelisib with dexamethasone also  significantly reduced p-4EBP1, which controls cap dependent translation  initiation, leading to decreased levels of c-MYC 6 hours after treatment. In  support of the in vitro studies, in vivo xenograft studies revealed that  duvelisib in combination with the mTOR inhibitor everolimus led to greater tumor  growth inhibition compared to single agent administration. These data provide a  rationale for exploring multiple combinations in the clinic and suggest that  suppression of mTOR-driven survival signaling may be one important mechanism for  combination synergy.', 'Duvelisib is an oral dual inhibitor of phosphoinositide 3-kinase-δ (PI3K-δ) and  PI3K-γ in late-stage clinical development for hematologic malignancy treatment.  This phase 1 study evaluated maximum tolerated dose (MTD), pharmacokinetics,  pharmacodynamics (PD), efficacy, and safety of duvelisib in 210 patients with  advanced hematologic malignancies. In the dose escalation phase (n = 31),  duvelisib 8 to 100 mg twice daily was administered, with MTD determined as 75 mg  twice daily. In the expansion phase (n = 179), patients with indolent  non-Hodgkin lymphoma (iNHL), chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL), or T-cell  lymphoma (TCL) were treated with 25 or 75 mg duvelisib twice daily continuously.  Single-dose duvelisib was rapidly absorbed (time to maximum concentration, 1-2  hours), with a half-life of 5.2 to 10.9 hours. PD results showed inhibition of  phospho-AKT (S473) in CLL tumor cells following a single dose and near-complete  inhibition of CLL proliferation (Ki-67) by cycle 2. Clinical responses were seen  across a range of doses and disease subtypes: iNHL overall response rate, 58% (n  = 31) with 6 complete responses (CRs); relapsed/refractory CLL, 56% (n = 55)  with 1 CR; peripheral TCL, 50% (n = 16) with 3 CR; and cutaneous TCL, 32% (n =  19). Median time to response was ∼1.8 months. Severe (grade ≥3) adverse events  occurred in 84% of patients: neutropenia (32%), alanine transaminase increase  (20%), aspartate transaminase increase (15%), anemia and thrombocytopenia (each  14%), diarrhea (11%), and pneumonia (10%). These data support further  investigation of duvelisib in phase 2 and 3 studies. This trial was registered  at clinicaltrials.gov as #NCT01476657.', ""The crystal structure of ribonuclease A (RNase A) in complex with pdUppA-3'-p  [5'-phospho-2'-deoxyuridine-3'-pyrophosphate (P'-->5') adenosine 3'-phosphate]  has been determined at 1.7 A resolution. This dinucleotide is the most potent  low molecular weight inhibitor of RNase A reported to date (K(i) = 27 nM) and is  also effective against two major nonpancreatic RNases: eosinophil-derived  neurotoxin and RNase-4; in all cases, tight binding in large part derives from  the unusual 3',5'-pyrophosphate internucleotide linkage [Russo, N., and Shapiro,  R. (1999) J. Biol. Chem. 274, 14902-14908]. The design of pdUppA-3'-p was based  on the crystal structure of RNase A complexed with 5'-diphosphoadenosine  3'-phosphate (ppA-3'-p) [Leonidas, D. D., Shapiro, R., Irons, L. I., Russo, N.,  and Acharya, K. R. (1997) Biochemistry 36, 5578-5588]. The adenosine of  pdUppA-3'-p adopts an atypical syn conformation not observed for standard  adenosine nucleotides bound to RNase A. This conformation, which allows  extensive interactions with Asn 67, Gln 69, Asn 71, and His 119, is associated  with the placement of the 5'-beta-phosphate of the adenylate, rather than  alpha-phosphate, at the site where substrate phosphodiester bond cleavage  occurs. The contacts of the deoxyuridine 5'-phosphate portion of pdUppA-3'-p  appear to be responsible for the 9-fold increased affinity of this compound as  compared to ppA-3'-p: the uracil base binds to Thr 45 in the same manner as  previous pyrimidine inhibitors, and the terminal 5'-phosphate is positioned to  form medium-range Coulombic interactions with Lys 66. The full potential benefit  of these added interactions is not realized because of compensatory losses of  hydrogen bonds of Lys 7 and Gln 11 with the terminal 3'-phosphate and the  adenylate 5'-alpha-phosphate, which were not predicted by modeling. The results  reported here have important implications for the design of improved inhibitors  of RNase A and for the development of therapeutic agents to control the  activities of RNase homologues such as eosinophil-derived neurotoxin and  angiogenin that have roles in human pathologies."", ""The novel anticancer drug candidate brequinar sodium [DuP 785, NSC 368390,  6-fluoro-2-(2'-fluoro-1,1'-biphenyl-4-yl)-3-methyl-4-quinoline carboxylic acid  sodium salt] inhibits dihydroorotate dehydrogenase, the fourth enzyme in the de  novo pyrimidine biosynthetic pathway leading to the formation of UMP. Sixty-nine  quinoline 4-carboxylic acid analogs were analyzed as inhibitors of L1210  dihydroorotate dehydrogenase. This structure-activity relationship study  identified three critical regions of brequinar sodium and its analogs, where  specific substitutions are required for the inhibition of the activity of  dihydroorotate dehydrogenase. The three principal regions are: (i) the C(2)  position where bulky hydrophobic substituents are necessary, (ii) the C(4)  position which has a strict requirement for the carboxylic acid and its  corresponding salts, and (iii) the benzo portion of the quinoline ring with  appropriate substitutions.

In order to identify and investigate the  potential of LEKTI to interact with other proteins, a method was developed using  immobilised proteins onto arrays and nanoUPLC/MALDI-TOF MS. Using various  domains of LEKTI, we demonstrated that these domains bound a number of  kallikreins (5, 13 and 14) to varied extents on the array surface. Inhibitory  assays confirmed that binding on the protein array surface corresponded directly  to levels of inhibition. The method was then tested using skin epidermal  extracts. All forms of rLEKTI with the exception of rLEKTI 12-15, demonstrated  the binding of several potential candidate proteins. Surprisingly, the major  binding partners of LEKTI were found to be the antimicrobial peptide dermcidin  and the serine protease cathepsin G and no kallikreins. Using confocal  microscopy and Netherton syndrome skin sections, we confirmed the  co-localisation of LEKTI with dermcidin and demonstrated altered trafficking of  dermcidin in these patients. This potential new role for LEKTI as a  multifunctional protein in the protection and transport of proteins in the  epidermis and its role in disease are discussed.', 'PARP-family ADP-ribosyltransferases (PARPs) and sirtuin deacetylases all use  NAD(+) as cosubstrate for ADP-ribosyl transfer. PARP inhibitors are important  research tools and several are being evaluated in cancer treatment. With the  exception of a few tankyrase inhibitors, all current PARP inhibitors mimic the  nicotinamide moiety in NAD(+) and block the nicotinamide binding pocket. We  report here that while the activities of the four human sirtuin isoforms SIRT1,  SIRT2, SIRT3 and SIRT6 are blocked by sirtuin inhibitor Ex527 in vitro, they are  unaffected by the seven clinical and commonly used PARP inhibitors niraparib,  olaparib, rucaparib, talazoparib, veliparib, PJ34, and XAV939. These findings  indicate that PARP inhibitors containing planar nicotinamide mimetics do not  bind to sirtuin cofactor sites. In conclusion, a simple commercially available  assay can be used to rule out interference of novel PARP inhibitors with sirtuin  NAD(+) binding.', 'BACKGROUND: Several skin diseases and atopic disorders including Netherton  syndrome and atopic dermatitis have been associated with mutations and  deviations of expression of SPINK5, the gene encoding the human 15-domain serine  proteinase inhibitor LEKTI. The biochemical mechanisms underlying this  phenomenon have not yet been fully clarified. OBJECTIVES: To identify target proteinases of LEKTI important for processes of  desquamation and inflammation of the skin which will enable the development of  specific drugs. METHODS: The inhibitory activities of LEKTI domains 6 and 15 were tested on a  number of commercially available serine proteinases and also on the purified  kallikreins hK5 and hK7. In addition, recombinant hK5 was used. RESULTS: LEKTI domain 6 is a potent inhibitor of hK5 and hK7, whereas LEKTI  domain 15 exhibits inhibitory activity on plasmin. hK5 and hK7 in particular are  relevant to skin disorders. CONCLUSIONS: The inhibition of hK5 and hK7 by LEKTI domain 6 indicates an  important regulatory role of LEKTI in processes of skin desquamation and  inflammation, which may explain the severe pathological symptoms associated with  abnormalities of SPINK5 and/or its expression. Thus, LEKTI represents a  potential drug for the treatment of these disorders.']",Duvelisib is an oral dual inhibitor of phosphoinositide 3-kinase-δ (PI3K-δ) and PI3K-γ in late-stage clinical development for hematologic malignancy treatment.
146,What are the 4 histological types of lung cancer?,"['From January 1981 through December 1989, 15 patients with small advanced lung  cancer were treated surgically at the Tenri Hospital. In these cases, the  diameter of peripheral lung cancer did not exceed 3.0 cm (T1) and mediastinal  lymph nodes were proved to be N2 postoperatively by lymph node dissection or  sampling. The histological types were as follows: 8 adenocarcinoma, 4 large cell  carcinoma, 1 squamous cell carcinoma, 1 small cell carcinoma, and 1  adenosquamous carcinoma. All but one patient were received postoperative  chemotherapy and/or radiotherapy. The survival rate was 44.5% at 3 years, and  median survival time was 36 months. The mediastinal lymph node metastasis with  small peripheral lung cancer (T1N2) was ominous, and it should be said that  complete mediastinal lymph node dissection and adjuvant therapy were  indispensable to small advanced adenocarcinoma of lung.', 'It has been suggested that lung cancer is frequently associated with  polymyositis/dermatomyositis (PM/DM). The purpose of this study was to describe  the clinical features of primary lung cancer associated with PM/DM. We first  describe the clinical features of two cases treated in our hospital, and then  provide a review of the literature. Finally, 24 patients (five females and 19  males) with primary lung cancer associated with PM/DM are retrospectively  evaluated. Histological types of lung cancer were as follows: small cell lung  cancer (n = 7), squamous cell carcinoma (n = 5), adenocarcinoma (n = 2), others  (n = 5), and unknown (4). The onset of PM/DM is frequently observed before the  detection of lung cancer. This is the first report to describe the clinical  features of lung cancer associated with PM/DM.', 'INTRODUCTION: Histologically lung cancer is classified into four major types:  adenocarcinoma (Ad), squamous cell carcinoma (SqCC), large cell carcinoma (LCC),  and small cell lung cancer (SCLC). Presently, our understanding of cellular  metabolism among them is still not clear. OBJECTIVES: The goal of this study was to assess the cellular metabolic profiles  across these four types of lung cancer using an untargeted metabolomics  approach. METHODS: Six lung cancer cell lines, viz., Ad (A549 and HCC827), SqCC (NCl-H226  and NCl-H520), LCC (NCl-H460), and SCLC (NCl-H526), were analyzed using liquid  chromatography quadrupole time-of-flight mass spectrometry, with normal human  small airway epithelial cells (SAEC) as the control group. The principal  component analysis (PCA) was performed to identify the metabolic signatures that  had characteristic alterations in each histological type. Further, a metabolite  set enrichment analysis was performed for pathway analysis. RESULTS: Compared to the SAEC, 31, 27, 34, 34, 32, and 39 differential  metabolites mainly in relation to nucleotides, amino acid, and fatty acid  metabolism were identified in A549, HCC827, NCl-H226, NCl-H520, NCl-H460, and  NCl-H526 cells, respectively. The metabolic signatures allowed the six cancerous  cell lines to be clearly separated in a PCA score plot. CONCLUSION: The metabolic signatures are unique to each histological type, and  appeared to be related to their cell-of-origin and mutation status. The changes  are useful for assessing the metabolic characteristics of lung cancer, and offer  potential for the establishment of novel diagnostic tools for different origin  and oncogenic mutation of lung cancer.', 'To clarify the features of the coexistence of active pulmonary tuberculosis in  patients with lung cancer, we analyzed clinical data on 25 cases with coexisting  lung cancer and active pulmonary tuberculosis encountered at Tokyo National  Chest Hospital during the period from 1991 to 1998. There were 23 men and 2  women, with a mean age of 70 years. The incidence of lung cancer among patients  with active pulmonary tuberculosis at our hospital was 0.7 per cent, while the  incidence of active pulmonary tuberculosis in untreated lung cancer patients at  our hospital was 1.9 per cent. We classified the 25 cases into 2 groups as  follows: (1) tuberculosis sequential to lung cancer (11 cases) and (2)  tuberculosis concurrently detected with lung cancer (14 cases). All patients in  the former group were transferred from other hospitals after diagnosing the  coexistence of pulmonary tuberculosis during the management of lung cancer.  Histological types of lung cancer were squamous cell carcinoma in 12,  adenocarcinoma in 9, and small cell carcinoma in 4, and as to the disease stage,  stages III to IV were predominant. Analysis on relationship of chest X-ray  findings between lung cancer and pulmonary tuberculosis revealed that in  general, the location of lung cancer and tuberculosis seemed to be independent.  Tuberculosis in the sequential group was more extensive and severer than in the  concurrent group. In the concurrent group, treatment for tuberculosis was  successful except for one case, and coexisting tuberculosis did not seem to  affect the course of lung cancer among this group. However, in the sequential  group, 5 patients died within 3 months, 2 of them died of tuberculosis. We  consider that in the management of lung cancer, physicians should consider the  possibility of coexistent active pulmonary tuberculosis and should not make  delay in the diagnosis of active pulmonary tuberculosis.', 'To evaluate the clinical significance of monoclonal antibody against human  pulmonary surfactant apoprotein (S-AP), surgically resected lung cancer from 122  patients was studied. Paraffin embedded tissues were used for the  immunohistochemical study by the avidin-biotin-peroxidase complex method. The  results were as follows. 1. Adenocarcinoma showed highest immunoreactivity for  S-AP compared to the other histologic types. Among subtypes of adenocarcinoma,  type II alveolar epithelial type, clara cell type and mixed type of these two  types were strongly positive (100%, 77.8% and 66.7% respectively). These results  indicate that this antibody may be a good marker for the subtyping of  adenocarcinoma. 2. There were some positive cases in other histologic types  especially in peripheral type of squamous cell carcinoma. These findings suggest  that this antibody was useful for the histological differentiation of lung  cancer. 3. As to the immunohistochemical reactivity there was a good correlation  between tissue and cytological specimens, which indicate cytological studies may  be adequate for this kind of histopathological studies. 4. In our study, there  were no patients with S-AP positive carcinomas other than patients with lung  cancer. These results indicate that this antibody could be used for the  differential diagnosis between primary and secondary lung cancer.', 'Squamous cell lung cancer is a major histotype of non-small cell lung cancer  (NSCLC) that is distinct from lung adenocarcinoma. We used whole-exome  sequencing to identify novel non-synonymous somatic mutations in squamous cell  lung cancer. We identified 101 single-nucleotide variants (SNVs) including 77  non-synonymous SNVs (67 missense and 10 nonsense mutations) and 11 INDELs  causing frameshifts. We also found four SNVs located within splicing sites. We  verified 62 of the SNVs (51 missense, 10 nonsense and 1 splicing-site mutation)  and 10 of the INDELs as somatic mutations in lung cancer tissue. Sixteen of the  mutated genes were also mutated in at least one patient with a different type of  lung cancer in the Catalogue of Somatic Mutation in Cancer (COSMIC) database.  Four genes (LPHN2, TP53, MYH2 and TGM2) were mutated in approximately 10% of the  samples in the COSMIC database. We identified two missense mutations in  C10orf137 and MS4A3 that also occurred in other solid-tumor tissues in the  COSMIC database. We found another somatic mutation in EP300 that was mutated in  4.2% of the 2,020 solid-tumor samples in the COSMIC database. Taken together,  our results implicate TP53, EP300, LPHN2, C10orf137, MYH2, TGM2 and MS4A3 as  potential driver genes of squamous cell lung cancer.', 'Seventeen well-characterized human lung cancer cell lines were examined for the  presence of specific membrane receptors for epidermal growth factor (EGF) and  nerve growth factor (NGF) as well as for the production of diffusible factors  capable of stimulating soft agar growth. These cell lines represented all four  major histological types of human lung cancer including small cell carcinoma of  the lung (SCCL) and the three types of non-SCCL (epidermoid, large cell, and  adenocarcinoma). The SCCL lines included three lines referred to as ""converters""  because they had lost SCCL morphological and biochemical properties during  prolonged passage in vitro. Specific receptors for EGF and NGF were detected by  measuring the binding of 125I-radiolabeled growth factor to the cell surface.  These assays revealed that EGF receptors are found on five of six non-SCCL cell  lines and are not found on any of the SCCL lines. In contract, NGF binding was  detected at low levels on three of eight SCCL lines and on all three SCCL  converters but was not observed for non-SCCL lines. Thus, SCCL and SCCL  converter cell lines are distinguished from non-SCCL by the pattern of membrane  receptors for EGF and NGF. Such differences may ultimately prove useful as  biological markers for the different histological types of lung cancer.  Moreover, the majority of SCCL cells and all of the non-SCCL cells tested were  found to produce diffusible growth factors which can stimulate soft agar growth  of nontransformed normal rat kidney fibroblasts. Although some correlation  between soft agar growth factor production and the absence of EGF receptors may  exist for SCCL cells, the production of transforming growth factors appears to  be a general property of human lung cancer cells in vitro and is independent of  EGF receptor expression.', 'CD44, a cell adhesion molecule, has been implicated in tumor invasion and  metastasis in certain malignancies. We studied the expression of CD44 standard  (CD44s) and variant isoforms (CD44v) in 98 non-small cell lung carcinomas  (NSCLCs) by immunohistochemistry and correlated the observations with clinical  outcome. Formalin-fixed, paraffin-embedded archival tissues from 49 squamous  cell carcinomas (SCCs) and 49 adenocarcinomas (ACs) were immunostained after  microwave irradiation with monoclonal antibodies against CD44s and CD44v3, v4/5,  v6, v7/8, and v10, and the results were correlated with histological tumor type,  tumor stage, recurrence, and survival rates. SCCs of the lung showed strong  membranous expression of each of the CD44s, v3, v4/5, v6, and v10 proteins in  comparison with ACs (P < .0001). Staining for CD44 v4/5 was overwhelmingly  positive in SCCs (72%) as compared with ACs (2.2%). Intense immunoreactivity for  CD44v6 was present in 19 of 20 (95%) metastatic lung carcinomas. The bronchiolar  basal cells and alveolar pneumocytes were positive for CD44s, v3, and v6. CD44s  and variant isoform expression did not correlate with tumor stage, recurrence,  and survival rates. In conclusion, there is significant immunopositivity of  CD44s and variant isoforms in SCCs over ACs of the lung. Expression of CD44v6  may suggest an increased risk for local lymph node metastasis in NSCLCs.  CD44v4/5 reactivity may be useful to discriminate squamoid differentiation in  poorly differentiated NSCLCs.', 'Lung cancer tissues from 68 patients were examined for epidermal growth factor  (EGF) receptor levels and EGF receptor gene copy numbers. Histologic cell types  of these lung cancer tissues included squamous-cell carcinoma (n = 30),  adenocarcinoma (n = 28), large-cell carcinoma (n = 4), and small-cell carcinoma  (n = 6). Tissues of squamous-cell carcinoma exhibited exceptionally high  125I-EGF binding activity, and those of small-cell carcinoma showed no EGF  binding activity. Southern blot hybridization analysis revealed EGF receptor  gene amplification in the squamous-cell carcinomas with high EGF binding  activity. The EGF receptor levels in squamous-cell carcinomas and  adenocarcinomas were compared with their pathological staging grouping and  pathological findings, including degree of differentiation, diameter of tumor,  and lymph node metastasis. However, unlike previous reports on breast and  bladder cancers, there was no obvious correlation between these pathological  characteristics and the EGF receptor levels of lung cancer.', 'The association between connective tissue disease (CTD) and malignancy has been  an area of debate. Whether this relation is casual or causal, it would seem that  the importance of their possible relationship is twofold. The purpose of this  study is to describe the clinical features of lung cancer associated with  several CTDs. Patients with CTD associated with lung cancer were retrospectively  evaluated. A review of the clinical features of 153 reported cases from 1944 to  the present was conducted. There were 82 females and 71 males, with a median age  of 58. Histological types of lung cancer were as follows, bronchioloalveolar  cell carcinoma (39 cases), adenocarcinoma (36), squamous cell carcinoma (28),  small cell lung cancer (27), large cell carcinoma (6), others (8), and unknown  (10). There was a relationship between smoking and development of lung cancer in  patients with rheumatoid arthritis (RA) and polymyositis/dermatomyositis  (PM/DM). The majority of patients with progressive systemic sclerosis (PSS) who  developed lung cancer were female, with underlying interstitial fibrosis, and  most tumors were of bronchioloalveolar cell or adenocarcinoma cell type. Patient  characteristics were significantly different among the various groups of CTD  associated with lung cancer.']","Lung cancer is broadly subclassified on the basis of histological features into squamous cell carcinoma, adenocarcinoma, large cell carcinoma and small cell carcinoma."
147,"Which gene fusion is the result of the ""philadelphia translocation"" or the ""philadelphia chromosome"" mutation?","['Chronic myeloid leukemia (CML) is characterized by formation of a BCR-ABL fusion  gene, usually as a consequence of the Philadelphia (Ph) translocation between  chromosomes 9 and 22. Recently the development of new fluorescence in-situ  hybridization (FISH) techniques has allowed identification of unexpected  deletions of the reciprocal translocation product, the derivative chromosome 9,  in 10% to 15% of patients with CML. These deletions are large, span the  translocation breakpoint, and occur at the same time as the Ph translocation.  Such deletions therefore give rise to previously unsuspected molecular  heterogeneity from the very beginning of this disease, and there is mounting  evidence for similar deletions associated with other translocations. Several  studies have demonstrated that CML patients who carry derivative chromosome 9  deletions exhibit a more rapid progression to blast crisis and a shorter  survival. Deletion status is independent of, and more powerful than, the Sokal  and Hasford/European prognostic scoring systems. The poor prognosis associated  with deletions is seen in patients treated with hydroxyurea or interferon, and  preliminary evidence suggests that patients with deletions may also have a worse  outcome than nondeleted patients following stem cell transplantation or  treatment with imatinib. Poor outcome cannot be attributed to loss of the  reciprocal ABL-BCR fusion gene expression alone, and is likely to reflect loss  of one or more critical genes within the deleted region. The molecular  heterogeneity associated with the Philadelphia translocation provides a new  paradigm with potential relevance to all malignancies associated with reciprocal  chromosomal translocations and/or fusion gene formation.', 'Chronic myeloid leukemia (CML) is characterized by formation of the BCR-ABL  fusion gene, usually as a consequence of the Philadelphia (Ph) translocation  between chromosomes 9 and 22. Large deletions on the derivative chromosome 9  have recently been reported, but it was unclear whether deletions arose during  disease progression or at the time of the Ph translocation. Fluorescence in situ  hybridization (FISH) analysis was used to assess the deletion status of 253  patients with CML. The strength of deletion status as a prognostic indicator was  then compared to the Sokal and Hasford scoring systems. The frequency of  deletions was similar at diagnosis and after disease progression but was  significantly increased in patients with variant Ph translocations. In patients  with a deletion, all Ph(+) metaphases carried the deletion. The median survival  of patients with and without deletions was 38 months and 88 months, respectively  (P =.0001). By contrast the survival difference between Sokal or Hasford  high-risk and non-high-risk patients was of only borderline significance (P  =.057 and P =.034). The results indicate that deletions occur at the time of the  Ph translocation. An apparently simple reciprocal translocation may therefore  result in considerable genetic heterogeneity ab initio, a concept that is likely  to apply to other malignancies associated with translocations. Deletion status  is also a powerful and independent prognostic factor for patients with CML. The  prognostic significance of deletion status should now be studied prospectively  and, if confirmed, should be incorporated into management decisions and the  analysis of clinical trials.', 'The translocation of the c-abl oncogene from chromosome 9 to the bcr gene on  chromosome 22 in cases of Philadelphia chromosome-positive chronic myelogenous  leukemia (CML) generates an aberrant bcr-abl fusion transcript which may be  intimately related to the pathogenesis of CML. Because factors controlling  normal bcr expression might also be involved in the expression of this aberrant  bcr-abl transcript, we studied the patterns of expression of the normal bcr gene  in different cell types. We found that the normal bcr gene was expressed in many  different types of human cells. Moreover, the bcr gene was evolutionarily  conserved, and homologous bcr genomic sequences and RNA transcripts were readily  detected in chick tissue. The highest level of bcr expression in chick tissue  was in brain tissue, the lowest level was in liver tissue, and a truncated bcr  mRNA was noted in chick testes. Normal bcr transcripts, in addition to the  aberrant bcr-abl hybrid transcripts, have been found in all Philadelphia  chromosome-positive CML cells studied to date. Within a given CML sample, the  relative amounts of normal bcr RNA and aberrant bcr-abl RNA were similar. In  addition, the normal bcr and the aberrant bcr-abl hybrid transcripts  demonstrated similarly prolonged half-lives compared with that of the normal  abl-related transcripts in CML cells. These findings suggest that in CML cells,  similar cellular mechanisms control the steady-state levels of both the normal  bcr and the bcr-abl fusion RNAs.', ""The so-called Philadelphia (Ph) chromosome is present in more than 90% of  chronic myeloid leukemia (CML) patients. Approximately, 5-10% of these patients  show complex translocations involving a third chromosome in addition to  chromosomes 9 and 22. Since at present the majority of CML cases are treated  with imatinib, variant rearrangements do not exhibit specific prognostic  significance. However, events of therapy resistance remain to be studied. In  this study, we report a unique case of CML exhibiting an uncommon  t(21;22)(p12;q11). This translocation has been characterized by fluorescence in  situ hybridization (FISH) and array-proven multicolor banding (aMCB). Using  specific probes for the BCR and ABL genes, results of FISH showed a three-way  variant Philadelphia translocation (9;22;21)(q34;q11;p12) with a BCR/ABL fusion  residing on the der(22) and the 3'BCR region translocated on the short arm of  the derivative chromosome 21. In addition, the aMCB technique is significant in  the detection of the breakpoints of genetic changes. The underlying mechanisms  and prognostic significance of these changes are discussed."", ""Chronic myeloid leukaemia (CML) is characterized cytogenetically by a  t(9;22)(q34;ql1) reciprocal translocation which gives origin to a hybrid BCR-ABL  gene, encoding a p2lO(BCR-ABL) fusion protein with elevated tyrosine kinase  activity and transforming abilities. The t(9;22) was suggested to be associated  with genomic imprinting of centromeric regions of chromosomes 9 and 22, but the  genes directly affected by the translocation, ABL and BCR, were shown not to be  imprinted. For most diagnostic and research purposes the BCR-ABL gene can be  efficiently identified by reverse-transcription and polymerase chain reaction  (RT/PCR) amplification of its fusion transcripts, which can be quantified by  competitive PCR and similar assays for assessment of residual disease in the  follow-up of therapy. In the great majority of CML patients the BCR-ABL  transcripts exhibit a b2a2 and/or a b3a2 junction; in rare cases, the only  detectable BCR-ABL transcripts have unusual junctions, such as b2a3, b3a3, e1a2  or e6a2. There is a recent suggestion that the BCR-ABL gene may not be always  'functional', since extremely low levels of BCR-ABL transcripts can be found in  leucocytes from normal individuals and, conversely, it appears that no BCR-ABL  transcription can be detected in a proportion of Ph-positive haematopoietic  progenitors from some CML patients. The role, if any, of the reciprocal ABL-BCR  hybrid gene in CML is unknown. Although its mRNA message is in frame, no ABL-BCR  fusion protein has yet been identified in CML patients. The blast crisis of CML  has been variably associated with abnormalities of proto-oncogenes, such as RAS  and MYC, or of tumour suppressor genes, in particular RB, p53 and p16, or with  the generation of chimeric transcription factors, as in the AML1-EVI1 gene  fusion. It is likely, therefore, that multiple and alternative molecular  defects, as opposed to a single universal mechanism, underlie the acute  transformation of the disease."", 'Chronic myeloid leukemia (CML) is associated with the Philadelphia chromosome,  which arises by a reciprocal translocation between chromosomes 9 and 22 and  harbors the BCR-ABL fusion oncogene. It is unknown whether any other mutations  are needed for the chronic phase of the disease. The CML incidence increases as  a function of age with an exponent of approximately 3. A slope of 3 could  indicate that there are two mutations, in addition to the Philadelphia  translocation, that have not yet been discovered. In this work, we explore an  alternative hypothesis: We study a model of cancer initiation requiring only a  single mutation. A mutated cell has a net reproductive advantage over normal  cells and, therefore, might give rise to clonal expansion. The cancer is  detected with a probability that is proportional to the size of the mutated cell  clone. This model has three waiting times: (i) the time until a mutated cell is  produced, (ii) the time of clonal expansion, and (iii) the time until the clone  is detected. Surprisingly, this simple process can give rise to cancer incidence  curves with exponents up to 3. Therefore, the CML incidence data are consistent  with the hypothesis that the Philadelphia translocation alone is sufficient to  cause chronic phase CML.', 'BACKGROUND: The t(9;22) translocation leads to the formation of the chimeric  breakpoint cluster region/c-abl oncogene 1 (BCR/ABL) fusion gene on der22, the  Philadelphia chromosome. The p185(BCR/ABL) or the p210(BCR/ABL) fusion proteins  are encoded as a result of the translocation, depending on whether a ""minor"" or  ""major"" breakpoint occurs, respectively. Both p185(BCR/ABL) and p210(BCR/ABL)  exhibit constitutively activated ABL kinase activity. Through fusion to BCR the  ABL kinase in p185(BCR/ABL) and p210(BCR/ABL) ""escapes"" the auto-inhibition  mechanisms of c-ABL, such as allosteric inhibition. A novel class of compounds  including GNF-2 restores allosteric inhibition of the kinase activity and the  transformation potential of BCR/ABL. Here we investigated whether there are  differences between p185(BCR/ABL) and p210(BCR/ABL) regarding their sensitivity  towards allosteric inhibition by GNF-2 in models of Philadelphia  chromosome-positive acute lymphatic leukemia. DESIGN AND METHODS: We investigated the anti-proliferative activity of GNF-2 in  different Philadelphia chromosome-positive acute lymphatic leukemia models, such  as cell lines, patient-derived long-term cultures and factor-dependent lymphatic  Ba/F3 cells expressing either p185(BCR/ABL) or p210(BCR/ABL) and their  resistance mutants. RESULTS: The inhibitory effects of GNF-2 differed constantly between  p185(BCR/ABL) and p210(BCR/ABL) expressing cells. In all three Philadelphia  chromosome-positive acute lymphatic leukemia models, p210(BCR/ABL)-transformed  cells were more sensitive to GNF-2 than were p185BCR/ABL-positive cells. Similar  results were obtained for p185(BCR/ABL) and the p210(BCR/ABL) harboring  resistance mutations. CONCLUSIONS: Our data provide the first evidence of a differential response of  p185(BCR/ABL)- and p210(BCR/ABL)- transformed cells to allosteric inhibition by  GNF-2, which is of importance for the treatment of patients with Philadelphia  chromosome-positive acute lymphatic leukemia.', 'Chromosomal rearrangements involving the ABL1 gene, leading to a BCR-ABL1 fusion  gene, have been mainly associated with chronic myeloid leukemia and B-cell acute  lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL). At present, six other genes have been shown to  fuse to ABL1. The kinase domain of ABL1 is retained in all chimeric proteins  that are also composed of the N-terminal part of the partner protein that often  includes a coiled-coil or a helix-loop-helix domain. These latter domains allow  oligomerization of the protein that is required for tyrosine kinase activation,  cytoskeletal localization, and neoplastic transformation. Fusion genes that have  a break in intron 1 or 2 (BCR-ABL1, ETV6-ABL1, ZMIZ1-ABL1, EML1-ABL1, and  NUP214-ABL1) have transforming activity, although NUP214-ABL1 requires  amplification to be efficient. The NUP214-ABL1 gene is the second most prevalent  fusion gene involving ABL1 in malignant hemopathies, with a frequency of 5% in  T-cell ALL. Both fusion genes (SFPQ-ABL1 and RCSD1-ABL1) characterized by a  break in intron 4 of ABL1 are associated with B-cell ALL, as the chimeric  proteins lacked the SH2 domain of ABL1. Screening for ABL1 chimeric genes could  be performed in patients with ALL, more particularly in those with T-cell ALL  because ABL1 modulates T-cell development and plays a role in cytoskeletal  remodeling processes in T cells.', ""Chronic myeloid leukaemia (CML) is characterized cytogenetically by a  t(9;22)(q34;ql1) reciprocal translocation which gives origin to a hybrid BCR-ABL  gene, encoding a p2lO(BCR-ABL) fusion protein with elevated tyrosine kinase  activity and transforming abilities.

The Philadelphia chromosome and its corresponding fusion gene, BCR-ABL, is one of the best-known genetic abnormalities in hematological malignancies. Major BCR-ABL translocation is much more common in chronic myelogenous leukemia (CML) and minor BCR-ABL in acute lymphoblastic leukemia. "
148,Is RANKL secreted from the cells?,"['Bone destruction is a common feature of inflammatory arthritis and is mediated  by osteoclasts, the only specialized cells to carry out bone resorption.  Aberrant expression of receptor activator of nuclear factor kappa β ligand  (RANKL), an inducer of osteoclast differentiation has been linked with bone  pathology and the synovial fibroblast in rheumatoid arthritis (RA). In this  manuscript, we challenge the current concept that an increase in RANKL  expression governs osteoclastogenesis and bone destruction in autoimmune  arthritis. We isolated human fibroblasts from RA, pyrophosphate arthropathy  (PPA) and osteoarthritis (OA) patients and analyzed their RANKL/OPG expression  profile and the capacity of their secreted factors to induce osteoclastogenesis.  We determined a 10-fold increase of RANKL mRNA and protein in fibroblasts  isolated from RA relative to PPA and OA patients. Peripheral blood mononuclear  cells (PBMC) from healthy volunteers were cultured in the presence of RA, PPA  and OA synovial fibroblast conditioned medium. Osteoclast differentiation was  assessed by expression of tartrate-resistant acid phosphatase (TRAP),  vitronectin receptor (VNR), F-actin ring formation and bone resorption assays.  The formation of TRAP(+), VNR(+) multinucleated cells, capable of F-actin ring  formation and lacunar resorption in synovial fibroblast conditioned medium  cultures occured in the presence of osteoprotegerin (OPG) a RANKL antagonist.  Osteoclasts did not form in these cultures in the absence of macrophage colony  stimulating factor (M-CSF). Our data suggest that the conditioned medium of pure  synovial fibroblast cultures contain inflammatory mediators that can induce  osteoclast formation in human PBMC independently of RANKL. Moreover inhibition  of the TNF or IL-6 pathway was not sufficient to abolish osteoclastogenic  signals derived from arthritic synovial fibroblasts. Collectively, our data  clearly show that alternate osteoclastogenic pathways exist in inflammatory  arthritis and place the synovial fibroblast as a key regulatory cell in bone and  joint destruction, which is a hallmark of autoimmune arthritis.', 'Osteoprotegerin (OPG) is an essential secreted protein in bone turnover due to  its role as a decoy receptor for the Receptor Activator of Nuclear Factor-kB  ligand (RANKL) in the osteoclasts, thus inhibiting their differentiation.  However, there are additional ligands of OPG that confer various biological  functions. OPG can promote cell survival, cell proliferation and facilitates  migration by binding TNF-related apoptosis inducing ligand (TRAIL),  glycosaminoglycans or proteoglycans. A large number of in vitro, pre-clinical  and clinical studies provide evidences of OPG involvement in vascular, bone,  immune and tumor biology. This review describes an overview of the different OPG  ligands regulating its biological functions.', 'Anti-diabetic drug metformin has been shown to enhance osteoblasts  differentiation and inhibit osteoclast differentiation in vitro and prevent bone  loss in ovariectomized (OVX) rats. But the mechanisms through which metformin  regulates osteoclastogensis are not known. Osteoprotegerin (OPG) and receptor  activator of nuclear factor κB ligand (RANKL) are cytokines predominantly  secreted by osteoblasts and play critical roles in the differentiation and  function of osteoclasts. In this study, we demonstrated that metformin  dose-dependently stimulated OPG and reduced RANKL mRNA and protein expression in  mouse calvarial osteoblasts and osteoblastic cell line MC3T3-E1. Inhibition of  AMP-activated protein kinase (AMPK) and CaM kinase kinase (CaMKK), two targets  of metformin, suppressed endogenous and metformin-induced OPG secretion in  osteoblasts. Moreover, supernatant of osteoblasts treated with metformin reduced  formation of tartrate resistant acid phosphatase (TRAP)-positive multi-nucleated  cells in Raw264.7 cells. Most importantly, metformin significantly increased  total body bone mineral density, prevented bone loss and decreased TRAP-positive  cells in OVX rats proximal tibiae, accompanied with an increase of OPG and  decrease of RANKL expression. These in vivo and in vitro studies suggest that  metformin reduces RANKL and stimulates OPG expression in osteoblasts, further  inhibits osteoclast differentiation and prevents bone loss in OVX rats.', 'Obesity is markedly associated with abnormal bone density indicating the  importance of adipocytes in bone metabolism. However, the specific function of  adipocytes remains unclear, with marked discrepancies in observations of  previous studies. In the present study, the effect of adipocytes on  osteoblasts/osteoclasts was analyzed. A mouse model of obesity was established  and an in vitro co-culture system was utilized containing adipocyte and  MC3T3/RAW 264.7 cells in a Transwell plate. Compared with control mice, obese  mice exhibited low body weight and bone mineral density of the tibia and fat  cells were observed to accumulate in bone marrow. MC3T3/RAW 264.7 cells were  co-cultured with adipocytes and the mRNA and protein expression of alkaline  phosphatase and osteocalcin was found to be decreased in MC3T3-E1 cells and mRNA  and protein expression of tartrate-resistant acid phosphatase and cathepsin K  was significantly increased in RAW 264.7 cells. In addition, the effect of  adipocytes on the osteoprotegerin (OPG)/receptor activator of nuclear factor κB  ligand (RANKL)/RANK system indicated that the RANKL/OPG ratio secreted by  osteoblasts increased and RANK expression by osteoclasts increased, leading to  increased osteoclastogenesis. These results indicate that bone metabolism is  impaired in obese mice leading to decreased osteoblastogenesis and marked  increases in osteoclastogenesis and low bone mass.', ""Osteoprotegerin (OPG) is a secreted glycoprotein and a member of the tumor  necrosis factor receptor superfamily. It usually functions in bone remodeling,  by inhibiting osteoclastogenesis through interaction with a receptor activator  of the nuclear factor κB (RANKL). Transglutaminases-2 (Tgase-2) is a group of  multifunctional enzymes that plays a role in cancer cell metastasis and bone  formation. However, relationship between OPG and Tgase-2 is not studied.  Therefore, we investigated the involvement of 12-O-Tetradecanoylphorbol  13-acetate in the expression of OPG in MG-63 osteosarcoma cells. Interleukin-1β  time-dependently induced OPG and Tgase-2 expression in cell lysates and media of  the MG-63 cells by a Western blot. Additional 110 kda band was found in the  media of MG-63 cells. 12-O-Tetradecanoylphorbol 13-acetate also induced OPG and  Tgase-2 expression. However, an 110 kda band was not found in TPA-treated media  of MG-63 cells. Cystamine, a Tgase-2 inhibitor, dose-dependently suppressed the  expression of OPG in MG-63 cells. Gene silencing of Tgase-2 also signifi cantly  suppressed the expression of OPG in MG-63 cells. Next, we examined whether a  band of 110 kda of OPG contains an isopeptide bond, an indication of Tgase-2  action, by monoclonal antibody specifi c for the isopeptide bond. However, we  could not fi nd the isopeptide bond at 110 kda but 77 kda, which is believed to  be the band position of Tgase-2. This suggested that 110 kda is not the direct  product of Tgase-2's action. All together, OPG and Tgase-2 is induced by IL-1β  or TPA in MG-63 cells and Tgase-2 is involved in OPG expression in MG-63 cells."", 'The identity of the cell type responsive to sclerostin, a negative regulator of  bone mass, is unknown. Since sclerostin is expressed in vivo by mineral-embedded  osteocytes, we tested the hypothesis that sclerostin would regulate the behavior  of cells actively involved in mineralization in adult bone, the preosteocyte.  Differentiating cultures of human primary osteoblasts exposed to recombinant  human sclerostin (rhSCL) for 35 days displayed dose- and time-dependent  inhibition of in vitro mineralization, with late cultures being most responsive  in terms of mineralization and gene expression. Treatment of advanced (day 35)  cultures with rhSCL markedly increased the expression of the preosteocyte marker  E11 and decreased the expression of mature markers DMP1 and SOST. Concomitantly,  matrix extracellular phosphoglycoprotein (MEPE) expression was increased by  rhSCL at both the mRNA and protein levels, whereas PHEX was decreased, implying  regulation through the MEPE-ASARM axis. We confirmed that mineralization by  human osteoblasts is exquisitely sensitive to the triphosphorylated ASARM-PO4  peptide. Immunostaining revealed that rhSCL increased the endogenous levels of  MEPE-ASARM. Importantly, antibody-mediated neutralization of endogenous  MEPE-ASARM antagonized the effect of rhSCL on mineralization, as did the PHEX  synthetic peptide SPR4. Finally, we found elevated Sost mRNA expression in the  long bones of HYP mice, suggesting that sclerostin may drive the increased  MEPE-ASARM levels and mineralization defect in this genotype. Our results  suggest that sclerostin acts through regulation of the PHEX/MEPE axis at the  preosteocyte stage and serves as a master regulator of physiologic bone  mineralization, consistent with its localization in vivo and its established  role in the inhibition of bone formation.', 'Periostin (Postn) is a matricellular protein preferentially expressed by  osteocytes and periosteal osteoblasts in response to mechanical stimulation and  parathyroid hormone (PTH). Whether and how periostin expression influences bone  anabolism, however, remains unknown. We investigated the skeletal response of  adult Postn(-/-) and Postn(+/+) mice to intermittent PTH. Compared with  Postn(+/+), Postn(-/-) mice had a lower bone mass, cortical bone volume, and  strength response to PTH. PTH-stimulated bone-forming indices were all  significantly lower in Postn(-/-) mice, particularly at the periosteum.  Furthermore, in vivo stimulation of Wnt-β-catenin signaling by PTH, as evaluated  in TOPGAL reporter mice, was inhibited in the absence of periostin  (TOPGAL;Postn(-/-) mice). PTH stimulated periostin and inhibited MEF2C and  sclerostin (Sost) expression in bone and osteoblasts in vitro. Recombinant  periostin also suppressed Sost expression, which was mediated through the  integrin αVβ3 receptor, whereas periostin-blocking antibody prevented inhibition  of MEF2C and Sost by PTH. In turn, administration of a Sost-blocking antiboby  partially restored the PTH-mediated increase in bone mass in Postn(-/-) mice. In  addition, primary osteoblasts from Postn(-/-) mice showed a lower proliferation,  mineralization, and migration, both spontaneously and in response to PTH.  Osteoblastic gene expression levels confirmed a defect of Postn(-/-) osteoblast  differentiation with and without PTH, as well as an increased osteoblast  apoptosis in the absence of periostin. These data elucidate the complex role of  periostin on bone anabolism, through the regulation of Sost, Wnt-β-catenin  signaling, and osteoblast differentiation.', 'Estrogens and progesterones are major drivers of breast development but also  promote carcinogenesis in this organ. Yet, their respective roles and the  mechanisms underlying their action in the human breast are unclear. Receptor  activator of nuclear factor κB ligand (RANKL) has been identified as a pivotal  paracrine mediator of progesterone function in mouse mammary gland development  and mammary carcinogenesis. Whether the factor has the same role in humans is of  clinical interest because an inhibitor for RANKL, denosumab, is already used for  the treatment of bone disease and might benefit breast cancer patients. We show  that progesterone receptor (PR) signaling failed to induce RANKL in PR(+) breast  cancer cell lines and in dissociated, cultured breast epithelial cells. In  clinical specimens from healthy donors and intact breast tissue microstructures,  hormone response was maintained and RANKL expression was under progesterone  control, which increased RNA stability. RANKL was sufficient to trigger cell  proliferation and was required for progesterone-induced proliferation. The  findings were validated in vivo where RANKL protein expression in the breast  epithelium correlated with serum progesterone levels and the protein was  expressed in a subset of luminal cells that express PR. Thus, important hormonal  control mechanisms are conserved across species, making RANKL a potential target  in breast cancer treatment and prevention.', 'Parathyroid hormone (PTH) suppresses Dickkopf 1 (Dkk1) expression in  osteoblasts. To determine whether this suppression is essential for PTH-mediated  Wnt signaling and bone formation, we examined mice that overexpress Dkk1 in  osteoblasts (Dkk1 mice). Dkk1 mice were osteopenic due to abnormal osteoblast  and osteoclast activity. When fed a low-calcium diet, and in two other models of  hyperparathyroidism, these mice failed to develop the peritrabecular stromal  cell response (""osteitis fibrosis"") and new bone formation seen in wild-type  mice. Despite these effects of Dkk1 overexpression, PTH still activated Wnt  signaling in Dkk1 mice and in osteoblastic cells cultured from these mice. In  cultured MC3T3E1 preosteoblastic cells, PTH dramatically suppressed Dkk1  expression, induced PKA-mediated phosphorylation of beta-catenin, and  significantly enhanced Lef1 expression. Our findings indicate that the full  actions of PTH require intact Wnt signaling but that PTH can activate the Wnt  pathway despite overexpression of Dkk1.', 'BACKGROUND: Myeloma cells may secrete factors that affect the function of  osteoblasts, osteoclasts, or both. METHODS: We subjected purified plasma cells from the bone marrow of patients  with newly diagnosed multiple myeloma and control subjects to oligonucleotide  microarray profiling and biochemical and immunohistochemical analyses to  identify molecular determinants of osteolytic lesions. RESULTS: We studied 45 control subjects, 36 patients with multiple myeloma in  whom focal lesions of bone could not be detected by magnetic resonance imaging  (MRI), and 137 patients in whom MRI detected such lesions. Different patterns of  expression of 57 of approximately 10,000 genes from purified myeloma cells could  be used to distinguish the two groups of patients (P<0.001). Permutation  analysis, which adjusts the significance level to account for multiple  comparisons in the data sets, showed that 4 of these 57 genes were significantly  overexpressed by plasma cells from patients with focal lesions. One of these  genes, dickkopf 1 (DKK1), and its corresponding protein (DKK1) were studied in  detail because DKK1 is a secreted factor that has been linked to the function of  osteoblasts. Immunohistochemical analysis of bone marrow-biopsy specimens showed  that only myeloma cells contained detectable DKK1. Elevated DKK1 levels in bone  marrow plasma and peripheral blood from patients with multiple myeloma  correlated with the gene-expression patterns of DKK1 and were associated with  the presence of focal bone lesions. Recombinant human DKK1 or bone marrow serum  containing an elevated level of DKK1 inhibited the differentiation of osteoblast  precursor cells in vitro. CONCLUSIONS: The production of DKK1, an inhibitor of osteoblast differentiation,  by myeloma cells is associated with the presence of lytic bone lesions in  patients with multiple myeloma.']",Receptor activator of nuclear factor κB ligand (RANKL) is a cytokine predominantly secreted by osteoblasts.
149,Is micro RNA 1 (miR-1) implicated in cardiac arrhythmias?,"['MicroRNAs are small endogenous noncoding RNAs that regulate protein expression  by hybridization to imprecise complementary sequences of target mRNAs. Changes  in abundance of muscle-specific microRNA, miR-1, have been implicated in cardiac  disease, including arrhythmia and heart failure. However, the specific molecular  targets and cellular mechanisms involved in the action of miR-1 in the heart are  only beginning to emerge. In this study we investigated the effects of increased  expression of miR-1 on excitation-contraction coupling and Ca(2+) cycling in rat  ventricular myocytes using methods of electrophysiology, Ca(2+) imaging and  quantitative immunoblotting. Adenoviral-mediated overexpression of miR-1 in  myocytes resulted in a marked increase in the amplitude of the inward Ca(2+)  current, flattening of Ca(2+) transients voltage dependence, and enhanced  frequency of spontaneous Ca(2+) sparks while reducing the sarcoplasmic reticulum  Ca(2+) content as compared with control. In the presence of isoproterenol,  rhythmically paced, miR-1-overexpressing myocytes exhibited spontaneous  arrhythmogenic oscillations of intracellular Ca(2+), events that occurred rarely  in control myocytes under the same conditions. The effects of miR-1 were  completely reversed by the CaMKII inhibitor KN93. Although phosphorylation of  phospholamban was not altered, miR-1 overexpression increased phosphorylation of  the ryanodine receptor (RyR2) at S2814 (Ca(2+)/calmodulin-dependent protein  kinase) but not at S2808 (protein kinase A). Overexpression of miR-1 was  accompanied by a selective decrease in expression of the protein phosphatase  PP2A regulatory subunit B56alpha involved in PP2A targeting to specialized  subcellular domains. We conclude that miR-1 enhances cardiac  excitation-contraction coupling by selectively increasing phosphorylation of the  L-type and RyR2 channels via disrupting localization of PP2A activity to these  channels.', 'MicroRNAs are key, recently discovered, regulators of gene expression. They are  involved in many physiological cellular pathways so it is not surprising that an  altered microRNA expression pattern can be involved in the pathogenesis of many  disease states. The possibility to manipulate microRNAs to obtain a  therapeutical effect is very attractive since they represent specific targets in  a particular cellular pathway and because it is quite easy to synthesize short  oligonucleotides with the ability to interfere with microRNA mechanism of  action. The main problem for microRNA-based therapy is represented by delivery.  In the last two years many studies have underlined the involvement of microRNAs  in many aspects of ischemic heart disease, the leading cause of morbidity and  mortality in the Western World. MiR-29 is involved in fibrotic reaction after  myocardial infarction while miR-21 may exert a fundamental role in  post-angioplasty restenosis. MiR-208 is involved in the shift toward a fetal  gene expression pattern in contractile proteins in heart failure. MiR-1  influences susceptibility to cardiac arrhythmias after myocardial infarction.  This review will focus on microRNAs involvement in multiple aspects of ischemic  heart disease and on their promising novel therapeutic applications including  some recent patents.', 'AIMS: The present study was designed to investigate whether the beneficial  effects of beta-blocker propranolol are related to regulation of microRNA miR-1. METHODS AND RESULTS: We demonstrated that propranolol reduced the incidence of  arrhythmias in a rat model of myocardial infarction by coronary artery  occlusion. Overexpression of miR-1 was observed in ischaemic myocardium and  strikingly, administration of propranolol reversed the up-regulation of miR-1  nearly back to the control level. In agreement with its miR-1-reducing effect,  propranolol relieved myocardial injuries during ischaemia, restored the membrane  depolarization and cardiac conduction slowing, by rescuing the expression of  inward rectifying K(+) channel subunit Kir2.1 and gap junction channel connexin  43. Our results further revealed that the beta-adrenoceptor-cAMP-Protein Kinase  A (PKA) signalling pathway contributed to the expression of miR-1, and serum  response factor (SRF), which is known as one of the transcriptional enhancers of  miR-1, was up-regulated in ischaemic myocardium. Moreover, propranolol inhibited  the beta-adrenoceptor-cAMP-PKA signalling pathway and suppressed SRF expression. CONCLUSION: We conclude that the beta-adrenergic pathway can stimulate  expression of arrhythmogenic miR-1, contributing to ischaemic arrhythmogenesis,  and beta-blockers produce their beneficial effects partially by down-regulating  miR-1, which might be a novel strategy for ischaemic cardioprotection.', 'MicroRNAs are small regulatory RNA molecules that mediate regulation of gene  expression, thus affecting a variety of physiological, developmental and  pathological conditions. They are believed to be new promising therapeutic  targets. In recent studies two muscle-specific microRNAs were discovered to  contribute to heart diseases and development: miR-1 and miR-133, but there is  little data on their expression patterns in human myocardial infarction. We  performed simultaneous expression analysis of miR-1, miR-133a, miR-133b in  samples of infarcted tissue and remote myocardium from twenty- four patients  with acute myocardial infarction. MicroRNA expression was analysed using  quantitative real-time PCR and compared to the expression patterns in myocardium  of eight healthy adults who died in accidents. We found ~3.8-fold miR-1  up-regulation in remote myocardium when compared to infarcted tissue or healthy  adult hearts. As miR-1 has been shown in animal models and clinical studies to  contribute to arrhythmogenesis by regulating pacemaker channel genes, our  finding of miR-1 up-regulation in patients with myocardial infarction indicates  that it might be responsible for the higher risk for arrhythmias in these  patients. In addition, miR-133a/b down-regulation in infarcted tissue and remote  myocardium was observed, indicating miR-133a/b involvement in the heart response  to myocardial infarction. We conclude that miR-1 and miR-133 seem to be  important regulators of heart adaptation after ischaemic stress.', ""MicroRNAs (miRNAs) are increasingly reported to have important roles in diverse  biological and pathological processes.

The expression levels of miR-1  and its target gene Connexin 43 (Cx43) were measured by real-time PCR and  western blotting, respectively. The miR-1 expression levels were significantly  increased in cardiac myocytes from VMC mice in comparison with control samples  (relative expression: 10 ± 2.5 vs. 31 ± 7.6, P < 0.05). Among the target genes  of miR-1, the expression Cx43 protein was significantly reduced in such mice  while there was no significant difference in the its mRNA levels. Our results  revealed an inverse correlation between miR-1 levels and Cx43 protein expression  in VMC samples. Using a bioinformatics-based approach, we found two identical  potential binding sites were found in mouse miR-1 and Cx43 3'- untranslated  region, this confirms a possible regulatory role of miR-1. In cultured, miRNA  transfected myocardial cells, we show overexpression of miR-1 accompanied by a  decrease in Cx43 protein's expression. There was only a slight (not  statistically significant) drop in Cx43 mRNA levels. Our results indicate that  miR-1 is involved in VMC via post-transcriptional repression of Cx43, and might  constitute potentially valuable data for the development of a new approach in  the treatment of this disease."", 'MicroRNAs comprise a broad class of small non-coding RNAs that control  expression of complementary target messenger RNAs. Dysregulation of microRNAs by  several mechanisms has been described in various disease states including  cardiac disease. Whereas previous studies of cardiac disease have focused on  microRNAs that are primarily expressed in cardiomyocytes, the role of microRNAs  expressed in other cell types of the heart is unclear. Here we show that  microRNA-21 (miR-21, also known as Mirn21) regulates the ERK-MAP kinase  signalling pathway in cardiac fibroblasts, which has impacts on global cardiac  structure and function. miR-21 levels are increased selectively in fibroblasts  of the failing heart, augmenting ERK-MAP kinase activity through inhibition of  sprouty homologue 1 (Spry1). This mechanism regulates fibroblast survival and  growth factor secretion, apparently controlling the extent of interstitial  fibrosis and cardiac hypertrophy. In vivo silencing of miR-21 by a specific  antagomir in a mouse pressure-overload-induced disease model reduces cardiac  ERK-MAP kinase activity, inhibits interstitial fibrosis and attenuates cardiac  dysfunction. These findings reveal that microRNAs can contribute to myocardial  disease by an effect in cardiac fibroblasts. Our results validate miR-21 as a  disease target in heart failure and establish the therapeutic efficacy of  microRNA therapeutic intervention in a cardiovascular disease setting.', 'Cardiac arrhythmias continue to pose a major medical challenge and significant  public health burden. Atrial fibrillation, the most prevalent arrhythmia,  affects more than two million Americans annually and is associated with a  twofold increase in mortality. In addition, more than 250,000 Americans each  year suffer ventricular arrhythmias, often resulting in sudden cardiac death.  Despite the high incidence and societal impact of cardiac arrhythmias, presently  there are insufficient insights into the molecular mechanisms involved in  arrhythmia generation, propagation, and/or maintenance or into the molecular  determinants of disease risk, prognosis, and progression. In addition, present  therapeutic strategies for arrhythmia abatement often are ineffective or require  palliative device therapy after persistent changes in the electrical and  conduction characteristics of the heart have occurred, changes that appear to  increase the risk for arrhythmia progression. This article reviews our present  understanding of the complexity of mechanisms that regulate cardiac membrane  excitability and cardiac function and explores the role of derangements in these  mechanisms that interact to induce arrhythmogenic substrates. Approaches are  recommended for future investigations focused on providing new mechanistic  insights and therapeutic interventions.', 'Several recent reports have suggested that microRNAs (miRNAs) might play  critical roles in acute myocardial infarction (AMI). However, the miRNA  expression signature in the early phase of AMI has not been identified. In this  study, the miRNA expression signature was investigated in rat hearts 6 h after  AMI. Compared with the expression signature in the noninfarcted areas, 38 miRNAs  were differentially expressed in infarcted areas and 33 miRNAs were aberrantly  expressed in the border areas. Remarkably, miR-21 expression was significantly  down-regulated in infarcted areas, but was up-regulated in border areas. The  down-regulation of miR-21 in the infarcted areas was inhibited by ischemic  preconditioning, a known cardiac protective method. Overexpression of miR-21 via  adenovirus expressing miR-21 (Ad-miR-21) decreased myocardial infarct size by  29% at 24 h and decreased the dimension of left ventricles at 2 weeks after AMI.  Using both gain-of-function and loss-of-function approaches in cultured cardiac  myocytes, we identified that miR-21 had a protective effect on ischemia-induced  cell apoptosis that was associated with its target gene programmed cell death 4  and activator protein 1 pathway. The protective effect of miR-21 against  ischemia-induced cardiac myocyte damage was further confirmed in vivo by  decreased cell apoptosis in the border and infarcted areas of the infarcted rat  hearts after treatment with Ad-miR-21. The results suggest that miRNAs such as  miR-21 may play critical roles in the early phase of AMI.', 'Reactive oxygen species (ROS)-induced cardiac cell injury via expression changes  of multiple genes plays a critical role in the pathogenesis of numerous heart  diseases. MicroRNAs (miRNAs) comprise a novel class of endogenous, small,  noncoding RNAs that negatively regulate about 30% of the genes in a cell via  degradation or translational inhibition of their target mRNAs. Currently, the  effects of ROS on miRNA expression and the roles of miRNAs in ROS-mediated  injury on cardiac myocytes are uncertain. Using quantitative real-time RT-PCR  (qRT-PCR), we demonstrated that microRNA-21 (miR-21) was upregulated in cardiac  myocytes after treatment with hydrogen peroxide (H(2)O(2)). To determine the  potential roles of miRNAs in H(2)O(2)-mediated gene regulation and cellular  injury, miR-21 expression was downregulated by miR-21 inhibitor and upregulated  by pre-miR-21. H(2)O(2)-induced cardiac cell death and apoptosis were increased  by miR-21 inhibitor and was decreased by pre-miR-21. Programmed cell death 4  (PDCD4) that was regulated by miR-21 and was a direct target of miR-21 in  cardiac myocytes. Pre-miR-21-mediated protective effect on cardiac myocyte  injury was inhibited in H(2)O(2)-treated cardiac cells via adenovirus-mediated  overexpression of PDCD4 without miR-21 binding site. Moreover, Activator protein  1 (AP-1) was a downstream signaling molecule of PDCD4 that was involved in  miR-21-mediated effect on cardiac myocytes. The results suggest that miR-21 is  sensitive to H(2)O(2) stimulation. miR-21 participates in H(2)O(2)-mediated gene  regulation and functional modulation in cardiac myocytes. miR-21 might play an  essential role in heart diseases related to ROS such as cardiac hypertrophy,  heart failure, myocardial infarction, and myocardial ischemia/reperfusion  injury.', 'Myocardial ischaemia/reperfusion (I/R)-induced remodelling generally includes  cell death (necrosis and apoptosis), myocyte hypertrophy, angiogenesis, cardiac  fibrosis, and myocardial dysfunction. It is becoming increasingly clear that  microRNAs (miRNAs or miRs), a group of highly conserved small (∼18-24  nucleotide) non-coding RNAs, fulfil specific functions in the reperfused  myocardium towards post-infarct remodelling. While miR-21, -133, -150, -195, and  -214 regulate cardiomyocyte hypertrophy, miR-1/-133 and miR-208 have been  elucidated to influence myocardial contractile function. In addition, miR-21,  -24, -133, -210, -494, and -499 appear to protect myocytes against I/R-induced  apoptosis, whereas miR-1, -29, -199a, and -320 promote apoptosis. Myocardial  fibrosis can be regulated by the miR-29 family and miR-21. Moreover, miR-126 and  miR-210 augment I/R-induced angiogenesis, but miR-24, -92a, and -320 suppress  post-infarct neoangiogenesis. In this review, we summarize the latest advances  in the identification of myocardial ischaemia-associated miRNAs and their  functional significance in the modulation of I/R-triggered remodelling.  Controversial effects of some miRNAs in post-infarct remodelling will be also  discussed.']","Yes. miR-1 overexpression may contribute to the increased susceptibility of the heart to AVB, which provides us novel insights into the molecular mechanisms underlying ischemic cardiac arrhythmias. As miR-1 has been shown in animal models and clinical studies to contribute to arrhythmogenesis by regulating pacemaker channel genes, our finding of miR-1 up-regulation in patients with myocardial infarction indicates that it might be responsible for the higher risk for arrhythmias in these patients."
150,What is mechanism of action of galunisertib?,"['BACKGROUND: Glioblastoma multiforme (GBM) is characterized by lethal  aggressiveness and patients with GBM are in urgent need for new therapeutic  avenues to improve quality of life. Current studies on tumor invasion focused on  roles of cytokines in tumor microenvironment and numerous evidence suggests that  TGF-β2 is abundant in glioma microenvironment and vital for glioma invasion.  Autopagy is also emerging as a critical factor in aggressive behaviors of cancer  cells; however, the relationship between TGF-β2 and autophagy in glioma has been  poorly understood. METHODS: U251, T98 and U87 GBM cell lines as well as GBM cells from a primary  human specimen were used in vitro and in vivo to evaluate the effect of TGF-β2  on autophagy. Western blot, qPCR, immunofluorescence and transmission-electron  microscope were used to detect target molecular expression. Lentivirus and siRNA  vehicle were introduced to establish cell lines, as well as mitotracker and  seahorse experiment to study the metabolic process in glioma. Preclinical  therapeutic efficacy was evaluated in orthotopic xenograft mouse models. RESULTS: Here we demonstrated that TGF-β2 activated autophagy in human glioma  cell lines and knockdown of Smad2 or inhibition of c-Jun NH2-terminal kinase,  attenuated TGF-β2-induced autophagy. TGF-β2-induced autophagy is important for  glioma invasion due to the alteration of epithelial-mesenchymal transition and  metabolism conversion, particularly influencing mitochondria trafficking and  membrane potential (△Ψm). Autopaghy also initiated a feedback on TGF-β2 in  glioma by keeping its autocrine loop and affecting Smad2/3/7 expression. A  xenograft model provided additional confirmation on combination of TGF-β  inhibitor (Galunisertib) and autophagy inhibitor (CQ) to better ""turn off"" tumor  growth. CONCLUSION: Our findings elucidated a potential mechanism of  autophagy-associated glioma invasion that TGF-β2 could initiate autophagy via  Smad and non-Smad pathway to promote glioma cells\' invasion.', 'Galunisertib (LY2157299) is a selective ATP-mimetic inhibitor of TGF-β receptor  (TβR)-I activation currently under clinical investigation in hepatocellular  carcinoma (HCC) patients. Our study explored the effects of galunisertib in  vitro in HCC cell lines and ex vivo on patient samples. Galunisertib was  evaluated in HepG2, Hep3B, Huh7, JHH6 and SK-HEP1 cells as well as in  SK-HEP1-derived cells tolerant to sorafenib (SK-Sora) and sunitinib (SK-Suni).  Exogenous stimulation of all HCC cell lines with TGF-β yielded downstream  activation of p-Smad2 and p-Smad3 that was potently inhibited with galunisertib  treatment at micromolar concentrations. Despite limited antiproliferative  effects, galunisertib yielded potent anti-invasive properties. Tumor slices from  13 patients with HCC surgically resected were exposed ex vivo to 1 µM and 10 µM  galunisertib, 5 µM sorafenib or a combination of both drugs for 48 hours.  Galunisertib but not sorafenib decreased p-Smad2/3 downstream TGF-β signaling.  Immunohistochemistry analysis of galunisertib and sorafenib-exposed samples  showed a significant decrease of the proliferative marker Ki67 and increase of  the apoptotic marker caspase-3. In combination, galunisertib potentiated the  effect of sorafenib efficiently by inhibiting proliferation and increasing  apoptosis. Our data suggest that galunisertib may be active in patients with HCC  and could potentiate the effects of sorafenib.', 'BACKGROUND: The combination of galunisertib, a transforming growth factor  (TGF)-β receptor (R)1 kinase inhibitor, and lomustine was found to have  antitumor activity in murine models of glioblastoma. METHODS: Galunisertib (300 mg/day) was given orally 14 days on/14 days off  (intermittent dosing). Lomustine was given as approved. Patients were randomized  in a 2:1:1 ratio to galunisertib + lomustine, galunisertib monotherapy, or  placebo + lomustine. The primary objective was overall survival (OS); secondary  objectives were safety, pharmacokinetics (PKs), and antitumor activity. RESULTS: One hundred fifty-eight patients were randomized: galunisertib +  lomustine (N = 79), galunisertib (N = 39), and placebo + lomustine (N = 40).  Baseline characteristics were: male (64.6%), white (75.3%), median age 58 years,  ECOG performance status (PS) 1 (63.3%), and primary glioblastoma (93.7%). The  PKs of galunisertib were not altered with lomustine, and galunisertib had a  median half-life of ∼8 hours. Median OS in months (95% credible interval [CrI])  for galunisertib + lomustine was 6.7 (range: 5.3-8.5), 8.0 (range: 5.7-11.7) for  galunisertib alone, and 7.5 (range: 5.6-10.3) for placebo + lomustine. There was  no difference in OS for patients treated with galunisertib + lomustine compared  with placebo + lomustine [P (HR < 1) = 26%]. Median progression-free survival of  ∼2 months was observed in all 3 arms. Among 8 patients with IDH1 mutation, 7  patients were treated with galunisertib (monotherapy or with lomustine); OS  ranged from 4 to 17 months. Patients treated with galunisertib alone had fewer  drug-related grade 3/4 adverse events (n = 34) compared with lomustine-treated  patients (10% vs 26%). Baseline PS, post-discontinuation of bevacizumab, tumor  size, and baseline levels of MDC/CCL22 were correlated with OS. CONCLUSIONS: Galunisertib + lomustine failed to demonstrate improved OS relative  to placebo + lomustine. Efficacy outcomes were similar in all 3 arms.

Galunisertib, a TGF-β receptor type I kinase inhibitor, is a potential candidate  for the treatment of liver fibrosis. Here, we evaluated the potency of  galunisertib in a human ex vivo model of liver fibrosis. EXPERIMENTAL APPROACH: Antifibrotic potency and associated mechanisms were  studied ex vivo, using both healthy and cirrhotic human precision-cut liver  slices. Fibrosis-related parameters, both transcriptional and translational  level, were assessed after treatment with galunisertib. KEY RESULTS: Galunisertib showed a prominent antifibrotic potency.  Phosphorylation of SMAD2 was inhibited, while that of SMAD1 remained unchanged.  In healthy and cirrhotic human livers, spontaneous transcription of numerous  genes encoding collagens, including collagen type I, α 1, collagen maturation,  non-collageneous extracellular matrix (ECM) components, ECM remodelling and  selected ECM receptors was significantly decreased. The reduction of  fibrosis-related transcription was paralleled by a significant inhibition of  procollagen I C-peptide released by both healthy and cirrhotic human liver  slices. Moreover, galunisertib showed similar antifibrotic potency in human and  rat lives. CONCLUSIONS AND IMPLICATIONS: Galunisertib is a drug that deserves to be further  investigated for the treatment of liver fibrosis. Inhibition of SMAD2  phosphorylation is probably a central mechanism of action. In addition, blocking  the production and maturation of collagens and promoting their degradation are  related to the antifibrotic action of galunisertib.', 'Protein geranylgeranylation (GGylation) is an important biochemical process for  many cellular signaling molecules. Previous studies have shown that GGylation is  essential for cell survival in many types of cancer. However, the molecular  mechanism mediating the cell survival effect remains elusive. In this report, we  show that the Hippo pathway mediates GGylation-dependent cell proliferation and  migration in breast cancer cells. Blockade of GGylation enhanced phosphorylation  of Mst1/2 and Lats1, and inhibited YAP and TAZ activity and the Hippo-YAP/TAZ  pathway-dependent transcription. The effect of GGylation blockade on inhibition  of breast cancer cell proliferation and migration is dependent on the  Hippo-YAP/TAZ signaling, in which YAP appears to regulate cell proliferation and  TAZ to regulate cell migration. Furthermore, GGylation-dependent cell  proliferation is correlated with the activity of YAP/TAZ in breast cancer cells.  Finally, Gγ and RhoA are the GGylated proteins that may transduce GGylation  signals to the Hippo-YAP/TAZ pathway. Taken together, our studies have  demonstrated that the Hippo-YAP/TAZ pathway is essential for GGylation-dependent  cancer cell proliferation and migration.', 'We have defined the mechanism of action of lurbinectedin, a marine-derived drug  exhibiting a potent antitumor activity across several cancer cell lines and  tumor xenografts. This drug, currently undergoing clinical evaluation in  ovarian, breast, and small cell lung cancer patients, inhibits the transcription  process through (i) its binding to CG-rich sequences, mainly located around  promoters of protein-coding genes; (ii) the irreversible stalling of elongating  RNA polymerase II (Pol II) on the DNA template and its specific degradation by  the ubiquitin/proteasome machinery; and (iii) the generation of DNA breaks and  subsequent apoptosis. The finding that inhibition of Pol II phosphorylation  prevents its degradation and the formation of DNA breaks after drug treatment  underscores the connection between transcription elongation and DNA repair. Our  results not only help to better understand the high specificity of this drug in  cancer therapy but also improve our understanding of an important transcription  regulation mechanism.

Since both Met and HIF-1alpha proteins are heat shock  protein (Hsp) 90 clients, Hsp90 inhibitors might be expected to positively  impact tumor progression. Here, we systematically evaluated the inhibitory  effects of the prototypical Hsp90 inhibitor geldanamycin (GA) on cellular  processes involved in invasion and angiogenesis in T24 bladder cancer cells  stimulated with HGF and chemical hypoxia. First, we demonstrated the positive  feedback loop between Met and HIF-1 pathways, which serves to sustain and  amplifies their signaling in T24 cells. GA downregulated Met by inhibiting new  protein maturation, thereby dampening HGF signaling. HGF and chemical hypoxia  with CoCl2 cooperatively promoted in vitro invasion and vascular endothelial  growth factor (VEGF) secretion, while CoCl2 but not HGF activated urokinase-type  plasminogen activator and matrix metalloproteinase 2, both of which promote  invasion and angiogenesis. Low dose GA (100 nmol/L) inhibited these processes by  suppressing both HGF and HIF-1 pathways. Notably, brief GA pretreatment  inhibited in vitro invasion and VEGF secretion induced by HGF as effectively as  did continuous treatment. Moreover, we found that GA inhibited activation of  focal adhesion kinase, focal adhesion assembly, and actin reorganization induced  by HGF and integrin engagement by extracellular matrix. Thus, GA widely  suppresses extrinsic stimuli-induced signaling that contribute to tumor invasion  and angiogenesis in this bladder carcinoma model, suggesting the utility of  Hsp90 inhibitors in preventing tumor progression and metastasis.', 'A number of molecular therapeutic agents, derived from exploiting our knowledge  of the oncogenic pathways that are frequently deregulated in cancer, are now  entering clinical trials. One of these is the novel agent  17-allylamino-17-demethoxygeldanamycin that acts to inhibit the hsp90 molecular  chaperone. Treatment of four human colon cancer cell lines with iso-effective  concentrations of this agent resulted in depletion of c-raf-1 and akt and  inhibition of signal transduction. We have used gene expression array analysis  to identify genes responsive to treatment with this drug. The expression of  hsp90 client protein genes was not affected, but hsc hsp70, hsp90beta, keratin  8, keratin 18 and caveolin-1 were deregulated following treatment. These  observations were consistent with inhibition of signal transduction and  suggested a possible mechanism of resistance or recovery from  17-allylamino-17-demethoxygeldanamycin treatment. The results shed light on the  molecular mode of action of the hsp90 inhibitors, and suggest possible molecular  markers of drug action for use in hypothesis testing clinical trials.

In our study, we found that the combination of a  Met inhibitor, cabozantinib, and a novel FAK inhibitor, CT-707, exerted  synergistic antitumor effects against hepatocellular carcinoma in vitro and in  vivo Interestingly, further studies showed that therapeutic concentrations of  cabozantinib increased the phosphorylation of FAK, which might attenuate the  antitumor activity of cabozantinib. The simultaneous exposure to CT-707  effectively inhibited the activation of FAK that was induced by cabozantinib,  which contributes to the synergistic effect of the combination. Furthermore,  cabozantinib increased the mRNA and protein levels of integrin α5, which is a  canonical upstream of FAK, and the introduction of cilengitide to block integrin  function could abrogate FAK activation by cabozantinib, indicating that  cabozantinib upregulated the phosphorylation of FAK in an integrin-dependent  manner. Similar synergy was also observed on PHA-665752, another selective MET  inhibitor, indicating that this observation might be a common characteristic of  MET-targeting strategies. Our findings not only favor the development of the  novel FAK inhibitor CT-707 as a therapeutic agent against hepatocellular  carcinoma but also provide a new strategy of combining MET and FAK inhibitors to  potentiate the anticancer activities of these two types of agents for treating  hepatocellular carcinoma patients.

151,Mutations in which gene determine response to both erlotinib and gefitinib?,"['Although cancers may have many genetic alterations, there are only a few  mutations actually associated with essential traits of cancer cells such as cell  proliferation or evasion from apoptosis. Because cancer cells are ""addicted"" to  these ""drive genes"" , pharmacologic inhibition of these gene function is highly  effective. Epidermal growth factor receptor(EGFR)-tyrosine kinase  inhibitor(TKI)(such as gefitinib or erlotinib)treatment of lung cancer harboring  EGFR gene mutation is one of the prototypes of such therapies. Several clinical  trials clearly demonstrated that progression-free survival of patients treated  with EGFR-TKI is significantly longer than that of those treated by conventional  platinum doublet chemotherapy. EGFR-TKI therapy dramatically changed the  paradigm of lung cancer treatment. Furthermore, in 2012, crizotinib was approved  for lung cancer treatment with anaplastic lymphoma kinase(ALK)gene  translocation. Targeted therapies for lung cancers ""addicted"" to other driver  gene mutations including ROS1, RET or HER2 are also under development. Through  these personalized approaches, lung cancer is changing from an acute fatal  disease to a more chronic disease, and eventually we might be able to cure it.', 'Somatic mutations in the tyrosine kinase (TK) domain of the epidermal growth  factor receptor (EGFR) gene are reportedly associated with sensitivity of lung  cancers to gefitinib (Iressa), kinase inhibitor. In-frame deletions occur in  exon 19, whereas point mutations occur frequently in codon 858 (exon 21). We  found from sequencing the EGFR TK domain that 7 of 10 gefitinib-sensitive tumors  had similar types of alterations; no mutations were found in eight  gefitinib-refractory tumors (P = 0.004). Five of seven tumors sensitive to  erlotinib (Tarceva), a related kinase inhibitor for which the clinically  relevant target is undocumented, had analogous somatic mutations, as opposed to  none of 10 erlotinib-refractory tumors (P = 0.003). Because most  mutation-positive tumors were adenocarcinomas from patients who smoked <100  cigarettes in a lifetime (""never smokers""), we screened EGFR exons 2-28 in 15  adenocarcinomas resected from untreated never smokers. Seven tumors had TK  domain mutations, in contrast to 4 of 81 non-small cell lung cancers resected  from untreated former or current smokers (P = 0.0001). Immunoblotting of lysates  from cells transiently transfected with various EGFR constructs demonstrated  that, compared to wild-type protein, an exon 19 deletion mutant induced  diminished levels of phosphotyrosine, whereas the phosphorylation at tyrosine  1092 of an exon 21 point mutant was inhibited at 10-fold lower concentrations of  drug. Collectively, these data show that adenocarcinomas from never smokers  comprise a distinct subset of lung cancers, frequently containing mutations  within the TK domain of EGFR that are associated with gefitinib and erlotinib  sensitivity.', 'The development of resistance to epidermal growth factor receptor tyrosine  kinase inhibitors (EGFR-TKI) seems almost inevitable, even in patients with lung  cancer that initially respond well to EGFR-TKIs. MET amplification was recently  found to be a mechanism of escape from the anticancer effect of EGFR inhibitors.  In the present study, we investigated the means whereby MET affects sensitivity  to EGFR-TKIs in PC-9 cells. Gefitinib- or erlotinib-resistant sublines were  established by exposing the parental PC-9 cell line to chronic, repeated  treatments with these drugs. These resistant sublines showed more than 100-fold  more resistance to gefitinib and erlotinib and acquired cross-resistance to  other EGFR-TKIs. The T790M EGFR mutation was found by pyrosequencing, and this  seemed to be the cause of drug resistance. Resistant cells also showed MET  activation, although gene amplification was not detected. Furthermore, the  induction of MET activity was not found to be associated with sensitivity to  EGFR-TKIs. Interestingly, increased passage number without exposure to gefitinib  or erlotinib caused MET activation, but this did not affect sensitivity to  EGFR-TKIs. In addition, hepatocyte growth factor was found to block the ability  of EGFR-TKIs to inhibit MET activation. However, sustained MET activation by  hepatocyte growth factor did not modulate the cellular effects of gefitinib or  erlotinib. Rather, activated MET enhanced migration and invasion abilities.  Summarizing, MET activation may be acquired during cancer cell proliferation and  enhances migratory and invasive abilities without affecting cellular sensitivity  to EGFR-TKIs. Accordingly, the present study suggests that MET activation caused  by factors other than MET gene amplification is not a suitable surrogate marker  of resistance to EGFR-TKIs.', 'Somatic mutations in exons encoding the tyrosine kinase domain of the epidermal  growth factor receptor (EGFR) gene are found in human lung adenocarcinomas and  are associated with sensitivity to the tyrosine kinase inhibitors gefitinib and  erlotinib. Nearly 90% of the EGFR mutations are either short, in-frame deletions  in exon 19 or point mutations that result in substitution of arginine for  leucine at amino acid 858 (L858R). To study further the role of these mutations  in the initiation and maintenance of lung cancer, we have developed transgenic  mice that express an exon 19 deletion mutant (EGFR(DeltaL747-S752)) or the L858R  mutant (EGFR(L858R)) in type II pneumocytes under the control of doxycycline.  Expression of either EGFR mutant leads to the development of lung  adenocarcinomas. Two weeks after induction with doxycycline, mice that express  the EGFR(L858R) allele show diffuse lung cancer highly reminiscent of human  bronchioloalveolar carcinoma and later develop interspersed multifocal  adenocarcinomas. In contrast, mice expressing EGFR(DeltaL747-S752) develop  multifocal tumors embedded in normal lung parenchyma with a longer latency. With  mice carrying either EGFR allele, withdrawal of doxycycline (to reduce  expression of the transgene) or treatment with erlotinib (to inhibit kinase  activity) causes rapid tumor regression, as assessed by magnetic resonance  imaging and histopathology, demonstrating that mutant EGFR is required for tumor  maintenance. These models may be useful for developing improved therapies for  patients with lung cancers bearing EGFR mutations.', 'Epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) tyrosine kinase inhibitors (TKIs) such  as gefitinib and erlotinib are promising therapies for patients with advanced  non-small-cell lung cancer (NSCLC). Patients with somatic activating mutations  in the EGFR gene have dramatic response initially, but would eventually develop  resistance to these TKIs. Subsequent studies found that a secondary mutation in  the EGFR gene (T790M mutation) and amplification of the MET proto-oncogene could  be the main resistance mechanisms involved. The current review is focused on  T790M, which is thought to cause steric hindrance and impair the binding of  gefitinib/erlotinib. The T790M is present as a minor allele before TKI therapy  and accounts for about half of the acquired resistant cases. Conflicting results  were reported for gefitinib-resistant, T790M-acquired patients who had switched  to erlotinib treatment, which was proposed to be efficacious. The switch therapy  was presumed to work for EGFR wild type patients and previously gefitinib  responding patients. MET amplification accounts for about 20% of TKI  acquired-resistant patients by a different molecular pathway from T790M; some of  these patients will also concurrently have T790M mutation and might still not  respond to irreversible TKI. As for the detection of T790M, polymerase chain  reaction (PCR), especially mutant-enriched PCR was found to be more sensitive  than direct DNA sequencing. In addition, whole genome amplification might also  be useful and can be incorporated with future noninvasive method for detecting  T790M. A better understanding of the mechanisms leading to TKI resistance is  crucial in the development of effective treatment and the design of future  clinical studies.', 'Mutations in the epidermal growth factor receptor gene (EGFR) are frequently  observed in non-small-cell lung cancer (NSCLC), occurring in about 40% to 60% of  never-smokers and in about 17% of patients with adenocarcinomas. EGFR tyrosine  kinase inhibitors (TKIs), such as gefitinib and erlotinib, have transformed  therapy for patients with EGFR-mutant NSCLC and have proved superior to  chemotherapy as first-line treatment for this patient group. Despite these  benefits, there are currently 2 key challenges associated with EGFR inhibitor  therapy for patients with NSCLC. First, only 85% to 90% of patients with the  EGFR mutation derive clinical benefit from EGFR TKIs, with the remainder  demonstrating innate resistance to therapy. Second, acquired resistance to EGFR  TKIs inevitably occurs in patients who initially respond to therapy, with a  median duration of response of about 10 months. Mutant EGFR activates various  subcellular signaling cascades, including the phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase  (PI3K)/Akt/mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR) pathway, which demonstrates  maintained activity in a variety of TKI-resistant cancers. Given the fundamental  role of the PI3K/Akt/mTOR pathway in tumor oncogenesis, proliferation, and  survival, PI3K pathway inhibitors have emerged as a possible solution to the  problem of EGFR TKI resistance. However resistance to EGFR TKIs is associated  with considerable heterogeneity and complexity. Preclinical experiments  investigating these phenomena suggest that in some patients, PI3K inhibitors  will have to be paired with other targeted agents if they are to be effective.  This review discusses the preclinical data supporting PI3K/Akt/mTOR pathway  inhibitor combinations in EGFR TKI-resistant NSCLC from the perspective of the  various agents currently being investigated in clinical trials.', 'The development of resistance to epidermal growth factor receptor tyrosine  kinase inhibitors (EGFR-TKI) seems almost inevitable, even in patients with lung  cancer that initially respond well to EGFR-TKIs. MET amplification was recently  found to be a mechanism of escape from the anticancer effect of EGFR inhibitors.  In the present study, we investigated the means whereby MET affects sensitivity  to EGFR-TKIs in PC-9 cells. Gefitinib- or erlotinib-resistant sublines were  established by exposing the parental PC-9 cell line to chronic, repeated  treatments with these drugs. These resistant sublines showed more than 100-fold  more resistance to gefitinib and erlotinib and acquired cross-resistance to  other EGFR-TKIs. The T790M EGFR mutation was found by pyrosequencing, and this  seemed to be the cause of drug resistance. Resistant cells also showed MET  activation, although gene amplification was not detected. Furthermore, the  induction of MET activity was not found to be associated with sensitivity to  EGFR-TKIs. Interestingly, increased passage number without exposure to gefitinib  or erlotinib caused MET activation, but this did not affect sensitivity to  EGFR-TKIs. In addition, hepatocyte growth factor was found to block the ability  of EGFR-TKIs to inhibit MET activation. However, sustained MET activation by  hepatocyte growth factor did not modulate the cellular effects of gefitinib or  erlotinib. Rather, activated MET enhanced migration and invasion abilities.  Summarizing, MET activation may be acquired during cancer cell proliferation and  enhances migratory and invasive abilities without affecting cellular sensitivity  to EGFR-TKIs. Accordingly, the present study suggests that MET activation caused  by factors other than MET gene amplification is not a suitable surrogate marker  of resistance to EGFR-TKIs.', 'PURPOSE: Several cases have been reported in which central nervous system (CNS)  metastases of non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) resistant to gefitinib were  improved by erlotinib. However, there has been no study in which cerebrospinal  fluid (CSF) concentrations of gefitinib and erlotinib are directly compared.  Thus, we aimed to compare them. METHODS: We examined 15 Japanese patients with NSCLC and CNS metastases with  epidermal growth factor receptor gene mutations who received CSF examinations  during epidermal growth factor receptor-tyrosine kinase inhibitors treatment  (250 mg daily gefitinib or 150 mg daily erlotinib). Plasma and CSF  concentrations were determined using high-performance liquid chromatography with  tandem mass spectrometry. RESULTS: The concentration and penetration rate of gefitinib (mean ± standard  deviation) in the CSF were 3.7 ± 1.9 ng/mL (8.2 ± 4.3 nM) and 1.13 ± 0.36 %,  respectively. The concentration and penetration rate of erlotinib in the CSF  were 28.7 ± 16.8 ng/mL (66.9 ± 39.0 nM) and 2.77 ± 0.45 %, respectively. The CSF  concentration and penetration rate of erlotinib were significantly higher than  those of gefitinib (P = 0.0008 and <0.0001, respectively). The CNS response  rates of patients with erlotinib treatment were preferentially (but not  significantly) higher than those with gefitinib treatment. (1/3 vs. 4/7,  respectively). Leptomeningeal metastases in one patient, which were refractory  to gefitinib, dramatically responded to erlotinib. CONCLUSIONS: This study suggested that higher CSF concentration could be  achieved with erlotinib and that erlotinib could be more effective for the  treatment for CNS metastases, especially leptomeningeal metastases, than  gefitinib.', 'BACKGROUND: Epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) and its downstream factors  KRAS and BRAF are mutated in several types of cancer, affecting the clinical  response to EGFR inhibitors. Mutations in the EGFR kinase domain predict  sensitivity to the tyrosine kinase inhibitors gefitinib and erlotinib in lung  adenocarcinoma, while activating point mutations in KRAS and BRAF confer  resistance to the anti-EGFR monoclonal antibody cetuximab in colorectal cancer.  The development of new generation methods for systematic mutation screening of  these genes will allow more appropriate therapeutic choices. METHODS: We describe a high resolution melting (HRM) assay for mutation  detection in EGFR exons 19-21, KRAS codon 12/13 and BRAF V600 using  formalin-fixed paraffin-embedded samples. Somatic variation of KRAS exon 2 was  also analysed by massively parallel pyrosequencing of amplicons with the GS  Junior 454 platform. RESULTS: We tested 120 routine diagnostic specimens from patients with  colorectal or lung cancer. Mutations in KRAS, BRAF and EGFR were observed in  41.9%, 13.0% and 11.1% of the overall samples, respectively, being mutually  exclusive. For KRAS, six types of substitutions were detected (17 G12D, 9 G13D,  7 G12C, 2 G12A, 2 G12V, 2 G12S), while V600E accounted for all the BRAF  activating mutations. Regarding EGFR, two cases showed exon 19 deletions  (delE746-A750 and delE746-T751insA) and another two substitutions in exon 21  (one showed L858R with the resistance mutation T590M in exon 20, and the other  had P848L mutation). Consistent with earlier reports, our results show that KRAS  and BRAF mutation frequencies in colorectal cancer were 44.3% and 13.0%,  respectively, while EGFR mutations were detected in 11.1% of the lung cancer  specimens. Ultra-deep amplicon pyrosequencing successfully validated the HRM  results and allowed detection and quantitation of KRAS somatic mutations. CONCLUSIONS: HRM is a rapid and sensitive method for moderate-throughput  cost-effective screening of oncogene mutations in clinical samples. Rather than  Sanger sequence validation, next-generation sequencing technology results in  more accurate quantitative results in somatic variation and can be achieved at a  higher throughput scale.', 'Mutations in the tyrosine kinase (TK) domain of the epidermal growth factor  receptor (EGFR) gene in non-small cell lung cancers are associated with  increased sensitivity of these cancers to drugs that inhibit EGFR kinase  activity such as gefitinib and erlotinib. Responses to TK inhibitors in the  absence of EGFR gene mutation for BAC patients have not been reported. A case of  a patient with BAC refractory to chemotherapy who responded to gefitinib in the  absence of EGFR gene mutations is reported. Tyrosine kinase inhibitors may have  a role in BAC in the absence of EGFR gene mutations. Additional studies on other  molecular alterations of the EGFR family members are needed to better predict  response to these agents.']","Patients who carry somatic activating mutations in the tyrosine kinase domain of the epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) gene, respond well to erlotinib and gefitinib."
152,Is indicated the use of antioxidant supplements in patients at risk for coronary artery disease?,"['This review summarizes the scientific evidence for a possible role of  antioxidants in the prevention of coronary heart disease (CHD). Dietary  antioxidants include vitamin E, vitamin C and beta-carotene, whereas selenium is  an integral part of the antioxidant enzyme glutathione peroxidase. Experimental  studies suggest that the oxidation of low-density lipoproteins (LDL) in the  vessel wall plays an important role in the development of atherosclerotic  lesions. The resistance of LDL to oxidation is increased by antioxidant  supplementation, at least in vitro. Epidemiological studies have not  demonstrated unequivocally that a high intake of antioxidants leads to a  decreased risk of CHD. Studies on dietary intake and serum levels of  antioxidants do point in the direction of a preventive effect of antioxidants,  whereas the results of intervention studies are less conclusive. Beta-carotene  supplementation is not associated with any decrease in CHD; high doses of  vitamin E may be beneficial, but results from large trials are to be awaited.  General preventive measures based on antioxidant supplementation are not yet  justifiable.', 'Supplementation with antioxidants and its benefit-risk relationship have been  largely discussed in the elderly population. We evaluated whether antioxidants  supplementation improved the biochemical profile associated with oxidative  metabolism in elderly cardiovascular patients. Patients (n = 112) received daily  supplementation with α-TP 400\u2009mg, beta-carotene 40\u2009mg, and vitamin C 1000\u2009mg for  2 months (treatment). Plasma concentrations of alpha-tocopherol (α-TP),  β-carotene (βC), ubiquinol-10 (QH-10), glutathione, and thiobarbituric acid  reactive substances (TBARS) were determined before and after treatment. Response  to treatment was dependent on pretreatment α-TP and βC levels. Increase in α-TP  and βC levels was observed only in patients with basal levels <18\u2009 μM for α-TP  (P < 0.01) and <0.30\u2009 μM for βC (P < 0.02). Ubiquinol-10, glutathione, and TBARS  were unaffected by treatment: QH-10 (+57%, F(1,110) = 3.611, P < 0.06, and  N.S.), glutathione (+21%, F(1,110) = 2.92, P < 0.09, and N.S.), and TBARS (-29%,  F(1,110) = 2.26, P < 0.14, and N.S.). Treatment reduced oxidative metabolism:  5.3% versus 14.6% basal value (F(1,110) = 9.21, P < 0.0003). Basal TBARS/α-TP  ratio was higher in smokers compared to nonsmokers: 0.11 ± 0.02 versus 0.06 ±  0.01 (F(32,80) = 1.63, P < 0.04). Response to antioxidant supplementation was  dependent on basal plasma levels of α-TP and βC. Smoking status was strongly  associated with atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease and high TBARS/α-TP ratio  (lipid peroxidation).', 'Cardiovascular disease (CVD), particularly in the form of coronary artery  disease, is the leading cause of death in the United States. Research in the  past 10 years links pathogenic low-density lipoprotein (LDL) modification to  oxidation damage by free radicals. This review summarizes the major findings of  CVD-related epidemiologic research and clinical trials conducted in the past 5  years on vitamins A, C, and E. Vitamin supplementation behaviors are discussed.  In prospective studies, the intake of vitamins A, C, and E has been correlated  with lower mortality rates. When recent clinical trials and oxidation studies  are analyzed, the weight of evidence suggests that 100-400 IU of daily vitamin E  over 2 years or more may be most efficacious in reducing low-density lipoprotein  oxidation and positively influencing mortality rates from CVD in primary care.  Research also supports vitamin E supplementation in patients with known CAD or a  history of transient ischemic attacks. Persons with diabetes or hypertension as  well as smokers may benefit from supplemental vitamin C intake. Targeted  antioxidant vitamin intake should be included in CVD risk assessment and primary  preventive counseling efforts.', 'BACKGROUND: Although basic research suggests that vitamins may have an important  role in the prevention of cardiovascular diseases (CVD), the data from cohort  studies and clinical trials are inconclusive. METHODS: This prospective cohort study was conducted among 83 639 male  physicians residing in the United States who had no history of CVD or cancer. At  baseline, data on use of vitamin E, ascorbic acid (vitamin C), and multivitamin  supplements were provided by a self-administered questionnaire. Mortality from  CVD and coronary heart disease (CHD) was assessed by death certificate review. RESULTS: Use of supplements was reported by 29% of the participants. During a  mean follow-up of 5.5 years, 1037 CVD deaths occurred, including 608 CHD deaths.  After adjustment for several cardiovascular risk factors, supplement use was not  significantly associated with total CVD or CHD mortality. For vitamin E use, the  relative risks (RRs) were 0.92 (95% confidence interval [CI], 0.70-1.21) for  total CVD mortality and 0.88 (95% CI, 0.61-1.27) for CHD mortality; for use of  vitamin C, the RRs were 0.88 (95% CI, 0.70-1.12) for total CVD mortality and  0.86 (95% CI, 0.63-1.18) for CHD mortality; and for use of multivitamin  supplements, the RRs were 1.07 (95% CI, 0.91-1.25) for total CVD mortality and  1.02 (95% CI, 0.83-1.25) for CHD mortality. CONCLUSIONS: In this large cohort of apparently healthy US male physicians,  self-selected supplementation with vitamin E, vitamin C, or multivitamins was  not associated with a significant decrease in total CVD or CHD mortality. Data  from ongoing large randomized trials will be necessary to definitely establish  small potential benefits of vitamin supplements on subsequent cardiovascular  risk.', 'Decreased antioxidant-vitamin nutritional status may increase lipid peroxidation  and susceptibility of low-density lipoprotein (LDL) to oxidative modification.  The aim of this study was to evaluate the vitamin nutritional status of coronary  artery disease (CAD) patients and to assess the risk of CAD related to each  individual antioxidant vitamin. The study was performed as a case-control study  with 41 patients with angiographically demonstrated CAD and 41 apparently  healthy age- and smoking status-matched controls. Plasma vitamin E, C and A  concentrations were significantly decreased in CAD patients compared with  controls (p < 0.001) after correcting for significant covariates. Per quartile  decrease in vitamin A and E concentrations was associated with increased risk of  CAD, even after adjusting for CAD risk factors, while per quartile decrease in  vitamin C concentrations was not associated with significant CAD risk after  adjusting for CAD risk factors. Decreased vitamin A and E concentrations are  independently associated with increased risk of CAD independent from other CAD  risk factors in white male South Africans and dietary intervention strategies  are advocated.', 'In recent years, vitamin E has been investigated as a cardioprotective agent.  Experimental studies have identified potential mechanisms by which vitamin E may  inhibit the development of atherosclerosis, and observational studies of  individuals without coronary disease suggest that vitamin E intake may prevent  future cardiovascular events. Secondary prevention trials to date have  demonstrated little benefit from vitamin E supplementation. It remains possible,  however, that supplementation may be useful among certain high-risk groups,  including those with nutritional deficiencies. Limited data from completed  primary prevention trials also indicate minimal cardioprotection from vitamin E,  but large-scale trials now in progress may yet show benefit. Results from  ongoing trials will contribute powerfully to the totality of evidence on which  to formulate both appropriate clinical recommendations for individual patients  and a rational public health policy for the population as a whole. At this time,  there is insufficient evidence for issuing a public health recommendation to use  vitamin E supplements to prevent cardiovascular disease (CVD). Rather, increased  intake of fruits, vegetables, and other antioxidant-rich foods should be  promoted as part of a healthy diet because they provide nutritional benefits  beyond any potential antioxidant effect. Moreover, even if found to reduce CVD  risk, vitamin supplement use should be considered an adjunct, not an  alternative, to established cardioprotective measures, such as smoking  abstention, avoidance of obesity, adequate physical activity, and control of  high blood pressure and hyperlipidemia.', 'BACKGROUND: Many epidemiological studies have reported that antioxidant vitamin  intake from diet or supplements are associated with a lower risk of coronary  heart disease (CHD), the findings are, however, inconsistent. We undertook a  meta-analysis of cohort studies to examine the relations between antioxidant  vitamins (vitamins C, E, and beta-carotene) and CHD risk. METHODS AND RESULTS: We included all the relevant cohort studies if they  provided a relative risk and corresponding 95% confidence interval (CI) of CHD  in relation to antioxidant vitamins intake from diet or supplement. Fifteen  cohort studies were identified involving a total of 7415 incident CHD cases and  374,488 participants with a median follow-up of approximately 10, 8.5, and 15  years for vitamins C, E, and beta-carotene, respectively. Pooled estimates  across studies were obtained by random-effects model. The potential sources of  heterogeneity and publication bias were also estimated. For vitamins C, E, and  beta-carotene, a comparison of individuals in the top third with those in the  bottom third of baseline value yielded a combined relative risk of 0.84 (95% CI,  0.73-0.95), 0.76 (95% CI, 0.63-0.89), and 0.78 (95% CI, 0.53-1.04),  respectively. Subgroup analyses show that dietary intake of vitamins C and E and  supplement use of vitamin E have an inverse association with CHD risk, but  supplement use of vitamin C has no significant association with CHD risk. In the  dose-response meta-analysis, each 30 mg/day increase in vitamin C, 30 IU/day  increase in vitamin E, and 1 mg/day increase in beta-carotene yielded the  estimated overall relative risk for CHD of 1.01 (95% CI, 0.99-1.02), 0.96 (95%  CI, 0.94-0.99), and 1.00 (95% CI, 0.88-1.14), respectively. CONCLUSIONS: Our findings in this meta-analysis suggest that an increase in  dietary intake of antioxidant vitamins has encouraging prospects for possible  CHD prevention.', 'The emerging dogma that low density lipoprotein (LDL) oxidation is a  contributing cause and not simply a consequence of atherosclerosis is based on  three lines of experimental evidence: (i) lipid peroxidation products and  oxidized LDLs are present in atherosclerotic lesions; (ii) oxidized LDL has an  array of potentially proatherogenic properties in vitro, including uptake by  macrophages via a number of distinct ""scavenger"" receptors; and (iii) treatment  of hypercholesterolemic animals with potent antioxidant drugs can retard the  development of atherosclerosis. Additional support for the role of lipoprotein  oxidation in atherogenesis was provided by cross-cultural dietary comparisons,  which suggested an inverse correlation between antioxidant vitamin intake and  coronary mortality. As well, several large case-control studies indicated that  antioxidant vitamin intake, particularly vitamin E, was associated with reduced  coronary risk. However, these studies do not indicate whether this association  is causal, or if vitamin supplementation is merely a marker for some other  protective factor. To test this properly, randomized controlled intervention  studies are required. In several animal models, a number of different  antioxidant drugs have been shown to retard atherosclerosis, but results with  vitamin supplementation are unclear. Results of intervention trials in humans  show no benefit to long-term beta-carotene supplementation, and the only  published study of vitamin E found a reduction of nonfatal myocardial infarction  but no reduction (actually an increase) in fatal myocardial infarction and total  mortality. Several other large antioxidant intervention trials are underway.  Until the results of these studies are available, there appears to be  insufficient evidence on which to base recommendations regarding antioxidant  supplements for the prevention of atherosclerosis.', 'Lipid peroxidation is thought to be one of the major factors involved in  atherogenesis. There is an increasing evidence is increasing that oxidation of  LDL cholesterol may be instrumental in atherogenesis. Diabetics are known to be  at increased risk of cardiovascular diseases, a phenomenon which has previously  been linked to the lipid peroxidation process. As a result, a number of studies  have been undertaken to evaluate the effects of antioxidant vitamins on coronary  heart disease and risks factors of ischaemic heart disease such as diabetes  mellitus. Lipid peroxidation and antioxidant status were studied in 51 patients  with ischaemic heart disease and some of with having diabetes mellitus (18%).  Results were compared before and after supplementation of 450 mg of tocopherol  acetate for three months. SOD were found to be elevated in patients with  diabetes and in whole groups of patients after supplementation of tocopherol  acetate. Also, TAS was found to be elevated in a subgroup of patients without  diabetes and no significant changes were found in glutathion-peroxidase after  supplementation. We found statistically significantly decreased mean values of  glucose after supplementation in all groups of patients. The monitoring of  antioxidant parameters in diabetic patients could be of vital importance in the  study of the disease.', 'This review briefly summarizes the scientific evidence for a possible role of  antioxidants in the prevention of coronary heart disease (CHD). Antioxidants in  our diet include vitamins E, C, and beta-carotene, whereas selenium is an  integral part of the antioxidant enzyme glutathione peroxidase (GSHPx).  Experimental evidence suggests that free-radical damage and antioxidant defence  may play an important role in the development of coronary heart disease.  Epidemiological studies have produced some intriguing results, but have not  indicated unequivocally that a high intake of antioxidants leads to a decreased  cardiovascular disease risk. We conclude that the antioxidant atherosclerosis  hypothesis is promising, but that the results of long-term intervention studies  are still to be awaited. Preventive action based on antioxidant supplementation  is therefore not justifiable as yet. Nevertheless, the findings so far certainly  do support the recommendations for a varied diet rich in vegetables and fruit.']","antioxidant supplementation 
However there are no clear evidencies on the clinical and prognostic benefit of this supplementation. 
Currently there areno recommendation for the antioxidant therapy in patients with coronary artery disease.

153,Which mutations of phopspholamban have been found in patients with cardiomyopathy?,"['Depressed Ca-handling in cardiomyocytes is frequently attributed to impaired  sarcoplasmic reticulum (SR) function in human and experimental heart failure.  Phospholamban (PLN) is a key regulator of SR and cardiac function, and PLN  mutations in humans have been associated with dilated cardiomyopathy (DCM). We  previously reported the deletion of the highly conserved amino acid residue  arginine 14 (nucleic acids 39, 40 and 41) in DCM patients. This basic amino acid  is important in maintaining the upstream consensus sequence for PKA  phosphorylation of Ser 16 in PLN. To assess the function of this mutant PLN, we  introduced the PLN-R14Del in cardiac myocytes of the PLN null mouse. Transgenic  lines expressing mutant PLN-R14Del at similar protein levels to wild types  exhibited no inhibition of the initial rates of oxalate-facilitated SR Ca uptake  compared to PLN-knockouts (PLN-KO). The contractile parameters and Ca-kinetics  also remained highly stimulated in PLN-R14Del cardiomyocytes, similar to PLN-KO,  and isoproterenol did not further stimulate these hyper-contractile basal  parameters. Consistent with the lack of inhibition on SR Ca-transport and  contractility, confocal microscopy indicated that the PLN-R14Del failed to  co-localize with SERCA2a. Moreover, PLN-R14Del did not co-immunoprecipitate with  SERCA2a (as did WT-PLN), but rather co-immunoprecipitated with the sarcolemmal  Na/K-ATPase (NKA) and stimulated NKA activity. In addition, studies in HEK cells  indicated significant fluorescence resonance energy transfer between  PLN-R14Del-YFP and NKAα1-CFP, but not with the NKA regulator phospholemman.  Despite the enhanced cardiac function in PLN-R14Del hearts (as in  PLN-knockouts), there was cardiac hypertrophy (unlike PLN-KO) coupled with  activation of Akt and the MAPK pathways. Thus, human PLN-R14Del is misrouted to  the sarcolemma, in the absence of endogenous PLN, and alters NKA activity,  leading to cardiac remodeling.', 'Molecular etiologies of heart failure, an emerging cardiovascular epidemic  affecting 4.7 million Americans and costing 17.8 billion health-care dollars  annually, remain poorly understood. Here we report that an inherited human  dilated cardiomyopathy with refractory congestive heart failure is caused by a  dominant Arg --> Cys missense mutation at residue 9 (R9C) in phospholamban  (PLN), a transmembrane phosphoprotein that inhibits the cardiac sarcoplasmic  reticular Ca2+-adenosine triphosphatase (SERCA2a) pump. Transgenic PLN(R9C) mice  recapitulated human heart failure with premature death. Cellular and biochemical  studies revealed that, unlike wild-type PLN, PLN(R9C) did not directly inhibit  SERCA2a. Rather, PLN(R9C) trapped protein kinase A (PKA), which blocked  PKA-mediated phosphorylation of wild-type PLN and in turn delayed decay of  calcium transients in myocytes. These results indicate that myocellular calcium  dysregulation can initiate human heart failure-a finding that may lead to  therapeutic opportunities.', 'BACKGROUND: Phospholamban is an endogenous sarcoplasmic reticulum calcium ATPase  inhibitor with a regulatory effect on cardiac contraction/relaxation coupling.  Mutations in the phospholamban gene (PLN) have been associated with primary  cardiomyopathies. AIMS: To screen for PLN mutations in our population of patients with primary  cardiomyopathies and to perform functional analysis of the mutations identified. METHODS: We performed SSCP mutational screening and DNA sequencing of the PLN  gene in 186 patients with either hypertrophic or dilated cardiomyopathy. To  study promoter strength we constructed reporter plasmids containing the  luciferase gene and performed transient transfection analysis in C6 and C2C12  cell lines. RESULTS: The PLN -42 C>G mutation was found in one patient with late onset  familial apical hypertrophic cardiomyopathy. This mutation decreased  phospholamban promoter activity by 43% and 47%, in C6 and C2C12 cell lines  respectively. One son had mild apical hypertrophic cardiomyopathy and carried  the mutation, another son with normal ECG and echocardiogram also had the  mutation. CONCLUSION: The PLN -42 C>G mutation is associated with a benign form of apical  hypertrophic cardiomyopathy in this family, though the presence of a healthy  adult carrier suggests that other genetic and environmental factors could be  involved. Otherwise, mutations in the PLN gene are not a frequent cause of  cardiomyopathies in our population.', 'The sarcoplasmic reticulum calcium pump (SERCA) and its regulator,  phospholamban, are essential components of cardiac contractility. Phospholamban  modulates contractility by inhibiting SERCA, and this process is dynamically  regulated by β-adrenergic stimulation and phosphorylation of phospholamban.  Herein we reveal mechanistic insight into how four hereditary mutants of  phospholamban, Arg(9) to Cys, Arg(9) to Leu, Arg(9) to His, and Arg(14)  deletion, alter regulation of SERCA. Deletion of Arg(14) disrupts the protein  kinase A recognition motif, which abrogates phospholamban phosphorylation and  results in constitutive SERCA inhibition. Mutation of Arg(9) causes more complex  changes in function, where hydrophobic substitutions such as cysteine and  leucine eliminate both SERCA inhibition and phospholamban phosphorylation,  whereas an aromatic substitution such as histidine selectively disrupts  phosphorylation. We demonstrate that the role of Arg(9) in phospholamban  function is multifaceted: it is important for inhibition of SERCA, it increases  the efficiency of phosphorylation, and it is critical for protein kinase A  recognition in the context of the phospholamban pentamer. Given the synergistic  consequences on contractility, it is not surprising that the mutants cause  lethal, hereditary dilated cardiomyopathy.', 'OBJECTIVES: The purpose of this research was to determine the phenotypic  spectrum associated with phospholamban gene (PLN) mutations. BACKGROUND: Inheritance contributes to the development of dilated  cardiomyopathy. Mutations in the gene encoding PLN have been associated with  dilated cardiomyopathy characterized by early onset and the presence of lethal  ventricular arrhythmias. METHODS: We screened a cohort of 260 unrelated dilated cardiomyopathy patients  from a tertiary care referral center for mutations in the PLN gene. RESULTS: Family history of cardiomyopathy was present in approximately one-half  the individuals in this cohort. We identified 1 family with a deletion of  arginine 14 in the PLN. Interestingly, unlike other individuals reported with  the identical PLN mutation, these individuals were not diagnosed with dilated  cardiomyopathy until their seventh decade when they were only mildly symptomatic  with congestive heart failure. CONCLUSIONS: The identical PLN mutation can be associated with both mild and  severe forms of dilated cardiomyopathy. Additionally, PLN mutations should be  considered in late onset cardiomyopathy.

Dysfunctions in SERCA:PLN interactions have been  implicated as having a critical role in cardiac disease, and targeting Ca(2+)  transport has been demonstrated to be a promising avenue in treating conditions  of heart failure. Here, we designed a series of new mutants able to tune SERCA  function, targeting the loop sequence that connects the transmembrane and  cytoplasmic helices of PLN. We found that a variable degree of loss of  inhibition mutants is attainable by engineering glycine mutations along PLN's  loop domain. Remarkably, a double glycine mutation results in a complete  loss-of-function mutant, fully mimicking the phosphorylated state of PLN. Using  nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy, we rationalized the effects of these  mutations in terms of entropic control on PLN function, whose inhibitory  function can be modulated by increasing its conformational dynamics. However, if  PLN mutations go past a threshold set by the phosphorylated state, they break  the structural coupling between the transmembrane and cytoplasmic domains,  resulting in a species that behaves as the inhibitory transmembrane domain  alone.

Through  genetic screening of dilated cardiomyopathy patients, we identified a previously  uncharacterized deletion of arginine 14 (PLN-R14Del) in the coding region of the  phospholamban (PLN) gene in a large family with hereditary heart failure. No  homozygous individuals were identified. By middle age, heterozygous individuals  developed left ventricular dilation, contractile dysfunction, and episodic  ventricular arrhythmias, with overt heart failure in some cases. Transgenic mice  overexpressing the mutant PLN-R14Del recapitulated human cardiomyopathy  exhibiting similar histopathologic abnormalities and premature death.  Coexpression of the normal and mutant-PLN in HEK-293 cells resulted in  sarcoplasmic reticulum Ca(2+)-ATPase superinhibition. The dominant effect of the  PLN-R14Del mutation could not be fully removed, even upon phosphorylation by  protein kinase A. Thus, by chronic suppression of sarcoplasmic reticulum  Ca(2+)-ATPase activity, the nonreversible superinhibitory function of mutant  PLN-R14Del may lead to inherited dilated cardiomyopathy and premature death in  both humans and mice.', 'Dilated cardiomyopathy and end-stage heart failure result in multiple defects in  cardiac excitation-contraction coupling.

Chem. 272,  15061-15064), gain of function in PLN transmembrane domain II mutants was  correlated with pentamer destabilization, leading to proposals that the PLN  monomer is the active inhibitory species, that dissociation of the PLN pentamer  is one determinant of PLN inhibitory function and that dissociation of the  PLN.cardiac sarco(endo)plasmic Ca2+-ATPase isoform (SERCA2a) complex is a second  determinant. Because each of the new domain Ib mutants contained a normal ratio  of pentamer to monomer in SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis, gain of  function must have resulted from mechanisms other than destabilization of  pentameric structure. Evidence that domain Ib and domain II mutants act through  different sites and different mechanisms was provided by a monomeric double  mutant, N30A/I40A, in which the enhanced inhibitory function of each single  mutant was additive. Evidence for an alteration in stability of the PLN/SERCA2a  heterodimer was obtained in a study of double mutant N27A/N34A in which  inhibitory function was regained by combining a gain of function, domain Ib  mutation with a loss of function domain II mutation. These results support the  proposal that PLN inhibition of SERCA2a involves, first, depolymerization of PLN  and, second, the formation of inhibitory interactions between monomeric PLN and  SERCA2a.']","PLN mutation R14del [or c.40_42delAGA(p.Arg14del)] was identified in 12 (12 %) ARVC patients and in 39 (15 %) DCM patients. Another PLN mutation is a T116G point mutation, substituting a termination codon for Leu-39 (L39stop), and it was identified in two families with hereditary heart failure. Hereditary mutants of phospholamban, such as Arg(9) to Cys, Arg(9) to Leu, Arg(9) to His, cause lethal, hereditary dilated cardiomyopathy.in specific, two patients presented a G-T missense mutation at the G26 nucleotide, which encodes an Arg-Leu substitution at codon 9 (R9L).One patient presented a G-A missense mutation at the same nucleotide, which encodes an Arg-His substitution at codon 9 (R9H).

154,What is the name of the stem loop present in the 3' end of genes encoding for selenoproteins?,"[""The mechanisms regulating the differential selenium (Se)-dependent stability of  selenoprotein mRNAs are partially characterized. To further study the  Se-dependent regulation of selenoproteins, we developed a novel chemiluminescent  reporter to monitor the steady-state mRNA level of an artificial selenoprotein.  Our reporter is a fusion of the Renilla luciferase gene and of the β-globin  gene, but contains features required for incorporation of selenocysteine (SEC),  namely, a UGA-SEC codon and a 3' untranslated region RNA stem loop called a SEC  incorporation sequence (SECIS). At various levels of Se, the activity of  reporters containing GPX1 or GPX4 SECIS elements is proportional to the  steady-state mRNA level of the reporter construct and reflects the level of the  corresponding endogenous mRNA. In a reporter containing a UGA codon and a  functional GPX1 SECIS, Se-dependent nonsense-mediated decay (NMD) occurred in  the cytoplasm, as opposed to the more typical nuclear location. To validate the  reporter system, we used genetic and pharmacologic approaches to inhibit or  promote NMD. Modulation of UPF1 by siRNA, overexpression, or by inhibition of  SMG1 altered NMD in this system. Our reporter is derived from a Renilla  luciferase reporter gene fused to an intron containing B-globin gene and is  subject to degradation by NMD when a stop codon is inserted before the second  intron."", ""SECIS elements form stem-loop structures in the 3' untranslated regions (UTR) of  eukaryotic mRNAs that encode selenoproteins. These elements direct incorporation  of selenocysteine at UGA codons, provided the SECIS element lies a sufficient  distance from the UGA. The cDNAs encoding skeletal muscle selenoprotein W from  human, rhesus monkey, sheep, rat, and mouse contained highly similar SECIS  elements that retained important features common to all known SECIS elements.  Comparative analysis of these SECIS elements showed that in some regions both  predicted secondary structure and nucleotide sequences were conserved, in other  areas secondary structure was maintained using different primary sequence, and  in still other portions, base pairing was not conserved. The rodent and sheep  selenoprotein W mRNAs used UGA as a stop codon and as a selenocysteine codon.  Thus, UGA specified both selenocysteine incorporation and termination in a  single mRNA. The selenoprotein W SECIS elements contained an additional highly  conserved base-paired stem that may prevent inappropriate selenocysteine  incorporation at the UGA stop codons."", ""Selenoproteins are proteins containing an uncommon amino acid selenocysteine  (Sec). Sec is inserted by a specific translational machinery that recognizes a  stem-loop structure, the SECIS element, at the 3' UTR of selenoprotein genes and  recodes a UGA codon within the coding sequence. As UGA is normally a  translational stop signal, selenoproteins are generally misannotated and  designated tools have to be developed for this class of proteins. Here, we  present two new computational methods for selenoprotein identification and  analysis, which we provide publicly through the web servers at  http://gladyshevlab.org/SelenoproteinPredictionServer or  http://seblastian.crg.es. SECISearch3 replaces its predecessor SECISearch as a  tool for prediction of eukaryotic SECIS elements. Seblastian is a new method for  selenoprotein gene detection that uses SECISearch3 and then predicts  selenoprotein sequences encoded upstream of SECIS elements. Seblastian is able  to both identify known selenoproteins and predict new selenoproteins. By  applying these tools to diverse eukaryotic genomes, we provide a ranked list of  newly predicted selenoproteins together with their annotated cysteine-containing  homologues.

In mammals, this requires a dedicated machinery  comprising a stem-loop structure in the 3' UTR RNA (the SECIS element) and the  specific SECIS Binding Protein 2. In this report, disorder-prediction methods  and several biophysical techniques showed that ca. 70% of the SBP2 sequence is  disordered, whereas the RNA binding domain appears to be folded and functional.  These results are consistent with a recent report on the role of the Hsp90  chaperone for the folding of SBP2 and other functionally unrelated proteins  bearing an RNA binding domain homologous to SBP2."", ""Selenium (Se) is an essential trace element primarily found in selenoproteins as  the 21st amino acid (selenocysteine, Sec, or U).

The  availability of the Naegleria gruberi (ATCC 30224) genome sequence and the use  of this organism as a model system for the pathogenic amoeba N. fowleri allowed  us to investigate the Sec incorporation pathway in this primitive eukaryote.  Using bioinformatics tools, we identified gene sequences encoding PSTK  (O-phosphoseryl-tRNA(Sec) kinase), SepSecS  (O-phosphoseryl-tRNA:selenocysteinyl-tRNA synthase), SelD/SPS2 (selenophosphate  synthetase), EFSec (selenocysteine-specific elongation factor) and SBP (SECIS  binding protein). These findings were confirmed by RT-PCR and by sequencing. A  potential tRNA(Ser)Sec (SelC) gene and a putative selenoprotein with sequence  similarity to a mitochondrial thioredoxin reductase (TR3) were also identified.  Our results show that the selenocysteine incorporation machinery is indeed  present in N. gruberi. Interestingly, the SelD/SPS2 gene is 2214 bp in length  and contains two distinct domains.

The presence of an in-frame UGA (stop) codon  in the coding sequence of selenoprotein genes precludes their identification and  correct annotation. The in-frame UGA codons are recoded to cotranslationally  incorporate selenocysteine, a rare selenium-containing amino acid. The  development of ad hoc experimental and, more recently, computational approaches  have allowed the efficient identification and characterization of the  selenoproteomes of a growing number of species. Today, dozens of selenoprotein  families have been described and more are being discovered in recently sequenced  species, but the correct genomic annotation is not available for the majority of  these genes.

In view  of unravelling the underlying complex mechanism, we have attempted to detect  RNA-binding proteins with specificity for the SECIS element. Using mobility  shift assays, we could show that a protein, present in different types of  mammalian cell extracts, possesses the capacity of binding the SECIS element of  the selenoprotein glutathione peroxidase (GPx) mRNA. We have termed this protein  SBP, for Secis Binding Protein. Competition experiments attested that the  binding is highly specific and UV cross-linking indicated that the protein has  an apparent molecular weight in the range of 60-65 kDa. Finally, some data  suggest that the SECIS elements in the mRNAs of GPx and another selenoprotein,  type I iodothyronine 5' deiodinase, recognize the same SBP protein.

In order to synthesize  selenoproteins, a translational reprogramming event must occur since Sec is  encoded by the UGA stop codon. In mammals, the recoding of UGA as Sec depends on  the selenocysteine insertion sequence (SECIS) element, a stem-loop structure in  the 3' untranslated region of the transcript. The SECIS acts as a platform for  RNA-binding proteins, which mediate or regulate the recoding mechanism. Using UV  crosslinking, we identified a 110 kDa protein, which binds with high affinity to  SECIS elements from a subset of selenoprotein mRNAs. The crosslinking activity  was purified by RNA affinity chromatography and identified as nucleolin by mass  spectrometry analysis. In vitro binding assays showed that purified nucleolin  discriminates among SECIS elements in the absence of other factors. Based on  siRNA experiments, nucleolin is required for the optimal expression of certain  selenoproteins. There was a good correlation between the affinity of nucleolin  for a SECIS and its effect on selenoprotein expression.

Application of this method to human and fugu genomes identified a novel  selenoprotein family, named SelU, in the puffer fish. The  selenocysteine-containing form also occurred in other fish, chicken, sea urchin,  green algae and diatoms. In contrast, mammals, worms and land plants contained  cysteine homologues. We demonstrated selenium incorporation into chicken SelU  and characterized the SelU expression pattern in zebrafish embryos.

155,Describe Mozart effect.,"['OBJECTIVE: Listening to Mozart K.448 has been demonstrated to improve spatial  task scores, leading to what is known as the Mozart effect. Our previous work  revealed the positive effects of Mozart K.448 in reducing epileptiform  discharges in children with epilepsy. However, the mechanism remains unclear.  parasympathetic activation has been shown to help seizure control in many  studies. In this study, we investigated the effect of Mozart music on  epileptiform discharges and autonomic activity. METHODS: Sixty-four epileptic children with epileptiform discharges were  included. They all received electroencephalogram and electrocardiogram  examinations simultaneously before, during, and after listening to Mozart K.448  or K.545. The total number of epileptiform discharges during each session  (before, during, and after music) were divided by the duration (in minutes) of  the session and then compared. Heart rate variability including time and  frequency domain analysis was used to represent the autonomic function. RESULTS: The results showed that epileptiform discharges were significantly  reduced during and right after listening to Mozart music (33.3 ± 31.1%  reduction, p<0.001, during Mozart K.448 and 38.6 ± 43.3% reduction, p<0.001,  during Mozart K.545) (28.1 ± 43.2% reduction, p<0.001, after Mozart K.448 and  46.0 ± 40.5% reduction, p<0.001, after Mozart K.545). No significant difference  was noticed between the two pieces of music. The reduction was greatest in  patients with generalized seizures and discharges. Significant increases in  high-frequency (HF), the square root of the mean squared differences of  successive RR intervals (RMSSD), the standard deviation of differences between  adjacent RR intervals (SDSD), and a decrease in mean beats per minute (bpm) were  found during listening to Mozart music. Most of the patients with reduced  epileptiform discharges also showed a decreased LF/HF ratio, low-frequency  normalized units (LF nu), mean bpm, and an increased high-frequency normalized  units (HF nu). CONCLUSIONS: Listening to Mozart music decreased epileptiform discharges in  children with epilepsy. The majority of these patients showed an increase in  parasympathetic tone during music exposure. SIGNIFICANCE: Our results suggested that Mozart music stimuli induced  parasympathetic activation which may be involved in the effect of music in  reducing epileptiform discharges and the recurrence rate of seizures.', ""Mozart's Sonata for Two Pianos in D major, K.448 (Mozart K.448), has been shown  to improve mental function, leading to what is known as the Mozart Effect. Our  previous work revealed that epileptiform discharges in children with epilepsy  decrease during and right after listening to Mozart K.448. However, the duration  of the effect was not studied. In the study described here, we evaluated the  long-term effect of Mozart K.448 on epileptiform discharges in children with  epilepsy. Eighteen children with epilepsy whose seizures were clinically well  controlled with antiepileptic drugs were included. For each child, EEGs had  revealed persistent epileptiform discharges for at least 6 months. These  patients listened to Mozart K.448 for 8 minutes once a day before bedtime for 6  months. Epileptiform discharges were recorded and compared before and after 1,  2, and 6 months of listening to Mozart K.448. All of the children remained on  the same antiepileptic drug over the 6 months. Relationships between number of  epileptiform discharges and foci of discharges, intelligence, epilepsy etiology,  age, and gender were analyzed. Epileptiform discharges significantly decreased  by 53.2±47.4, 64.4±47.1, and 71.6±45.8%, respectively, after listening to Mozart  K.448 for 1, 2, and 6 months. All patients except those with occipital  discharges showed a significant decrease in epileptiform discharges. Patients  with normal intelligence and idiopathic epilepsy had greater decreases than  those with mental retardation and symptomatic epilepsy. Age and gender did not  affect the results. We conclude that long-term listening to Mozart K.448 may be  effective in decreasing epileptiform discharges in children with epilepsy in a  chronologically progressive manner."", 'Converging evidence suggests an association between spatial and music domains. A  cerebellar role in music-related information processing as well as in  spatial-temporal tasks has been documented. Here, we investigated the cerebellar  role in the association between spatial and musical domains, by testing  performances in embodied (EMR) or abstract (AMR) mental rotation tasks of  subjects listening Mozart Sonata K.448, which is reported to improve  spatial-temporal reasoning, in the presence or in the absence of continuous  theta burst stimulation (cTBS) of the left cerebellar hemisphere. In the absence  of cerebellar cTBS, music listening did not influence either MR task, thus not  revealing a ""Mozart Effect"". Cerebellar cTBS applied before musical listening  made subjects faster (P\u200a=\u200a0.005) and less accurate (P\u200a=\u200a0.005) in performing the  EMR but not the AMR task. Thus, cerebellar inhibition by TBS unmasked the effect  of musical listening on motor imagery. These data support a coupling between  music listening and sensory-motor integration in cerebellar networks for  embodied representations.', ""According to the first publication in 1993 by Rauscher et al. [Nature  1993;365:611], the Mozart effect implies the enhancement of reasoning skills  solving spatial problems in normal subjects after listening to Mozart's piano  sonata K 448. A further evaluation of this effect has raised the question  whether there is a link between music-generated emotions and a higher level of  cognitive abilities by mere listening. Positron emission tomography and  functional magnetic resonance imaging have revealed that listening to  pleasurable music activates cortical and subcortical cerebral areas where  emotions are processed. These neurobiological effects of music suggest that  auditory stimulation evokes emotions linked to heightened arousal and result in  temporarily enhanced performance in many cognitive domains. Music therapy  applies this arousal in a clinical setting as it may offer benefits to patients  by diverting their attention from unpleasant experiences and future  interventions. It has been applied in the context of various important clinical  conditions such as cardiovascular disorders, cancer pain, epilepsy, depression  and dementia. Furthermore, music may modulate the immune response, among other  things, evidenced by increasing the activity of natural killer cells,  lymphocytes and interferon-γ, which is an interesting feature as many diseases  are related to a misbalanced immune system. Many of these clinical studies,  however, suffer from methodological inadequacies. Nevertheless, at present,  there is moderate but not altogether convincing evidence that listening to known  and liked music helps to decrease the burden of a disease and enhances the  immune system by modifying stress."", 'The Mozart Effect is a phenomenon whereby certain pieces of music induce  temporary enhancement in ""spatial temporal reasoning."" To determine whether the  Mozart Effect can improve surgical performance, 55 male volunteers (mean age =  20.6 years, range = 16-27), novice to surgery, were timed as they completed an  activity course on a laparoscopic simulator. Subjects were then randomized for  exposure to 1 of 2 musical pieces by Mozart (n = 21) and Dream Theater (n = 19),  after which they repeated the course. Following a 15-minute exposure to a  nonmusical piece, subjects were exposed to one of the pieces and performed the  activity course a third time. An additional group (n = 15) that was not  corandomized performed the tasks without any exposure to music. The percent  improvements in completion time between 3 successive trials were calculated for  each subject and group means compared. In 2 of the tasks, subjects exposed to  the Dream Theater piece achieved approximately 30% more improvement (26.7 ±  8.3%) than those exposed to the Mozart piece (20.2 ± 7.8%, P = .021) or to no  music (20.4 ± 9.1%, P = .049). Distinct patterns of covariance between baseline  performance and subsequent improvement were observed for the different musical  conditions and tasks.

DESIGN: Prospective study. METHODS: Four consecutive infants between 7 and 19 months of age with unilateral  periocular vascular lesions that intermittently obstructed vision in the  affected eye and no clinical evidence of amblyopia were evaluated. No child had  anisometropia greater than 0.50 diopter in the greatest meridian or strabismus.  Sweep visual evoked potential vernier acuity was measured under monocular  viewing conditions with the fellow eye tested as the control. RESULTS: Response amplitudes and acuity thresholds were significantly diminished  in the affected eyes. A phase analysis showed slowing of the response in the  affected eyes compared with the control eyes. CONCLUSIONS: An amblyopia-like effect on vernier acuity occurred in infants with  unilateral periocular vascular birthmarks when the lesion caused intermittent  occlusion of the eye. Whether long-term effects will occur is unknown, but  children with no clinically apparent amblyopia in the setting of a vascular mark  or other cause of intermittent occlusion of the visual axis should be followed,  since these electrophysiology findings suggest amblyopia may be present.', ""HYPOTHESIS: The goal of this study was to assess the impact of dizziness  handicap, illness intrusiveness (in relation to vertigo, tinnitus, and hearing  problems), and illness uncertainty on depression in people with the symptoms of  Ménière's disease. BACKGROUND: Ménière's disease is a progressive disease of the inner ear, the  symptoms of which are vertigo, tinnitus, hearing loss, and aural fullness.  Although pharmacologic treatments may reduce acute vertigo spells and dizziness,  they rarely disappear entirely. Previous research shows that Ménière's disease  is unpredictable and has a negative impact on patients' quality of life. METHODS: Questionnaires measuring Dizziness Handicap, Illness Intrusiveness,  Illness Uncertainty, and Depression were completed by 74 people with  self-reported symptoms of Ménière's disease. Bivariate correlations,  repeated-measures analysis of variance, and multiple regression analyses were  used to assess the contribution of dizziness handicap, illness intrusiveness,  and illness uncertainty to depression. CONCLUSION: Vertigo was more intrusive than tinnitus, hearing problems, and most  other comparator illnesses. The intrusiveness of the symptoms of Ménière's  disease accounted for 32% of the variance in depression scores, which were high;  illness uncertainty did not account for additional variance. Dizziness handicap  accounted for 31% of the variation in depression. Although the symptoms of  Ménière's disease may not be alleviated by psychological methods, programs that  target cognitions in relation to the embarrassment in front of others, and the  feeling of being handicapped, may lessen the psychosocial impact of the symptoms  of Ménière's disease, which may reduce some of the depression felt in this  group."", 'The condition in which individuals with normal pure tone audiograms complain of  hearing difficulties, especially in the presence of background noise, (normal  pure tone audiograms), has had a number of different names.

AIM: To determine whether hyperbilirubinemia suppresses the brainstem auditory  electrophysiology in term neonates. METHODS: Maximum length sequence brainstem auditory evoked response (MLS BAER)  was recorded shortly after confirming hyperbilirubinemia in 58 term neonates.  Wave amplitudes of the response were analyzed in detail. RESULTS: Compared with age-matched term controls, the neonates with  hyperbilirubinemia showed a significant reduction in the amplitudes of MLS BAER  waves III and particularly V at all click rates 91-910/s. The reduction tended  to be more significant at higher than lower rates. Wave I amplitude was reduced  at 910/s. V/I amplitude ratio was decreased at all click rates. Therefore, the  amplitudes of MLS BAER, particularly later, waves were all reduced. The  amplitudes of all MLS BAER waves tended to be reduced with the increase in total  serum bilirubin level. All wave amplitudes were correlated with the level of  total serum bilirubin at some or most click rates. CONCLUSIONS: Brainstem auditory electrophysiology is suppressed in neonates with  hyperbilirubinemia, which related to the severity of hyperbilirubinemia. Wave  amplitudes are valuable BAER variables to detect functional impairment of the  brainstem and auditory pathway in neonatal hyperbilirubinemia, and are  recommended to be used in assessing bilirubin neurotoxicity to the neonatal  brain.', ""OBJECTIVE: To explore whether acute acoustic trauma or noise-induced hearing  loss may cause the later development of Ménière's Disease.

156,Are most driver gene mutations synonymous or non-synonymous?,"['BACKGROUND: Olfactory neuroblastoma (ONB) is a rare cancer of the sinonasal  tract with little molecular characterization. We performed whole genome  sequencing (WGS) on paired normal and tumor DNA from a patient with  metastatic-ONB to identify the somatic alterations that might be drivers of  tumorigenesis and/or metastatic progression. METHODOLOGY/PRINCIPAL FINDINGS: Genomic DNA was isolated from fresh frozen  tissue from a metastatic lesion and whole blood, followed by WGS at >30X depth,  alignment and mapping, and mutation analyses. Sanger sequencing was used to  confirm selected mutations. Sixty-two somatic short nucleotide variants (SNVs)  and five deletions were identified inside coding regions, each causing a  non-synonymous DNA sequence change. We selected seven SNVs and validated them by  Sanger sequencing. In the metastatic ONB samples collected several months prior  to WGS, all seven mutations were present. However, in the original surgical  resection specimen (prior to evidence of metastatic disease), mutations in KDR,  MYC, SIN3B, and NLRC4 genes were not present, suggesting that these were  acquired with disease progression and/or as a result of post-treatment effects. CONCLUSIONS/SIGNIFICANCE: This work provides insight into the evolution of ONB  cancer cells and provides a window into the more complex factors, including  tumor clonality and multiple driver mutations.', 'Cancer cells evolve from normal cells by somatic mutations and natural  selection. Comparing the evolution of cancer cells and that of organisms can  elucidate the genetic basis of cancer. Here we analyse somatic mutations in >400  cancer genomes. We find that the frequency of somatic single-nucleotide  variations increases with replication time during the S phase much more  drastically than germ-line single-nucleotide variations and somatic large-scale  structural alterations, including amplifications and deletions. The ratio of  nonsynonymous to synonymous single-nucleotide variations is higher for cancer  cells than for germ-line cells, suggesting weaker purifying selection against  somatic mutations. Among genes with recurrent mutations only cancer driver genes  show evidence of strong positive selection, and late-replicating regions are  depleted of cancer driver genes, although enriched for recurrently mutated  genes. These observations show that replication timing has a prominent role in  shaping the single-nucleotide variation landscape of cancer cells.', 'Genetic variation for pathogen infectivity is an important driver of disease  incidence and prevalence in both natural and managed systems. Here, we use the  interaction between the rust pathogen, Melampsora lini, and two host plants,  Linum marginale and Linum usitatissimum, to examine how host-pathogen  interactions influence the maintenance of polymorphism in genes underlying  pathogen virulence. Extensive sequence variation at two effector loci (AvrP123,  AvrP4) was found in M. lini isolates collected from across the native range of  L. marginale in Australia, as well as in isolates collected from a second host,  the cultivated species L. usitatissimum. A highly significant excess of  nonsynonymous compared with synonymous polymorphism was found at both loci,  suggesting that diversifying selection is important for the maintenance of the  observed sequence diversity. Agrobacterium-mediated transient transformation  assays were used to demonstrate that variants of both the AvrP123 and AvrP4  genes are differentially recognized by resistance genes in L. marginale. We  further characterized patterns of nucleotide variation at AvrP123 and AvrP4 in  10 local populations of M. lini infecting the wild host L. marginale.  Populations were significantly differentiated with respect to allelic  representation at the Avr loci, suggesting the possibility of local selection  maintaining distinct genetic structures between pathogen populations, whereas  limited diversity may be explained via selective sweeps and demographic  bottlenecks. Together, these results imply that interacting selective and  nonselective factors, acting across a broad range of scales, are important for  the generation and maintenance of adaptively significant variation in  populations of M. lini.', ""This is the first report of an insect esterase efficiently expressed in the  methylotrophic yeast Pichia pastoris (so far insect esterases have been produced  only in the baculovirus system). Having isolated a Tribolium castaneum  carboxylesterase cDNA (TCE), we were initially unable to express it in  Escherichia coli or P. pastoris despite significant transcription levels. As  codon usage bias is different in T. castaneum and P. pastoris, we assumed this  was a possible explanation for the translational barrier observed in yeast.  Accordingly, we designed and constructed by recursive PCR a synthetic TCE gene  (synTCE) optimized for heterologous expression in P. pastoris, i.e., a gene in  which certain TCE codons are replaced with synonymous codons 'preferred' in P.  pastoris. When the altered gene was placed under the control of either the P.  pastoris glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase (GAP) promoter or the  inducible alcohol oxidase (AOX1) promoter and introduced on an expression vector  into P. pastoris, its product was produced intracellularly. We also successfully  explored the possibility of obtaining a secreted product: P. pastoris cells  expressing an in-frame fusion of synTCE with the alpha-factor secretion signal  under the control of the GAP promoter were found to secrete the recombinant  esterase into the external medium (to a concentration of 7 mg/L). In addition to  this demonstration of TCE production in yeast, our results suggest that the GAP  promoter could advantageously replace the AOX1 promoter as a driver of synTCE  expression. TCE specific activity was approximately 5 U/mg when p-nitrophenyl  acetate was used as substrate."", ""A common goal of tumor sequencing projects is finding genes whose mutations are  selected for during tumor development. This is accomplished by choosing genes  that have more non-synonymous mutations than expected from an estimated  background mutation frequency. While this background frequency is unknown, it  can be estimated using both the observed synonymous mutation frequency and the  non-synonymous to synonymous mutation ratio. The synonymous mutation frequency  can be determined across all genes or in a gene-specific manner. This choice  introduces an interesting trade-off. A gene-specific frequency adjusts for an  underlying mutation bias, but is difficult to estimate given missing synonymous  mutation counts. Using a genome-wide synonymous frequency is more robust, but is  less suited for adjusting biases. Studying four evaluation criteria for  identifying genes with high non-synonymous mutation burden (reflecting  preferential selection of expressed genes, genes with mutations in conserved  bases, genes with many protein interactions, and genes that show loss of  heterozygosity), we find that the gene-specific synonymous frequency is superior  in the gene expression and protein interaction tests. In conclusion, the use of  the gene-specific synonymous mutation frequency is well suited for assessing a  gene's non-synonymous mutation burden."", 'Herein we report a proof-of-principle study illustrating a novel dog-human  comparison strategy that addresses a central aim of cancer research, namely  cancer driver-passenger distinction. We previously demonstrated that sporadic  canine colorectal cancers (CRCs) share similar molecular pathogenesis mechanisms  as their human counterparts. In this study, we compared the genome-wide copy  number abnormalities between 29 human and 10 canine sporadic CRCs. This led to  the identification of 73 driver candidate genes (DCGs), altered in both species,  and with 27 from the whole genome and 46 from dog-human genomic rearrangement  breakpoint (GRB) regions, as well as 38 passenger candidate genes (PCGs),  altered in humans only and located in GRB regions. We noted that DCGs  significantly differ from PCGs in every analysis conducted to assess their  cancer relevance and biological functions. Importantly, although PCGs are not  enriched in any specific functions, DCGs possess significantly enhanced  functionality closely associated with cell proliferation and death regulation,  as well as with epithelial cell apicobasal polarity establishment/maintenance.  These observations support the notion that, in sporadic CRCs of both species,  cell polarity genes not only contribute in preventing cancer cell invasion and  spreading, but also likely serve as tumor suppressors by modulating cell growth.  This pilot study validates our novel strategy and has uncovered four new  potential cell polarity and colorectal tumor suppressor genes (RASA3, NUPL1,  DENND5A and AVL9). Expansion of this study would make more driver-passenger  distinctions for cancers with large genomic amplifications or deletions, and  address key questions regarding the relationship between cancer pathogenesis and  epithelial cell polarity control in mammals.', ""MOTIVATION: Cancers arise as the result of somatically acquired changes in the  DNA of cancer cells. However, in addition to the mutations that confer a growth  advantage, cancer genomes accumulate a large number of somatic mutations  resulting from normal DNA damage and repair processes as well as carcinogenic  exposures or cancer related aberrations of DNA maintenance machinery. These  mutagenic processes often produce characteristic mutational patterns called  mutational signatures. The decomposition of a cancer genome's mutation catalog  into mutations consistent with such signatures can provide valuable information  about cancer etiology. However, the results from different decomposition methods  are not always consistent. Hence, one needs to be able to not only decompose a  patient's mutational profile into signatures but also establish the accuracy of  such decomposition. RESULTS: We proposed two complementary ways of measuring confidence and  stability of decomposition results and applied them to analyze mutational  signatures in breast cancer genomes. We identified both very stable and highly  unstable signatures, as well as signatures that previously have not been  associated with breast cancer. We also provided additional support for the novel  signatures. Our results emphasize the importance of assessing the confidence and  stability of inferred signature contributions. AVAILABILITY AND IMPLEMENTATION: All tools developed in this paper have been  implemented in an R package, called SignatureEstimation, which is available from  https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/CBBresearch/Przytycka/index.cgi\\#signatureestimation. SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: Supplementary data are available at Bioinformatics  online."", 'Single-nucleotide substitutions are a defining characteristic of cancer genomes.  Many single-nucleotide substitutions in cancer genomes arise because of errors  in DNA replication, which is spatio-temporally stratified. Here we propose that  DNA replication patterns help shape the mutational landscapes of normal and  cancer genomes. Using data on five fully sequenced cancer types and two personal  genomes, we determined that the frequency of intergenic single-nucleotide  substitution is significantly higher in late DNA replication timing regions,  even after controlling for a number of genomic features. Furthermore, some  substitution signatures are more frequent in certain DNA replication timing  zones. Finally, integrating data on higher-order nuclear organization, we found  that genomic regions in close spatial proximity to late-replicating domains  display similar mutation spectra as the late-replicating regions themselves.  These data suggest that DNA replication timing together with higher-order  genomic organization contribute to the patterns of single-nucleotide  substitution in normal and cancer genomes.', 'The human genome is divided into isochores, large stretches (>>300 kb) of  genomic DNA with more or less consistent GC content. Mutational/neutralist and  selectionist models have been put forward to explain their existence. A major  criticism of the mutational models is that they cannot account for the higher GC  content at fourfold-redundant silent sites within exons (GC4) than in flanking  introns (GCi). Indeed, it has been asserted that it is hard to envisage a  mutational bias explanation, as it is difficult to see how repair enzymes might  act differently in exons and their flanking introns. However, this rejection, we  note, ignores the effects of transposable elements (TEs), which are a major  component of introns and tend to cause them to have a GC content different from  (usually lower than) that dictated by point mutational processes alone. As TEs  tend not to insert at the extremities of introns, this model predicts that GC  content at the extremities of introns should be more like that at GC4 than are  the intronic interiors. This we show to be true. The model also correctly  predicts that small introns should have a composition more like that at GC4 than  large introns. We conclude that the logic of the previous rejection of  neutralist models is unsafe.', 'In the absence of bias between the two DNA strands for mutation and selection,  the base composition within each strand should be such that A = T and C = G  (this state is called Parity Rule type 2, PR2). At a genome scale, i.e. when  considering the base composition of a whole genome, PR2 is a good approximation,  but there are local and systematic deviations. The question is whether these  deviations are a consequence of an underlying bias in mutation or selection. We  have tried to review published hypotheses to classify them within the mutational  or selective group. This dichotomy is, however, too crude because there is at  least one hypothesis based simultaneously upon mutation and selection.']",A common goal of tumor sequencing projects is finding genes whose mutations are selected for during tumor development. This is accomplished by choosing genes that have more non-synonymous mutations than expected from an estimated background mutation frequency.  
157,What is resistin?,"['Resistin is an adipokine that induces insulin resistance in mice; serum  concentrations are decreased by fasting and increased by feeding. Adiponectin,  another adipokine, improves insulin sensitivity. The aims of this study were to  determine the effects of glucose and meal loading on serum resistin and total  and high-molecular weight (HMW) adiponectin in humans and to explore potential  determinants of fasting serum resistin and of changes in resistin. Serum  resistin and total and HMW adiponectin were measured by enzyme-linked  immunosorbent assay in young, lean, nondiabetic subjects during 75-g oral  glucose tolerance test (OGTT) and meal tolerance test (MTT). Resistin single  nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) -420 was typed. Serum resistin was decreased at 60  and 120 minutes during OGTT compared with baseline (n = 36, 1-way  repeated-measures analysis of variance, P < .0001; Scheffe, P = .0457 and P <  .0001, respectively). Serum resistin was also reduced at 240 minutes during MTT  (n = 33, 1-way repeated measures analysis of variance, P < .0001; Scheffe, P =  .0002). Multiple regression analysis adjusted for age, sex, and body mass index  revealed that the reductions in serum resistin were dependent on baseline  resistin levels. Subjects with greater baseline concentrations of resistin  experienced more pronounced declines in resistin (OGTT, unstandardized  regression coefficient (beta) = -0.19, P = .0005; MTT, beta = -0.63, P < .0001).  Serum total and HMW adiponectin was unchanged. Fasting serum resistin was  positively correlated with the G allele number of SNP -420 (beta = 7.70, P =  .01) and white blood cell count (beta = 0.007, P = .0001) adjusted for age, sex,  and body mass index. Therefore, in young, lean, nondiabetic humans, serum  resistin was reduced by glucose and meal loading; the reduction in resistin was  greater in subjects with higher fasting resistin. Fasting resistin was  correlated with SNP -420 and white blood cell count.', 'Author information: (1)Department of Chemical Drugs, Faculty of Pharmacy, University of Veterinary  and Pharmaceutical Sciences, Brno, Czech Republic.

A ligand for Toll-like receptor 4, resistin modulates  the recruitment and activation of myeloid cells, notably neutrophils.  Neutrophils are major drivers of cystic fibrosis (CF) lung disease, in part due  to the release of human neutrophil elastase- and myeloperoxidase-rich primary  granules, leading to tissue damage. Here we assessed the relationship of  resistin to CF lung disease. METHODS: Resistin levels were measured in plasma and sputum from three  retrospective CF cohorts spanning a wide range of disease. We also assessed the  ability of neutrophils to secrete resistin upon activation in vitro. Finally, we  constructed a multivariate model assessing the relationship between resistin  levels and lung function. RESULTS: Plasma resistin levels were only marginally higher in CF than in  healthy control subjects. By contrast, sputum resistin levels were very high in  CF, reaching 50-100 fold higher levels than in plasma. Among CF patients, higher  plasma resistin levels were associated with allergic bronchopulmonary  aspergillosis, and higher sputum resistin levels were associated with CF-related  diabetes. Mechanistically, in vitro release of neutrophil primary granules was  concomitant with resistin secretion. Overall, sputum resistin levels were  negatively correlated with CF lung function, independently of other variables  (age, sex, and genotype). CONCLUSIONS: Our data establish relationships between resistin levels in the  plasma and sputum of CF patients that correlate with disease status, and  identify resistin as a novel mechanistic link between neutrophilic inflammation  and lung disease in CF.', 'Resistin is a secreted adipose tissue hormone that belongs to the resistin-like  molecule family. We report here a new alternatively spliced isoform of the rat  resistin gene, named S-resistin (short resistin), detected in adipose tissue by  reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR). A comparison of this  cDNA variant and genomic sequences indicates the lack of the second exon  containing the secretory consensus signal. Both cDNAs, resistin and S-resistin,  were carboxy-tagged with FLAG epitope and transiently expressed in cultured cell  lines. While the resistin-FLAG construct gives the expected pattern for a  secretion protein, the S-resistin-FLAG construct yielded a predominant nuclear  staining. These results indicate that this splicing event regulates the fate and  probably the function of the mature protein.', 'OBJECTIVES: Resistin is an adipocytokine that has been related to inflammation  and insulin resistance. Following knee injury, elevated levels of resistin have  been found in synovial fluid (SF) while very little is known about the role of  resistin in osteoarthritis (OA). The aim of the present study was to investigate  resistin levels in OA joints and to determine if it is associated with  inflammatory and catabolic factors in the joints. METHOD: SF, plasma, and cartilage samples were collected from 88 OA patients  undergoing knee replacement surgery. Resistin levels were measured by  enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) in SF, plasma, and cartilage culture  media. RESULTS: Significant levels of resistin [0.75 (0.67) ng/mL; median (IQR)] were  found in SF from OA patients. Resistin correlated positively with interleukin  (IL)-6 (r = 0.39, p < 0.001) and with matrix metalloproteinases MMP-1 (r = 0.31,  p = 0.004) and MMP-3 (r = 0.24, p = 0.024) in SF. Resistin was also released  from cultured OA cartilage and it correlated with resistin levels in SF (r =  0.39, p < 0.001). In addition, resistin levels in plasma correlated positively  with those in SF (r = 0.44, p < 0.001). There were no differences in SF or  plasma resistin concentrations between females and males or between non-diabetic  and diabetic patients, and resistin did not correlate with body mass index  (BMI). CONCLUSIONS: Resistin is present in OA joints and is released from OA cartilage.  Levels of resistin in SF are associated with inflammatory and catabolic factors,  suggesting that resistin has a role to play in the pathogenesis of, and as a  possible drug target in, OA.', 'African Americans (AAs) have higher mortality rate from breast cancer than that  of Caucasian Americans (CAs) even when socioeconomic factors are accounted for.  To better understand the driving biological factors of this health disparity, we  performed a comprehensive differential gene expression analysis, including  subtype- and stage-specific analysis, using the breast cancer data in the Cancer  Genome Atlas (TCGA). In total, 674 unique genes and other transcripts were found  differentially expressed between these two populations. The numbers of  differentially expressed genes between AA and CA patients increased in each  stage of tumor progression: there were 26 in stage I, 161 in stage II, and 223  in stage III. Resistin, a gene that is linked to obesity, insulin resistance,  and breast cancer, was expressed more than four times higher in AA tumors. An  uncharacterized, long, non-coding RNA, LOC90784, was down-regulated in AA  tumors, and its expression was inversely related to cancer stage and was the  lowest in triple negative AA breast tumors. Network analysis showed increased  expression of a majority of components in p53 and BRCA1 subnetworks in AA breast  tumor samples, and members of the aurora B and polo-like kinase signaling  pathways were also highly expressed. Higher gene expression diversity was  observed in more advanced stage breast tumors suggesting increased genomic  instability during tumor progression. Amplified resistin expression may indicate  insulin-resistant type II diabetes and obesity are associated with AA breast  cancer. Expression of LOC90784 may have a protective effect on breast cancer  patients, and its loss, particularly in triple negative breast cancer, could be  having detrimental effects. This work helps elucidate molecular mechanisms of  breast cancer health disparity and identifies putative biomarkers and  therapeutic targets such as resistin, and the aurora B and polo-like kinase  signaling pathways for treating AA breast cancer patients.', 'Adipokines (leptin, adiponectin, and hepatocyte growth factor (HGF)) secreted  from adipose tissue have come to be recognized for their contribution to the  mechanisms by which obesity and related metabolic disorders influence breast  cancer risk. In this review, we discuss the direct and indirect effects of these  protein factors on the biological and clinical aspects of breast cancer biology,  and emphasize their distinctive modes of action through endocrine-, paracrine-,  and autocrine-mediated pathways. The stimulatory effects of leptin on breast  cancer growth were considered to occur primarily via activation of the estrogen  receptor; however, new evidence suggests that leptin may be acting on downstream  cell signaling pathways in both estrogen-dependent and -independent cell types.  Another secretory adipokine, HGF, may act largely not only to promote tumor cell  invasion, but also to enhance tumor growth indirectly by stimulating  angiogenesis. In contrast, adiponectin, an endogenous insulin sensitizer, exerts  a direct growth-inhibitory effect on tumor cells by downregulating cell  proliferation and upregulating apoptosis, and also inhibits tumor-related  angiogenesis.', 'This study evaluated serum levels of novel adipokines in acute ischemic stroke  (AIS) and their association with prognosis. We enrolled 168 patients with AIS  and 58 stroke-free age- and sex-matched individuals (controls). Clinical  parameters, carotid ultrasound, metabolic profile, vaspin, apelin, visfatin, and  ghrelin were assayed. Stroke-patients were sampled at hospital admission and  were prospectively followed-up (median 16 months) for the cardiovascular  endpoint (cardiovascular death/stroke/myocardial infarction). At admission,  stroke-patients appeared with higher levels of systolic blood pressure, hsCRP  and worse metabolic profile (p<0.05), (p>0.05). Compared to controls, AIS group  had significantly higher serum concentrations of visfatin (22.92±9.72ng/ml vs  16.56±7.82ng/ml, p=0.006) and lower of vaspin (0.94±0.43ng/ml vs 1.84±0.82ng/ml,  p=0.019) and ghrelin (3.47±1.44ng/ml vs 5.93±2.78ng/ml, p<0.001), while apelin  did not differ between groups. Similar differences in adipokines were found  between stroke subgroups with and without significant ipsilateral carotid  stenosis (>50%) (p<0.05). In stepwise logistic regression analysis adjusted for  diabetes, hypertension, dyslipidemia and age, visfatin (p=0.026) and ghrelin  (p=0.012) proved to be independent predictors of AIS. During follow-up, 27  patients achieved cardiovascular endpoint. In addition to coronary artery  disease and NIHSS score, visfatin serum levels was associated with  cardiovascular endpoint (HR: 1.255, 95% CI: 1.025-1.576). Our results suggested  the association of AIS with higher visfatin and lower vaspin and ghrelin serum  levels. Visfatin levels can be a predictor of cardiovascular mortality and  morbidity in AIS.', 'CONTEXT: Data on the presence/quantification of the neurotrophic adipokines  retinol-binding protein-4 (RBP4), clusterin, and pigment epithelium-derived  factor (PEDF) in human cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) are scarce and migration of  these adipokines across of the blood-brain barrier (BBB) is uncertain. OBJECTIVE: This work aimed to quantify RBP4, PEDF, and clusterin in paired serum  and CSF samples of patients undergoing neurological evaluation. METHODS: A total of 268 patients (109 male, 159 female) were included. Adipokine  serum and CSF concentrations were measured by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay  in duplicate. RESULTS: RBP4 was abundant in serum (mean, 31.9\u2005±\u200524.2 μg/mL). The serum  concentrations were approximately 145 times higher than in CSF (CSF to serum  RBP4 ratio, 8.2\u2005±\u20054.3\u2005×\u200510-3). PEDF was detectable in serum (mean, 30.2\u2005±\u200511.7  μg/mL) and concentrations were approximately 25 times higher than in CSF (CSF to  serum PEDF ratio, 42.3\u2005±\u200515.6\u2005×\u200510-3). Clusterin serum concentrations were  abundant with mean levels of 346.0\u2005±\u2005114.6 μg/mL, which were approximately 40  times higher than CSF levels (CSF to serum clusterin ratio, 29.6\u2005±\u200523.4\u2005×\u200510-3).  RBP4 and PEDF serum levels correlated positively with CSF levels, which were  increased in overweight/obese patients and in type 2 diabetic patients. The CSF  concentrations of all 3 adipokines increased with BBB dysfunction. RBP4 in CSF  correlated positively with inflammatory parameters. In detail, only RBP4 showed  the kinetics and associations that are mandatory for a putative mediator of the  fat-brain axis. CONCLUSION: RBP4, PEDF, and clusterin are permeable to the BBB and increase with  the measure of BBB dysfunction. RBP4 represents an inflammatory neurotrophic  adipokine and is a promising mediator of the fat-brain axis.', 'A wide range of adipokines identified over the past years has allowed  considering the white adipose tissue as a secretory organ closely integrated  into overall physiological and metabolic control. Apelin, a ubiquitously  expressed peptide was known to exert different physiological effects mainly on  the cardiovascular system and the regulation of fluid homeostasis prior to its  characterization as an adipokine. This has broadened its range of action and  apelin now appears clearly as a new player in energy metabolism in addition to  leptin and adiponectin. Apelin has been shown to act on glucose and lipid  metabolism but also to modulate insulin secretion. Moreover, different studies  in both animals and humans have shown that plasma apelin concentrations are  usually increased during obesity and type 2 diabetes. This mini-review will  focus on the various systemic apelin effects on energy metabolism by addressing  its mechanisms of action. The advances concerning the role of apelin in  metabolic diseases in relation with the recent reports on apelin concentrations  in obese and/or diabetic subjects will also be discussed.']","The adipocyte-secreting adipokine, resistin, may play a critical role in the modulation of inflammatory diseases."
158,Does prolactinoma increase osteoporosis risk?,"['Prolactin-secreting adenomas represent nearly 40% to 60% of all pituitary  adenomas. Prolactin inhibits the secretion of gonadotropin-releasing hormone  that is responsible for the synthesis and secretion of gonadotropins. Sex  steroids have an important effect on the regulation of bone metabolism in men.  Decreased libido and impotence are the most common presenting symptoms of  hyperprolactinemia in males. These symptoms are easily neglected by both  patients and some physicians. We present a 22-year-old man with multiple  osteoporotic fractures associated with prolactinoma despite the use of  teriparatide for 18 months. We emphasize and highlight the importance of  hyperprolactinemia and fractures caused by high prolactin levels.', 'The authors present an update on the various treatment modalities and discuss  management strategies for prolactinomas. Prolactinomas are the most common type  of functional pituitary tumor. Effective hyperprolactinemia treatment is of  great importance, due to its potential deleterious effects including  infertility, gonadal dysfunction and osteoporosis. Dopamine agonist therapy is  the first line of treatment for prolactinomas because of its effectiveness in  normalizing serum prolactin levels and shrinking tumor size. Though withdrawal  of dopamine agonist treatment is safe and may be implemented following certain  recommendations, recurrence of disease after cessation of the drug occurs in a  substantial proportion of patients. Concerns regarding the safety of dopamine  agonists have been raised, but its safety profile remains high, allowing its use  during pregnancy. Surgery is typically indicated for patients who are resistant  to medical therapy or intolerant of its adverse side effects, or are  experiencing progressive tumor growth. Surgical resection can also be considered  as a primary treatment for those with smaller focal tumors where a biochemical  cure can be expected as an alternative to lifelong dopamine agonist treatment.  Stereotactic radiosurgery also serves as an option for those refractory to  medical and surgical therapy.', 'The aim of the study was to evaluate the osteoporotic fracture risk in  premenopausal women with hyperprolactinemia due to prolactinoma. Bone mineral  density (BMD) was measured in 20 white, premenopausal women with prolactinoma  and in 60 healthy control white women, using quantitative ultrasound (QUS) at  the os calcis, with an Achilles Lunar Plus device. We measured all three  parameters of QUS: broadband ultrasound attenuation (BUA), speed of sound (SOS)  and stiffness. BMD results were expressed also as T- and Z-scores. Age and body  mass index (BMI) were not statistically significantly different between the two  groups. Comparative analysis showed reduced values of QUS parameters in women  with prolactinoma versus controls. Only the difference in SOS parameter was  statistically significant between the two studied groups (p = 0.0001). The  Z-score was significant lower in women with prolactinoma than in healthy women.  These data reveal a significant bone loss in women with prolactinoma compared to  controls. The SOS parameter showed a good negative correlation with age, and all  the QUS parameters were positively correlated with BMI. The relative risk for  developing osteoporosis in women with prolactinoma was found to be 4.5,  indicating that hyperprolactinemia in women is a major risk factor for  osteoporosis.', 'INTRODUCTION: Osteopenia and osteoporosis because of hyperprolactinaemia caused  by prolactinoma may be followed by an increased risk of fracture. There are no  data on the bone effects of functional hyperprolactinaemia. The aim was to  assess the influence of hyperprolactinaemia of various origins on bone turnover  and density in different skeletal sites. MATERIAL AND METHODS: The study was carried out in 75 women (aged 30.53 +/-  7.8): Group I--32 women with prolactinoma and Group II--43 women with functional  hyperprolactinaemia. Both groups of patients were subdivided into those with  hypogonadism and those with normal gonadal function. The control group consisted  of 29 healthy women aged (33.59 +/- 4.7). In all subjects PRL and bone turnover  markers (BAP, OC, ICTP) were studied. BMD measurements (lumbar spine, forearm,  proximal femur and total body) were carried out using DXA. RESULTS: Higher PRL concentrations were observed in patients than in controls.  The values of bone turnover markers (BAP, ICTP) were shown to be higher in  patient groups and subgroups than in controls. In patients with prolactinoma  lumbar spine BMD was lower than in patients with functional hyperprolactinaemia  and controls. Total body BMD was also lower, albeit to a lesser extent. CONCLUSIONS: Hyperprolactinaemia caused by prolactinoma in women influences bone  metabolism unfavourably, more by the impact on the activity of bone turnover  markers than on BMD. This provides an opportunity for earlier assessment of bone  metabolism disturbances before the BMD changes can be observed. Functional  hyperprolactinaemia does not determine such a harmful effect on bone metabolism  as hyperprolactinemia due to prolactinoma.', 'Humans with prolactinoma are at risk for osteoporosis. The relative  contributions of hyperprolactinemia-induced hypogonadism and the prolactin (PRL)  excess per se have been unclear from clinical studies. To determine the effects  of PRL excess, two models of chronic hyperprolactinemia were used. In one, mild  hyperprolactinemia was produced in rats bearing extra anterior pituitary glands  under the kidney capsule. Severe hyperprolactinemia was produced by  subcutaneously transplanting the PRL-secreting MMQ tumor into other rats. To  control for estrogen deficiency, the rats were ovariectomized. In some  experiments, estrogen replacement was provided. Urinary calcium excretion was  increased in hyperprolactinemic rats compared with controls, regardless of  severity of PRL excess and estrogen status. This suggested that PRL excess  itself had some effect on calcium balance. More importantly, however, the spinal  bone mineral density (BMD; measured by dual-energy x-ray densitometry) of mildly  hyperprolactinemic ovariectomized rats was the same as control ovariectomized  rats. Similarly, tibial dry weight and ash weight were affected by the estrogen  status, but not by the severe PRL excess of the tumor-implanted rats. Thus,  despite the evidence for an increase in urinary calcium excretion in  hyperprolactinemic rats, estrogen deficiency is much more important in  determining bone mineral. Therefore, the present data indicate that the  osteoporosis of hyperprolactinemia is likely due to PRL-induced hypogonadism,  rather than a direct effect of PRL on calcium homeostatis.', ""Female sex hormones are thought to affect women's risk of developing central  nervous system (CNS) tumors. Some have reported an increased risk in users of  menopausal hormone therapy (HT) but evidence is limited. In the UK General  Practice Research Database we compared prospectively collected information on HT  prescriptions in women aged 50-79 years with CNS tumors diagnosed in 1987-2011  with that in matched controls (four per case). Relative risks (RRs) in relation  to prescribed HT were calculated overall and by CNS tumor subtype. Statistical  tests are two-sided. For all CNS tumors (n = 3,500), glioma (n = 689),  meningioma (n = 1,197), acoustic neuroma (n = 439), and pituitary tumors (n =  273) adjusted RRs for women prescribed HT versus not were, respectively, 1.21  (95% confidence intervals (CI)\u2009= 1.10-1.32, p < 0.0001), 1.14 (0.93-1.40, p =  0.2), 1.30 (1.11-1.51, p = 0.001), 1.37 (1.06-1.75, p = 0.01), and 1.35  (0.99-1.85, p = 0.06). There was no significant difference in risk by tumor  subtype (p(heterogeneity) = 0.6). A meta-analysis was conducted, combining our  results with those from other published studies with prospectively collected  exposure information. The meta-analyses yielded significantly increased risks  for all CNS tumors, glioma and meningioma in users of estrogen-only [1.35  (1.22-1.49), 1.23 (1.06-1.42) and 1.31 (1.20-1.43), respectively] but not  estrogen-progestin HT [1.09 (0.99-1.19), 0.92 (0.78-1.08) and 1.05 (0.95-1.16),  respectively]; these differences were statistically significant (p < 0.005 for  each tumor type). There was no significant difference between glioma and  meningioma risk in users of estrogen-only HT. The totality of the available  evidence suggests an increased risk of all CNS tumors (and of glioma and  meningioma separately) in users of estrogen-only HT. Absolute excess risk (2 per  10,000 users over 5 years) is small."", ""OBJECT: The 2-fold higher incidence of meningioma in women compared with men has  long suggested a role for hormonally mediated risk factors, but specific  mechanisms remain elusive. METHODS: The study included data obtained in 1127 women 29-79 years of age with  intracranial meningioma diagnosed among residents of Connecticut, Massachusetts,  North Carolina, the San Francisco Bay Area, and 8 Texas counties between May 1,  2006, and October 6, 2011, and data obtained in 1092 control individuals who  were frequency matched for age group and geography with meningioma patients. RESULTS: No association was observed for age at menarche, age at menopause, or  parity and meningioma risk. Women who reported breastfeeding for at least 6  months were at reduced risk of meningioma (OR 0.78, 95% CI 0.63-0.96). A  significant positive association existed between meningioma risk and increased  body mass index (p < 0.01) while a significant negative association existed  between meningioma risk and current smoking (p < 0.01). Among premenopausal  women, current use of oral contraceptives was associated with an increased risk  of meningiomas (OR 1.8, 95% CI 1.1-2.9), while current use of hormone  replacement therapy among postmenopausal women was not associated with a  significant elevation in risk (OR 1.1, 95% CI 0.74-1.67). There was no  association between use of fertility medications and meningioma risk. CONCLUSIONS: The authors' study confirms associations for body mass index,  breastfeeding, and cigarette smoking but provides little evidence for  associations of reproductive and menstrual factors with meningioma risk. The  relationship between current use of exogenous hormones and meningioma remains  unclear, limited by the small numbers of patients currently on oral hormone  medications and a lack of hormone receptor data for meningioma tumors."", 'OBJECTIVE: To determine the risk of osteoporosis in patients with myasthenia  gravis (MG) in a large cohort representing 99% of the population of Taiwan. METHODS: Data from the Taiwan National Health Insurance Research Database were  used to conduct retrospective cohort analyses. The study cohort consisted of  2,073 patients with MG who were 3-fold frequency-matched by age and sex and  assigned the same index year as a comparison cohort without MG. Cox proportional  hazard regression analysis was conducted to estimate the risk of osteoporosis. RESULTS: The MG cohort had a 1.96-fold increased risk of developing osteoporosis  compared with the comparison cohort (hazard ratio [HR] = 1.96, 95% confidence  interval [CI] = 1.57-2.44). Patients with MG older than 30 years developed an  increased risk of osteoporosis, with the highest risk in the age group from 30  to 44 years, compared with the control cohort. Corticosteroid-naïve patients  with MG had a 1.52-fold increased risk of developing osteoporosis (HR = 1.52,  95% CI = 1.11-2.08), and the corticosteroid-treated cohort had a 2.37-fold  increased risk of developing osteoporosis (HR = 2.37, 95% CI = 1.82-3.07). CONCLUSION: This population-based retrospective cohort study provides evidence  that MG is associated with a high risk of osteoporosis regardless of  corticosteroid use.', 'In this study, we compared subjective fracture risks of Hungarian women with  osteoporosis to FRAX®-based estimates. Patients with a previous fracture,  parental hip fracture, low femoral T-score, higher age, and higher BMI were more  likely to underestimate their risks. Patients also failed to associate risk  factors with an increased risk of fractures. PURPOSE: The main objectives were to explore associations between self-perceived  10-year fracture risks of women with osteoporosis (OP) and their risks  calculated by the FRAX® algorithm and to identify determinants of the  underestimation of risk. METHODS: We carried out a cross-sectional study in 11 OP centers in Hungary and  collected data on the risk factors considered by the FRAX® calculator. Patients  estimated their subjective 10-year probability of any major osteoporotic and hip  fracture numerically, in percentages and also on a visual analog scale (VAS). We  compared subjective and FRAX® estimates and applied logistic regression to  analyze the determinants of the underestimation of risk. Associations between  risk factors and subjective risk were explored using linear probability models. RESULTS: Nine hundred seventy-two OP patients were included in the analysis.  Major OP and hip fracture risk by FRAX® were on average 20.1 and 10.5%, while  subjective estimates were significantly higher, 30.0 and 24.7%, respectively.  Correlations between FRAX® and subjective measures were very weak  (r\xa0=\xa00.12-0.16). Underestimation of major OP fracture risk was associated with  having had a single previous fracture (OR\xa0=\xa02.0), parental hip fracture  (OR\xa0=\xa03.4), femoral T-score ≤-2.5 (OR\xa0=\xa04.2), higher age, body mass index, and  better general health state. We did not find significant associations between  subjective risk estimates and most of the risk factors except for previous  fractures. CONCLUSIONS: Hungarian OP patients fail to recognize most of the risk factors of  fractures. Thus, education of patients about these risk factors would be  beneficial especially for the elderly with a low femoral T-score and parental  hip fracture history.', 'Insulin-like growth factor 1 (IGF-1) is a determinant of bone mass and is  inversely associated with vertebral fractures (VFs). Sclerostin regulates bone  formation by inhibiting Wnt/β-catenin signaling. Currently, there is little  information on circulating sclerostin levels among postmenopausal women with  type-2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) with VFs in relation to serum IGF-1 (s-IGF-1).  We investigated the relationships between serum sclerostin, s-IGF-1, and VFs in  postmenopausal women with T2DM. We assessed cross-sectionally 482 postmenopausal  women with T2DM and 482 age-matched postmenopausal women without T2DM who were  recruited at diabetic clinics and primary health care centers for inclusion in a  bone health survey. The main outcome measures were serum sclerostin, s-IGF-1,  bone mineral density (BMD), and bone turnover markers. Lateral X-rays of the  thoracic and lumbar spine were taken to diagnose VFs. Serum sclerostin levels  were increased, whereas s-IGF-1 levels were decreased when T2DM women were  stratified by the number of VFs (P<0.0001). Multiple logistic regression  analysis showed that serum sclerostin levels were positively associated with 1  VF (odds ratio [OR]=1.27, (95% CI:1.01-2.03), P=0.016), 2 VFs (OR=1.41, (95%  CI:1.03-2.36), P=0.006), and ≥3 VFs (OR=1.54, (95% CI:1.12-2.44) P=0.005).  s-IGF-1 levels were inversely associated with 1 VF (OR=0.58, (95% CI:0.39-0.88),  P=0.041), 2 VFs (OR=0.42, (95% CI:0.21-0.90), P=0.012), and ≥3 VFs (OR=0.19,  (95% CI: 0.14-0.27), P<0.001). Increased serum sclerostin and decreased s-IGF-1  were associated with VFs among postmenopausal women with T2DM, suggesting that  sclerostin and/or IGF-1 may be involved in increased bone fragility in T2DM and  could be potential markers of VF severity.']","Yes, prolactinomas increase risk of osteoporosis.

159,List symptoms of Allgrove syndrome.,"['BACKGROUND: Triple A syndrome (or Allgrove syndrome) is a rare autosomal  recessive disorder characterized by alacrima, achalasia, adrenal insufficiency  and autonomic/neurological abnormalities. The majority of cases are caused by  mutations in the AAAS gene located on chromosome 12q13. However, the clinical  picture as well as genetic testing may be complex since symptomatology is  variable and mutations cannot be identified in all clinically diagnosed  patients. We present two unrelated patients with triple-A syndrome illustrating  the importance of alacrima as an early clinical sign. CASE PRESENTATION: A 3.5\xa0year old girl presented with repeated hypoglycaemic  myoclonic events. Adrenal insufficiency was diagnosed. In addition, alacrima,  obvious since early infancy, was incidentally reported by the mother and finally  lead to the clinical diagnosis of triple A syndrome. This was confirmed by  positive mutation analysis of the AAAS gene. The second patient, an 8\xa0months old  boy was presented because of anisocoria and unilateral optic atrophy. MRI  revealed cerebellar vermis hypotrophy. Psychomotor retardation, failure to  thrive, and frequent vomiting lead to further diagnostic work-up. Achalasia was  diagnosed radiologically. In addition, the mother mentioned absence of tears  since birth leading to the clinical diagnosis of triple A syndrome. In contrast  to the first cases genetic testing was negative. CONCLUSION: These two patients illustrate the heterogeneity of triple A syndrome  in both terms, clinical expression and genetic testing. We particularly aim to  stress the importance of alacrima, which should be considered as a red flag  symptom. Further differential diagnosis is required in every child affected by  alacrima.', 'Allgrove syndrome (or triple-A syndrome) is a rare autosomal recessive disorder  characterized by alacrima, achalasia, adrenal insufficiency (glucocorticoid in  the majority of cases) and autonomic/neurological abnormalities. This disease is  now known to be caused by mutation in the AAAS gene located on chromosome 12q13.  Diagnosis should be readily available when the full-blown features are there,  but it becomes less apparent when presentation is atypical or in the evolving  process. We present a brother and sister (12 and 19 y old, respectively) born to  consanguineous parents of Palestinian origin with Allgrove syndrome. The index  patient was erroneously diagnosed to be a case of familial dysautonomia before  the diagnosis of adrenal insufficiency was made at the age of 7.5 y, while his  elder sister had only alacrima from birth and developed achalasia at the age of  15 y. She started to develop early evidence of adrenal disease at the age of 19  y. Both of them had neuroautonomic dysfunction. The diagnosis of Allgrove  syndrome was confirmed in these two patients by studying the gene mutation in  the family. The sequencing of the AAAS gene in the two patients identified a  novel homozygous mutation within intron 5 (IVS5+1G-->A). Both parents as well as  all three other children were heterozygous for the same mutation. CONCLUSION: These two cases illustrate the heterogenous nature and the  intrafamilial phenotypic variability of Allgrove syndrome.', 'Triple A syndrome (TAS) or Allgrove syndrome (OMIM #231550) is a rare autosomal  recessive disorder characterised by adrenocorticotropic hormone-resistant  adrenal insufficiency, alacrima, achalasia, and neurological and dermatological  abnormalities. Mutations in the AAAS gene on chromosome 12q13 encoding the  nuclear pore protein ALADIN have been reported in these patients. Between 2006  and 2017, we evaluated six patients with a clinical diagnosis of TAS, based on  the presence of at least two symptoms, usually adrenal insufficiency and  alacrima. In all cases, genetic analysis revealed homozygous mutations in the  AAAS gene. One novel mutation was detected: a homozygous 10-bp deletion  (c.1264_1273del, p.Q422NfsX126) in exon 14 of the AAAS gene that caused a  frameshift that introduced an aberrant stop codon after 126 amino acids. This  genetic variant is likely to be pathogenic because it caused a significant  change in protein structure. A precise genotype-phenotype correlation was  impossible to establish. CONCLUSIONS: Based on our experience, we recommend that molecular analysis  should be performed in the presence of alacrima and at least one more symptom of  TAS. Our cases share many clinical features of TAS and underline the variability  in this syndrome, as well as the need for thorough investigation following a  multidisciplinary approach. What is known: • Triple A syndrome is characterised  by achalasia, alacrima, adrenal insufficiency, neurological impairment, and  dermatological abnormalities. • A precise genotype-phenotype correlation has  proved impossible to establish. What is new: • These cases add to a large number  of similar case reports with limited novel information. • The newly identified  AAAS gene mutation was reported.', 'Background Triple A syndrome is characterized by achalasia, alacrima and adrenal  insufficiency with neurological manifestations occurring later in the course of  the disease. It occurs due to biallelic mutations in the AAAS gene which codes  for the nuclear pore protein ALADIN. A number of other features have been  reported over time in this heterogeneous and multisystemic disorder. Unlike  other autosomal recessive disorders, triple A syndrome patients show a wide  phenotypic variability both among different patients and family members  harboring the same mutation(s). A gene-environment interaction has been thought  to be a plausible cause. Methods A retrospective analysis of six families and  seven patients presenting with triple A syndrome was carried out. The clinical,  biochemical and molecular testing data were collected and correlated. The  results of treatment and follow-up and genetic counseling of the families were  obtained wherever feasible. Results Our cohort consisted mostly of children and  displayed a wide phenotypic variability in the presenting symptoms ranging from  hypoglycemic seizures at the severe end of the spectrum to insidious  hyperpigmentation and delayed development. Neurological and autonomic features  were present in a few patients, suggesting requirement of prolonged follow-up  for these patients. A significant gap between the onset of symptoms and  confirmatory diagnosis was noted, suggesting that a high index of suspicion is  required for diagnosing this disorder. Sudden unexplained death was observed in  siblings, and early diagnosis and treatment could help in preventing early  mortality and improving the quality of life for these patients. Conclusion High  index of suspicion for a potentially treatable disorder allows early appropriate  intervention.', ""Achalasia, a poorly relaxing lower esophageal sphincter, produces a functional  obstruction and the expected symptoms of dysphagia, regurgitation and eventually  weight loss. The cause of achalasia remains largely unknown in Western  countries, Chagas' disease being the most frequent etiology in Brazil. We report  on two sets of monozygotic male twins with typical manifestations of achalasia.  The majority of authors attribute a limited contribution unless achalasia is  related to a multisystem disorder, like the triple-A or Allgrove's syndrome, an  autosomal recessive disease characterized by the triad of adrenocorticotropic  hormone (ACTH) resistant adrenal insufficiency, achalasia and alacrima. The four  cases reported demonstrated the genetic influence of achalasia in patients  without multisystem disorders.

160,what is the role of MEF-2 in cardiomyocyte differentiation?,"['Histone deacetylase (HDAC) inhibitors are promising new epi-drugs, but the  presence of both class I and class II enzymes in HDAC complexes precludes a  detailed elucidation of the individual HDAC functions. By using the class  II-specific HDAC inhibitor MC1568, we separated class I- and class II-dependent  effects and defined the roles of class II enzymes in muscle differentiation in  cultured cells and in vivo. MC1568 arrests myogenesis by (i) decreasing myocyte  enhancer factor 2D (MEF2D) expression, (ii) by stabilizing the HDAC4-HDAC3-MEF2D  complex, and (iii) paradoxically, by inhibiting differentiation-induced MEF2D  acetylation. In vivo MC1568 shows an apparent tissue-selective HDAC inhibition.  In skeletal muscle and heart, MC1568 inhibits the activity of HDAC4 and HDAC5  without affecting HDAC3 activity, thereby leaving MEF2-HDAC complexes in a  repressed state. Our results suggest that HDAC class II-selective inhibitors  might have a therapeutic potential for the treatment of muscle and heart  diseases.', 'The myocyte enhancer factor-2 (MEF2) proteins are MADS-box transcription factors  that are essential for differentiation of all muscle lineages but their  mechanisms of action remain largely undefined. In mammals, the earliest site of  MEF2 expression is the heart where the MEF2C isoform is detectable as early as  embryonic day 7.5. Inactivation of the MEF2C gene causes cardiac developmental  arrest and severe downregulation of a number of cardiac markers including atrial  natriuretic factor (ANF). However, most of these promoters contain no or low  affinity MEF2 binding sites and they are not significantly activated by any MEF2  proteins in heterologous cells suggesting a dependence on a cardiac-enriched  cofactor for MEF2 action. We provide evidence that MEF2 proteins are recruited  to target promoters by the cell-specific GATA transcription factors, and that  MEF2 potentiates the transcriptional activity of this family of  tissue-restricted zinc finger proteins. Functional MEF2/GATA-4 synergy involves  physical interaction between the MEF2 DNA-binding domain and the carboxy zinc  finger of GATA-4 and requires the activation domains of both proteins. However,  neither MEF2 binding sites nor MEF2 DNA binding capacity are required for  transcriptional synergy. The results unravel a novel pathway for transcriptional  regulation by MEF2 and provide a molecular paradigm for elucidating the  mechanisms of action of MEF2 in muscle and non-muscle cells.', 'The calcium/calmodulin-dependent protein phosphatase calcineurin is required for  the induction of transcriptional events that initiate and promote myogenic  differentiation. An important effector for calcineurin in striated muscle is the  transcription factor myocyte enhancer factor 2 (MEF2). The targeting of the  enzyme and substrate to specific intracellular compartments by scaffold proteins  often confers specificity in phosphatase activity. We now show that the  scaffolding protein mAKAP organizes a calcineurin/MEF2 signaling complex in  myocytes, regulating gene transcription. A calcineurin/mAKAP/MEF2 complex can be  isolated from C2C12 cells and cardiac myocytes, and the calcineurin/MEF2  association is dependent on mAKAP expression. We have identified a peptide  comprising the calcineurin binding domain in mAKAP that can disrupt the binding  of the phosphatase to the scaffold in vivo. Dominant interference of  calcineurin/mAKAP binding blunts the increase in MEF2 transcriptional activity  seen during myoblast differentiation, as well as the expression of endogenous  MEF2-target genes. Furthermore, disruption of calcineurin binding to mAKAP in  cardiac myocytes inhibits adrenergic-induced cellular hypertrophy. Together  these data illustrate the importance of calcineurin anchoring by the mAKAP  scaffold for MEF2 regulation.', 'The growth and differentiation factor bone morphogenetic protein-2 (BMP-2)  regulates cardiac development during vertebrate embryogenesis. In cardiac  precursor cells, BMP-2 has recently been shown to induce expression of cardiac  transcription factors, including myocyte enhancer factor 2A (MEF-2A). The  specific signal transduction mechanism by which BMP-2 regulates these actions is  not known. We investigated the role of phosphatidylinositol (PI) 3-kinase in  regulating these processes in cardiomyocyte precursor CL6 cells. BMP-2 increased  PI 3-kinase activity in these cells in a time-dependent manner, resulting in  increased expression of sarcomeric myosin heavy chain (MHC) and MEF-2A.  Inhibition of PI 3-kinase abolished these actions of BMP-2, indicating the  involvement of PI 3-kinase in these processes. Furthermore, BMP-2 stimulated  specific protein.DNA complex formation when an MEF-2 DNA recognition element was  used as probe. Antibody supershift assay confirmed the presence of MEF-2A in  this protein.DNA complex. Inhibition of PI 3-kinase activity completely  prevented the MEF-2A.DNA complex formation. BMP-2 also increased transcription  of a reporter gene driven by an MEF-2-specific DNA element in a PI  3-kinase-dependent manner. Ectopic expression of MEF-2A increased BMP-2  transcription to the same extent induced by BMP-2, indicating that MEF-2A may  participate in BMP-2 autoregulation in CL6 cells. Expression of dominant  negative PI 3-kinase completely abolished BMP-2-induced as well as  MEF-2A-mediated BMP-2 transcription. Furthermore expression of MEF-2A increased  MHC expression in a PI 3-kinase-dependent manner. Together these data provide  the first evidence that BMP-2-induced PI 3-kinase signaling regulates MEF-2A  expression and define a mechanism of MEF-2A-dependent BMP-2 transcription.', 'The Myocyte Enhancer Factor-2 (MEF2) family of transcription factors regulates  gene expression during cardiomyocyte differentiation and adaptation of the  myocardium to stress. MEF2 activity is enhanced by increasing its transcription  and by MAPK-dependent phosphorylation, and is reduced by binding to class-II  Histone Deacetylases and by miR-1-mediated degradation of its transcript. Here  we show that MEF2 protein abundance is regulated at the translational level,  determining myocyte size, during hypertrophy. In order to reduce MEF2 protein  expression, its silencing through RNA interference required serum deprivation  and, even in this condition, MEF2 protein abundance recovered to basal levels in  presence of phenylephrine. Hypertrophic agonist stimulation of neonatal  ventricular cardiomyocytes increased Mef2 expression by enhancing its  translation, without changing its transcription or blocking degradation of the  protein. MEF2 abundance was increased by Calcineurin overexpression in vivo and  was reduced by Calcineurin inhibition in vitro, without affecting Mef2 mRNA  levels. Calcineurin activity influenced expression of Polypyrimidine Tract  Protein (PTB), contributing to MEF2 translation. Thus, our results show a  previously unrecognized but relevant level of MEF2 activity regulation through  the control of its translation that involves Calcineurin and PTB.', 'The simultaneous overexpression of several transcription factors has emerged as  a successful strategy to convert fibroblasts into other cell types including  pluripotent cells, neurons, and cardiomyocytes. The selection and screening of  factors are critical, and have often involved testing a large pool of  transcription factors, followed by successive removal of single factors. Here,  to identify a cardiac transcription factor combination facilitating mouse  fibroblast reprogramming into cardiomyocytes, we directly screened all triplet  combinations of 10 candidate factors combined with a Q-PCR assay reporting  induction of multiple cardiac-specific genes. Through this screening method the  combination of Tbx5, Mef2c, and Myocd was identified to upregulate a broader  spectrum of cardiac genes compared to the combination of Tbx5, Mef2c, and Gata4  that was recently shown to induce reprogramming of fibroblasts into  cardiomyocytes. Cells cotransduced with Tbx5, Mef2c, Myocd expressed cardiac  contractile proteins, had cardiac-like potassium and sodium currents and action  potentials could be elicited. In summary the alternative screening approach that  is presented here avoided the elimination of transcription factors whose potency  is masked in complex transcription factor mixes. Furthermore, our results point  to the importance of verifying multiple lineage specific genes when assessing  reprogramming.', 'RATIONALE: Mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) pathways provide a critical  connection between extrinsic and intrinsic signals to cardiac hypertrophy.  Extracellular signal-regulated protein kinase (ERK)5, an atypical MAPK is  activated in the heart by pressure overload. However, the role of ERK5 plays in  regulating hypertrophic growth and hypertrophy-induced apoptosis is not  completely understood. OBJECTIVE: Herein, we investigate the in vivo role and signaling mechanism  whereby ERK5 regulates cardiac hypertrophy and hypertrophy-induced apoptosis. METHODS AND RESULTS: We generated and examined the phenotypes of mice with  cardiomyocyte-specific deletion of the erk5 gene (ERK5(cko)). In response to  hypertrophic stress, ERK5(cko) mice developed less hypertrophic growth and  fibrosis than controls. However, increased apoptosis together with upregulated  expression levels of p53 and Bad were observed in the mutant hearts.  Consistently, we found that silencing ERK5 expression or specific inhibition of  its kinase activity using BIX02189 in neonatal rat cardiomyocytes (NRCMs)  reduced myocyte enhancer factor (MEF)2 transcriptional activity and blunted  hypertrophic responses. Furthermore, the inhibition of MEF2 activity in NRCMs  using a non-DNA binding mutant form of MEF2 was found to attenuate the  ERK5-regulated hypertrophic response. CONCLUSIONS: These results reveal an important function of ERK5 in cardiac  hypertrophic remodeling and cardiomyocyte survival. The role of ERK5 in  hypertrophic remodeling is likely to be mediated via the regulation of MEF2  activity.', 'The molecular determinants that direct gene expression to the ventricles of the  heart are for the most part unknown. Additionally, little data is available on  how the anterior/posterior axis of the heart tube is determined and whether the  left and right atrial and ventricular chambers are assigned as part of this  process. Utilizing myosin light chain-2 ventricular promoter/beta-galactosidase  reporter transgenes, we have determined the minimal cis-acting sequences  required for ventricular-specific gene expression. In multiple independent  transgenic mouse lines, we found that both a 250 base pair myosin light chain-2  ventricular promoter fragment, as well as a dimerized 28 bp sub-element (HF-1)  containing binding sites for HF1a and HF1b/MEF2 factors, directed  ventricular-specific reporter expression from as early as the endogenous gene,  at day 7.5-8.0 post coitum. While the endogenous gene is expressed uniformly  throughout both ventricles, the transgenes were expressed in a right  ventricular/conotruncal dominant fashion, suggesting that they contain only a  subset of the elements which respond to positional information in the developing  heart tube. Expression of the transgene was cell autonomous and its  temporospatial characteristics not affected by mouse strain/methylation state of  the genome. To determine whether ventricular-specific expression of the  transgene was dependent upon regulatory genes required for correct ventricular  differentiation, the 250 base pair transgene was bred into both retinoid X  receptoralpha and Nkx2-5 null backgrounds. The transgene was expressed in both  mutant backgrounds, despite the absence of endogenous myosin light chain-2  ventricular transcript in Nkx2-5 null embryos. Ventricular specification, as  judged by transgene expression, appeared to occur normally in both mutants.  Thus, the HF-1 element, directs chamber-specific transcription of a transgene  reporter independently of retinoid X receptoralpha and Nkx2-5, and defines a  minimal combinatorial pathway for ventricular chamber gene expression. The  patterned expression of this transgene may provide a model system in which to  investigate the cues that dictate anterior-posterior (right ventricle/left  ventricle) gradients during mammalian heart development.', 'Mitochondrial morphology is crucial for tissue homeostasis, but its role in cell  differentiation is unclear. We found that mitochondrial fusion was required for  proper cardiomyocyte development. Ablation of mitochondrial fusion proteins  Mitofusin 1 and 2 in the embryonic mouse heart, or gene-trapping of Mitofusin 2  or Optic atrophy 1 in mouse embryonic stem cells (ESCs), arrested mouse heart  development and impaired differentiation of ESCs into cardiomyocytes. Gene  expression profiling revealed decreased levels of transcription factors  transforming growth factor-β/bone morphogenetic protein, serum response factor,  GATA4, and myocyte enhancer factor 2, linked to increased Ca(2+)-dependent  calcineurin activity and Notch1 signaling that impaired ESC differentiation.  Orchestration of cardiomyocyte differentiation by mitochondrial morphology  reveals how mitochondria, Ca(2+), and calcineurin interact to regulate Notch1  signaling.', 'Members of the transforming growth factor beta1 (TGF-beta) superfamily--namely,  TGF-beta and BMP2--applied to undifferentiated murine embryonic stem cells  up-regulated mRNA of mesodermal (Brachyury) and cardiac specific transcription  factors (Nkx2.5, MEF2C). Embryoid bodies generated from stem cells primed with  these growth factors demonstrated an increased potential for cardiac  differentiation with a significant increase in beating areas and enhanced  myofibrillogenesis. In an environment of postmitotic cardiomyocytes, stem cells  engineered to express a fluorescent protein under the control of a cardiac  promoter differentiated into fluorescent ventricular myocytes beating in  synchrony with host cells, a process significantly enhanced by TGF-beta or BMP2.  In vitro, disruption of the TGF-beta/BMP signaling pathways by  latency-associated peptide and/or noggin prevented differentiation of stem  cells. In fact, only host cells that secrete a TGF-beta family member induced a  cardiac phenotype in stem cells. In vivo, transplantation of stem cells into  heart also resulted in cardiac differentiation provided that TGF-beta/BMP2  signaling was intact. In infarcted myocardium, grafted stem cells differentiated  into functional cardiomyocytes integrated with surrounding tissue, improving  contractile performance. Thus, embryonic stem cells are directed to  differentiate into cardiomyocytes by signaling mediated through TGF-beta/BMP2, a  cardiac paracrine pathway required for therapeutic benefit of stem cell  transplantation in diseased heart.']","The myocyte enhancer factor-2 (MEF2) proteins are MADS-box transcription factors that are essential for differentiation of all muscle lineages but their mechanisms of action remain largely undefined. MEF2C expression initiates cardiomyogenesis, resulting in the up-regulation of Brachyury T, bone morphogenetic protein-4, Nkx2-5, GATA-4, cardiac alpha-actin, and myosin heavy chain expression. Inactivation of the MEF2C gene causes cardiac developmental arrest and severe downregulation of a number of cardiac markers including atrial natriuretic factor (ANF). BMP-2, a regulator of cardiac development during embryogenesis, was shown to increase PI 3-kinase activity in cardiac precursor cells, resulting in increased expression of sarcomeric myosin heavy chain (MHC) and MEF-2A. Furthermore, expression of MEF-2A increased MHC expression in a PI 3-kinase-dependent manner. Other studies showed that Gli2 and MEF2C proteins form a complex, capable of synergizing on cardiomyogenesis-related promoters. Dominant interference of calcineurin/mAKAP binding blunts the increase in MEF2 transcriptional activity seen during myoblast differentiation, as well as the expression of endogenous MEF2-target genes. These findings show that MEF-2 can direct early stages of cell differentiation into a cardiomyogenic pathway."
161,Are mutations in the STXBP1 gene associated with epilepsy?,"['Ohtahara syndrome (OS) is one of the most severe and earliest forms of epilepsy.  We have recently identified that the de novo mutations of STXBP1 are important  causes for OS. Here we report a paternal somatic mosaicism of an STXBP1  mutation. The affected daughter had onset of spasms at 1 month of age, and  interictal electroencephalogram showed suppression-burst pattern, leading to the  diagnosis of OS. She had a heterozygous c.902+5G>A mutation of STXBP1, which  affects donor splicing of exon 10, resulting in 138-bp insertion of intron 10  sequences in the transcript. The mutant transcript had a premature stop codon,  and was degraded by nonsense-mediated mRNA decay in lymphoblastoid cells derived  from the patient. High-resolution melting analysis of clinically unaffected  parental DNAs suggested that the father was somatic mosaic for the mutation,  which was also suggested by sequencing. Cloning of PCR products amplified with  the paternal DNA samples extracted from blood, saliva, buccal cells, and nails  suggested that 5.3%, 8.7%, 11.9%, and 16.9% of alleles harbored the mutation,  respectively. This is a first report of somatic mosaicism of an STXBP1 mutation,  which has implications in genetic counseling of OS.', 'Human epilepsy is a common and heterogeneous condition in which genetics play an  important etiological role. We begin by reviewing the past history of epilepsy  genetics, a field that has traditionally included studies of pedigrees with  epilepsy caused by defects in ion channels and neurotransmitters. We highlight  important recent discoveries that have expanded the field beyond the realm of  channels and neurotransmitters and that have challenged the notion that single  genes produce single disorders. Finally, we project toward an exciting future  for epilepsy genetics as large-scale collaborative phenotyping studies come face  to face with new technologies in genomic medicine.', 'A de novo 9q33.3-q34.11 microdeletion involving STXBP1 has been found in one of  four individuals (group A) with early-onset West syndrome, severe  hypomyelination, poor visual attention, and developmental delay. Although  haploinsufficiency of STXBP1 was involved in early infantile epileptic  encephalopathy in a previous different cohort study (group B), no mutations of  STXBP1 were found in two of the remaining three subjects of group A (one was  unavailable). We assumed that another gene within the deletion might contribute  to the phenotype of group A. SPTAN1 encoding alpha-II spectrin, which is  essential for proper myelination in zebrafish, turned out to be deleted. In two  subjects, an in-frame 3 bp deletion and a 6 bp duplication in SPTAN1 were found  at the initial nucleation site of the alpha/beta spectrin heterodimer. SPTAN1  was further screened in six unrelated individuals with WS and hypomyelination,  but no mutations were found. Recombinant mutant (mut) and wild-type (WT)  alpha-II spectrin could assemble heterodimers with beta-II spectrin, but  alpha-II (mut)/beta-II spectrin heterodimers were thermolabile compared with the  alpha-II (WT)/beta-II heterodimers. Transient expression in mouse cortical  neurons revealed aggregation of alpha-II (mut)/beta-II and alpha-II  (mut)/beta-III spectrin heterodimers, which was also observed in lymphoblastoid  cells from two subjects with in-frame mutations. Clustering of ankyrinG and  voltage-gated sodium channels at axon initial segment (AIS) was disturbed in  relation to the aggregates, together with an elevated action potential  threshold. These findings suggest that pathological aggregation of alpha/beta  spectrin heterodimers and abnormal AIS integrity resulting from SPTAN1 mutations  were involved in pathogenesis of infantile epilepsy.', 'Mutations in STXBP1 gene, encoding the syntaxin binding protein 1, have been  recently described in Ohtahara syndrome, or early infantile epileptic  encephalopathy with suppression-burst pattern, and in other early-onset  epileptic encephalopathies. A 3-year-old boy affected by epileptic  encephalopathy started at 8 months of age is described. Focal epilepsy was  characterized by drug resistance seizures with multifocal interictal and ictal  electroencephalographic (EEG) features and variable EEG focus. Direct sequencing  of the STXBP1 gene showed a novel de novo mutation (c.751G>A), leading to a  p.Ala251Thr substitution.

The present  case further expands the clinical spectrum of ""STXBP1-related encephalopathy""  suggesting molecular analysis of STXBP1 in early onset epileptic  encephalopathies of unknown etiology (with onset within the first year of life).  In addition, the case provides valuable suggestions on seizures treatment in  STXBP1 mutated subjects.', 'PURPOSE: Ohtahara syndrome (OS) is one of the most severe and earliest forms of  epilepsy.

METHODS: Copy number analysis and whole exome sequencing were performed in 34  and 12 patients with OS, respectively. Fluorescence in situ hybridization,  quantitative polymerase chain reaction (PCR), and breakpoint-specific and  reverse-transcriptase PCR analyses were performed to characterize a deletion.  Immunoblotting using lymphoblastoid cells was done to examine expression of CASK  protein. KEY FINDINGS: Genomic microarray analysis revealed a 111-kb deletion involving  exon 2 of CASK at Xp11.4 in a male patient. The deletion was inherited from his  mother, who was somatic mosaic for the deletion. Sequencing of the mutant  transcript expressed in lymphoblastoid cell lines derived from the patient  confirmed the deletion of exon 2 in the mutant transcript with a premature stop  codon.

No CASK protein was  detected by immunoblotting in lymphoblastoid cells derived from two patients. SIGNIFICANCE: The detected mutations are highly likely to cause the loss of  function of the CASK protein in male individuals. CASK mutations have been  reported in patients with intellectual disability with microcephaly and  pontocerebellar hypoplasia or congenital nystagmus, and those with FG syndrome.

Folinic acid-responsive seizures are treatable  causes of Ohtahara syndrome, which is thought to be due to recessive mutations  in the ALDH7A1 gene, resulting in deficiency of antiquitin. METHOD: Here we report a girl with Ohtahara syndrome who exhibited transient  folinic acid responsiveness but without evidence of antiquitin dysfunction. RESULTS: She was later found to have a known missense mutation (c.1439 C > T,  p.P480 L) in exon 16 of the STXBP1 gene. CONCLUSION: For infants presenting with Ohtahara syndrome with responsiveness to  folinic acid and negative antiquitin deficiency analyses, genetic testing for  other possible causative genes such as STXBP1 mutation is recommended.', 'PURPOSE: Ohtahara syndrome (OS) is one of the most severe and earliest forms of  epilepsy.

The variety of unspecific and overlapping syndromic and  nonsyndromic phenotypes often hampers a clear clinical diagnosis and prevents  straightforward genetic testing. Knowing the genetic basis of a patient's  epilepsy can be valuable not only for diagnosis but also for guiding treatment  and estimating recurrence risks. METHODS: To overcome these diagnostic restrictions, we composed a panel of genes  for Next Generation Sequencing containing the most relevant epilepsy genes and  covering the most relevant epilepsy phenotypes known so far. With this method,  265 genes were analyzed per patient in a single step. We evaluated this panel on  a pilot cohort of 33 index patients with concise epilepsy phenotypes or with a  severe but unspecific seizure disorder covering both sporadic and familial  cases. KEY FINDINGS: We identified presumed disease-causing mutations in 16 of 33  patients comprising sequence alterations in frequently as well as in less  commonly affected genes. The detected aberrations encompassed known and unknown  point mutations (SCN1A p.R222X, p. E289V, p.379R, p.R393H; SCN2A p.V208E; STXBP1  p.R122X; KCNJ10 p.L68P, p.I129V; KCTD7 p.L108M; KCNQ3 p.P574S; ARHGEF9 p.R290H;  SMS p.F58L; TPP1 p.Q278R, p.Q422H; MFSD8 p.T294K), a putative splice site  mutation (SCN1A c.693A>\u2003p.T/P231P) and small deletions (SCN1A p.F1330Lfs3X [1  bp]; MFSD8 p.A138Dfs10X [7 bp]). All mutations have been confirmed by  conventional Sanger sequencing and, where possible, validated by parental  testing and segregation analysis. In three patients with either Dravet syndrome  or myoclonic epilepsy, we detected SCN1A mutations (p.R222X, p.P231P, p.R393H),  even though other laboratories had previously excluded aberrations of this gene  by Sanger sequencing or high-resolution melting analysis. SIGNIFICANCE: We have developed a fast and cost-efficient diagnostic screening  method to analyze the genetic basis of epilepsies. We were able to detect  mutations in patients with clear and with unspecific epilepsy phenotypes, to  uncover the genetic basis of many so far unresolved cases with epilepsy  including mutation detection in cases in which previous conventional methods  yielded falsely negative results. Our approach thus proved to be a powerful  diagnostic tool that may contribute to collecting information on both common and  unknown epileptic disorders and in delineating associated phenotypes of less  frequently mutated genes."", 'Mutations in the SCN1A gene are found in up to 80% of individuals with severe  myoclonic epilepsy of infancy (SMEI), and mutations in KCNQ2 and KCNQ3 were  identified in benign familial neonatal convulsions (BFNC) as well as in single  families with Rolandic epilepsy (RE) and idiopathic generalized epilepsies  (IGE). This paper summarizes recent findings concerning sodium (SCN1A) and  potassium channel (KCNQ2 and KCNQ3) dysfunctions in the pathogenesis of rare and  common idiopathic epilepsies (IE). SMEI, severe idiopathic generalized epilepsy  of infancy (SIGEI), and myoclonic-astatic epilepsy (MAE) are rare IE. Because of  some semeiologic overlap, a comparative analysis of the SCN1A gene performed in  20 patients with MAE and in 18 with SIGEI. This revealed mutations in three  subjects with SIGEI only. Since BFNC are over-represented in families with RE, a  mutational analysis was performed in 58 families with RE with and without BNFC.  This revealed functionally relevant mutations in two index cases with BNFC, and  three missense mutations (one resulting in a significantly reduced potassium  current amplitude) in three patients with RE, but without BNFC. One KCNQ3  missense variant was also detected in eight out of 455 IGE patients but not in  454 controls, and a silent KCNQ2-SNP was found over-represented in both epilepsy  samples. These findings confirm that mutations in the SCN1A gene are mainly  involved in the pathogenesis of SMEI, rarely in that of SIGEI, and are commonly  not found in patients with MAE. They also demonstrate that sequence variations  of the KCNQ2 and KCNQ3 genes may contribute to the etiology of common IE  syndromes.']","Yes,mutations in STXBP1 gene, encoding the syntaxin binding protein 1, have been recently described in Ohtahara syndrome, or early infantile epileptic encephalopathy with suppression-burst pattern, and in other early-onset epileptic encephalopathies."
162,Is sacituzumab govitecan effective for breast cancer?,"['Patients with metastatic triple-negative breast cancer have a poor prognosis.  Sacituzumab govitecan (IMMU-132) is an antibody-drug conjugate that contains the  irinotecan active metabolite, SN-38, linked to a humanized monoclonal antibody  targeting trophoblast cell surface antigen 2, which is overexpressed in many  solid tumors. In a basket design phase I/II study, sacituzumab govitecan  demonstrated promising single-agent therapeutic activity in multiple cancer  cohorts, leading to accelerated approval by the U.S. Food and Drug  Administration of sacituzumab govitecan-hziy (TRODELVY) for the treatment of  patients with metastatic triple-negative breast cancer who had received at least  two prior therapies in the metastatic setting. Recently, results of the phase  III trial, ASCENT, were confirmatory. There is limited available information on  the adverse event management with sacituzumab govitecan needed to maximize the  dose and duration of effective therapy while maintaining patient quality of  life. This review summarizes the clinical development and the practical  management of patients receiving sacituzumab govitecan. Sacituzumab govitecan  has a well-defined and manageable toxicity profile, and rapid recognition and  appropriate early and proactive management will allow clinicians to optimize  sacituzumab govitecan treatment for patients. IMPLICATIONS FOR PRACTICE:  Sacituzumab govitecan (TRODELVY) is a novel antibody-drug conjugate composed of  the active metabolite of irinotecan (SN-38) conjugated to a monoclonal antibody  targeting trophoblast cell surface antigen 2, an epithelial cell surface antigen  overexpressed in many cancers. Because of the rapid approval of sacituzumab  govitecan, there is limited available information on adverse event (AE)  management with this agent. As such, this article reviews the clinical  development of the drug, the AE profile, and provides recommendations regarding  AE management to help optimize therapy with sacituzumab govitecan.', 'Patients with metastatic triple-negative breast cancer (mTNBC) that has  progressed on first-line therapy have a poor prognosis with limited therapeutic  options.

It has received breakthrough therapy status by the U.S. Food and Drug  Administration (FDA) for the treatment of patients with pretreated mTNBC. In  this review, we summarize available data regarding the pharmacology,  pharmacokinetics, safety and efficacy of SG and describe ongoing and future  clinical studies investigating this agent.', 'Sacituzumab govitecan (sacituzumab govitecan-hziy; Trodelvy™) is a  Trop-2-directed antibody conjugated to a topoisomerase I inhibitor (SN-38) that  is being developed by Immunomedics for the treatment of solid tumours, including  breast cancer.

Sacituzumab govitecan is an antibody drug conjugate (ADC)  comprised of an active metabolite of irinotecan, SN-38, bound to a humanized  monoclonal antibody targeting trophoblastic cell-surface antigen 2 (Trop-2).  Trop-2 is highly expressed on the surface of TNBC cells, making it an attractive  target.

A literature search was conducted via  PubMed using keywords such as 'sacituzumab govitecan,' and 'metastatic TNBC.'  Expert opinion Sacituzumab govitecan has promising survival benefits in patients  with previously treated mTNBC based on data from the ASCENT trial. Common  adverse effects were neutropenia, diarrhea, and nausea, however these effects  were manageable with supportive care. Sacituzumab govitecan has shown promise in  cancers outside of TNBC, such as urothelial and lung and is being evaluated in  HR-positive breast cancers.

Uridine  diphosphate glucuronosyltransferase family 1 member A1 poor metabolizers are at  increased risk for profound neutropenia. This case discusses clinical  implications of the uridine diphosphate glucuronosyltransferase family 1 member  A1*28/*28 genotype in patients receiving sacituzumab govitecan-hziy. CASE REPORT: A 38-year-old otherwise healthy pre-menopausal female of South  Asian descent was diagnosed with non-metastatic, hormone receptor-positive, and  human epidermal growth factor receptor 2-negative breast cancer. This was  treated with neoadjuvant chemotherapy and multiple lines of subsequent  therapies. Upon finding bone metastasis, an additional six lines of therapy  ensued. In total, 3.5 years post-diagnosis, sacituzumab govitecan-hziy was  started for disease transformation to triple-negative status. MANAGEMENT AND OUTCOME: Sacituzumab govitecan-hziy was initiated at the Food and  Drug Administration-approved 10\u2005mg/kg/dose on days 1 and 8 of a 21-day cycle.  Grade 4 neutropenia occurred after one dose. Pharmacogenomics testing identified  the patient as a uridine diphosphate glucuronosyltransferase family 1 member  A1*28 homozygous expressor. Sacituzumab govitecan-hziy was dose-reduced, and  granulocyte colony-stimulating factor was administered due to the severity of  neutropenia. The patient continued on sacituzumab govitecan-hziy until disease  progression. DISCUSSION: Sacituzumab govitecan-hziy's propensity to cause neutropenia is  multifactorial. Although incidence of all-grade neutropenia from sacituzumab  govitecan-hziy is elevated for uridine diphosphate glucuronosyltransferase  family 1 member A1*28 homozygous expressors, this does not translate to  increased risk for febrile neutropenia. Detailed guidance is lacking regarding  empiric dose adjustments or prophylactic granulocyte colony-stimulating factor  for these patients.1 Currently, pre-sacituzumab govitecan-hziy pharmacogenomics  testing to identify uridine diphosphate glucuronosyltransferase family 1 member  A1 poor metabolizers is not recommended, and the cost-effectiveness of this  approach is unclear."", 'BACKGROUND: Necitumumab is a second-generation recombinant human immunoglobulin  G1 EGFR monoclonal antibody that competitively inhibits ligand binding. We aimed  to compare necitumumab plus pemetrexed and cisplatin with pemetrexed and  cisplatin alone in patients with previously untreated, stage IV, non-squamous  non-small-cell lung cancer (NSCLC). METHODS: We did this randomised, open-label, controlled phase 3 study at 103  sites in 20 countries. Patients aged 18 years or older, with an Eastern  Cooperative Oncology Group (ECOG) performance status of 0-2 and adequate organ  function, were randomly assigned 1:1 to treatment with a block randomisation  scheme (block size of four) via a telephone-based interactive voice-response  system or interactive web-response system. Patients received either cisplatin 75  mg/m(2) and pemetrexed 500 mg/m(2) on day 1 of a 3-week cycle for a maximum of  six cycles alone, or with necitumumab 800 mg on days 1 and 8. Necitumumab was  continued after the end of chemotherapy until disease progression or  unacceptable toxic effects. Randomisation was stratified by smoking history,  ECOG performance status, disease histology, and geographical region. Patients  and study investigators were not masked to group assignment. The primary  endpoint was overall survival. Efficacy analyses were by intention to treat.  This trial is registered with ClinicalTrials.gov, number NCT00982111. FINDINGS: Between Nov 11, 2009, and Feb 2, 2011, we randomly assigned 633  patients to receive either necitumumab plus pemetrexed and cisplatin (n=315) or  pemetrexed and cisplatin alone (n=318). Enrolment was stopped on Feb 2, 2011,  after a recommendation from the independent data monitoring committee. There was  no significant difference in overall survival between treatment groups, with a  median overall survival of 11·3 months (95% CI 9·5-13·4) in the necitumumab plus  pemetrexed and cisplatin group versus 11·5 months (10·1-13·1) in the pemetrexed  and cisplatin group (hazard ratio 1·01 [95% CI 0·84-1·21]; p=0·96). The  incidence of grade 3 or worse adverse events, including deaths, was higher in  the necitumumab plus pemetrexed and cisplatin group than in the pemetrexed and  cisplatin group; in particular, deaths regarded as related to study drug were  reported in 15 (5%) of 304 patients in the necitumumab group versus nine (3%) of  312 patients in the pemetrexed and cisplatin group. Serious adverse events were  likewise more frequent in the necitumumab plus pemetrexed and cisplatin group  than in the pemetrexed and cisplatin group (155 [51%] of 304 vs 127 [41%] of 312  patients). Patients in the necitumumab plus pemetrexed and cisplatin group had  more grade 3-4 rash (45 [15%] of 304 vs one [<1%] of 312 patients in the  pemetrexed and cisplatin alone group), hypomagnesaemia (23 [8%] vs seven [2%]  patients), and grade 3 or higher venous thromboembolic events (23 [8%] vs 11  [4%] patients) than did those in the pemetrexed and cisplatin alone group. INTERPRETATION: Our findings show no evidence to suggest that the addition of  necitumumab to pemetrexed and cisplatin increases survival of previously  untreated patients with stage IV non-squamous NSCLC. Unless future studies  identify potentially useful predictive biomarkers, necitumumab is unlikely to  provide benefit in this patient population when combined with pemetrexed and  cisplatin. FUNDING: Eli Lilly and Company.', 'BACKGROUND: A previously published prospective randomized phase 3 trial showed  that administration of 24 weeks of primary systemic chemotherapy (PST) with  paclitaxel and FEC(75) (fluorouracil, epirubicin, cyclophosphamide) concurrently  with trastuzumab in patients with HER2-positive primary breast cancer resulted  in a 60% pathologic complete response rate (PCR) with no associated severe  cardiac toxicity. The purpose of this study was to review the efficacy and  safety of a similar regimen outside the setting of a clinical trial. METHODS: Patients with HER2-positive breast cancer (defined as either  immunohistochemical 3+ or fluorescence in situ hybridization-positive) that had  received 24 weeks of neoadjuvant trastuzumab concurrently with taxane and  anthracycline-based chemotherapy between 2004 and 2006 were included in the  analysis. PST chemotherapy consisted of paclitaxel (80 mg/m(2)) weekly for 12  weeks followed by 4 cycles of FEC(75) (500 mg/m(2), 75 mg/m(2), and 500 mg/m(2),  respectively). RESULTS: Forty patients were identified. The median age was 48 years (range,  29-81). In all, 60% of patients had stage III disease and 4 had inflammatory  breast cancer. The PCR rate was 55% (95% confidence interval [CI], 38.5%-70.7%).  At a median follow-up of 19 months. 5 patients had a recurrence, of which 4 did  not achieve a PCR. No severe cardiac events were observed. CONCLUSIONS: Stage II and III HER2-positive breast cancer patients achieved a  high rate of PCR with trastuzumab given concurrently with paclitaxel and FEC(75)  chemotherapy. No severe cardiac events were observed with the regimen. The data  concur with the results of a previously published trial.', 'BACKGROUND: Approximately 40% of hormone receptor-positive, HER2-negative breast  cancers (BCs) are associated with activating mutations of the  phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase (PI3K) pathway. Pictilisib, a potent and highly  specific class I pan-PI3K inhibitor, demonstrated preclinical activity in BC  cell lines and may potentiate the effect of taxanes, benefiting patients with or  without aberrant activation of the PI3K pathway. PEGGY (NCT01740336), a  randomised, placebo-controlled phase II trial, examined whether pictilisib  augments the anti-tumour activity of paclitaxel in patients with hormone  receptor-positive, HER2-negative locally recurrent or metastatic BC (mBC). We  report results from the protocol-specified interim analysis. PATIENTS AND METHODS: One hundred and eighty-three eligible patients were  randomised (1:1) to receive paclitaxel (90 mg/m2 weekly for 3 weeks in every  28-day cycle) with either 260 mg pictilisib or placebo (daily on days 1-5 every  week). The primary end point was progression-free survival (PFS) in the  intention-to-treat (ITT) population and patients with PIK3CA-mutated tumours.  Secondary end points included overall response rate (ORR), duration of response,  and safety. RESULTS: In the ITT population, the median PFS was 8.2 months with pictilisib (n  = 91) versus 7.8 months with placebo (n = 92) [hazard ratio (HR) for progression  or death, 0.95; 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.62-1.46; P = 0.83]. In patients  with PIK3CA-mutated tumours, the median PFS was 7.3 months for pictilisib (n =  32) versus 5.8 months with placebo (n = 30) (HR, 1.06; 95% CI 0.52-2.12; P =  0.88). ORR was similar between treatment arms. The safety profile of pictilisib  was consistent with previous reports, with no new safety signals. Proportions of  patients with grade ≥3 adverse events (AEs), serious AEs, and dose  reductions/discontinuations due to AEs were higher with pictilisib. CONCLUSIONS: PEGGY did not meet its primary end point, revealing no significant  benefit from adding pictilisib to paclitaxel for patients with hormone  receptor-positive, HER2-negative locally recurrent or mBC. CLINICAL TRIAL NUMBER: NCT01740336.', 'OBJECTIVE: The primary objective of this study was to determine the rate of  response to matuzumab in patients with recurrent, EGFR-positive ovarian, or  primary peritoneal cancer. Secondary end points included safety and  tolerability, time to tumor progression, duration of response, and overall  survival. METHODS: A multi-institutional single arm phase II trial. RESULTS: Of 75 women screened for the study, 37 were enrolled and treated.  Median age of the treated patient population was 58 years, and most patients had  more than four prior lines of chemotherapy. Therapy was well tolerated, the most  common toxicities being a constellation of skin toxicities, including rash,  acne, dry skin, and paronychia, as well as headache, fatigue, and diarrhea.  Serious adverse events were very rare but included a single episode of  pancreatitis that may have been drug related. All patients completed therapy,  receiving 1 to 30 infusions of matuzumab. There were no formal responses (RR=0%,  95% CI: 0-9.5%), although 7 patients (21%) were on therapy for more than 3  months with stable disease. CONCLUSIONS: Matuzumab at the dose and schedule selected is well tolerated. In  this population of very heavily pretreated patients with epithelial ovarian and  primary peritoneal malignancies, there was no evidence of significant clinical  activity when matuzumab was administered as monotherapy.', 'BACKGROUND: Necitumumab is a second-generation, recombinant, human  immunoglobulin G1 EGFR antibody. In this study, we aimed to compare treatment  with necitumumab plus gemcitabine and cisplatin versus gemcitabine and cisplatin  alone in patients with previously untreated stage IV squamous non-small-cell  lung cancer. METHODS: We did this open-label, randomised phase 3 study at 184 investigative  sites in 26 countries. Patients aged 18 years or older with histologically or  cytologically confirmed stage IV squamous non-small-cell lung cancer, with an  Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group (ECOG) performance status of 0-2 and adequate  organ function and who had not received previous chemotherapy for their disease  were eligible for inclusion. Enrolled patients were randomly assigned centrally  1:1 to a maximum of six 3-week cycles of gemcitabine and cisplastin chemotherapy  with or without necitumumab according to a block randomisation scheme (block  size of four) by a telephone-based interactive voice response system or  interactive web response system. Chemotherapy was gemcitabine 1250 mg/m(2)  administered intravenously over 30 min on days 1 and 8 of a 3-week cycle and  cisplatin 75 mg/m(2) administered intravenously over 120 min on day 1 of a  3-week cycle. Necitumumab 800 mg, administered intravenously over a minimum of  50 min on days 1 and 8, was continued after the end of chemotherapy until  disease progression or intolerable toxic side-effects occurred. Randomisation  was stratified by ECOG performance status and geographical region. Neither  physicians nor patients were masked to group assignment because of the expected  occurrence of acne-like rash--a class effect of EGFR antibodies--that would have  unmasked most patients and investigators to treatment. The primary endpoint was  overall survival, analysed by intention to treat. We report the final clinical  analysis. This study is registered with ClinicalTrials.gov, number NCT00981058. FINDINGS: Between Jan 7, 2010, and Feb 22, 2012, we enrolled 1093 patients and  randomly assigned them to receive necitumumab plus gemcitabine and cisplatin  (n=545) or gemcitabine and cisplatin (n=548). Overall survival was significantly  longer in the necitumumab plus gemcitabine and cisplatin group than in the  gemcitabine and cisplatin alone group (median 11·5 months [95% CI 10·4-12·6]) vs  9·9 months [8·9-11·1]; stratified hazard ratio 0·84 [95% CI 0·74-0·96; p=0·01]).  In the necitumumab plus gemcitabine and cisplatin group, the number of patients  with at least one grade 3 or worse adverse event was higher (388 [72%] of 538  patients) than in the gemcitabine and cisplatin group (333 [62%] of 541), as was  the incidence of serious adverse events (257 [48%] of 538 patients vs 203 [38%]  of 541). More patients in the necitumumab plus gemcitabine and cisplatin group  had grade 3-4 hypomagnesaemia (47 [9%] of 538 patients in the necitumumab plus  gemcitabine and cisplatin group vs six [1%] of 541 in the gemcitabine and  cisplatin group) and grade 3 rash (20 [4%] vs one [<1%]). Including events  related to disease progression, adverse events with an outcome of death were  reported for 66 (12%) of 538 patients in the necitumumab plus gemcitabine and  cisplatin group and 57 (11%) of 541 patients in the gemcitabine and cisplatin  group; these were deemed to be related to study drugs in 15 (3%) and ten (2%)  patients, respectively. Overall, we found that the safety profile of necitumumab  plus gemcitabine and cisplatin was acceptable and in line with expectations. INTERPRETATION: Our findings show that the addition of necitumumab to  gemcitabine and cisplatin chemotherapy improves overall survival in patients  with advanced squamous non-small-cell lung cancer and represents a new  first-line treatment option for this disease.

163,Which diseases can be treated with Afamelanotide?,"['Erythropoietic protoporphyria (EPP) is a rare hereditary disorder characterized  by dermal accumulation of the photosensitizer protoporphyrin IX. Following  sunlight exposure, the resulting photosensitivity is manifested first as pain,  later as erythema, edema and dermal lesions. Afamelanotide  (Nle(4)-D-Phe(7)-alpha-MSH), a synthetic analog of alpha-melanocyte stimulating  hormone and agonist of the melanocortin-1-receptor, promotes melanin synthesis,  increasing skin pigmentation. This study examines the efficacy of afamelanotide  in preventing symptoms in patients with EPP. A sustained-release subcutaneous  implant of 20 mg afamelanotide was administered twice, with a 60-day interval to  five EPP patients. Therapeutic efficacy was assessed by a photoprovocation test  using standardized white light irradiation, melanin density (MD) determination  and daily recording of sunlight exposure and symptoms. From Day 30 to Day 120  tolerance to photoprovocation significantly increased compared with baseline (P  = 0.007) and skin MD was significantly higher than that recorded at baseline (P  = 0.004). Except for two low-grade pain episodes, patients recorded no  phototoxic events past Day 4 of treatment. Tolerance to natural sunlight was up  to 24 times longer than prior to therapy. The findings demonstrate beneficial  effects of afamelanotide in patients with EPP. Due to the limited number of  patients enrolled and the design being an open-label study, confirmation by a  large-scale trial is required.', 'The application of afamelanotide, an α-melanocyte stimulating hormone agonistic  analogue to protoporphyria, a disease with absolute sunlight-intolerance is  discussed. The clinics, genetics and existing therapies of protoporphyria are  described. The physiological receptor-mediated intracellular signaling of  α-melanocyte stimulating hormone and effects of receptor variants are outlined.  The pharmacological action of afamelanotide and the rationale behind its  application in protoporphyria are given. The results of several Phase II and III  and safety issues are discussed. The trial results were significant, although  the effects were not very large in absolute terms, and the risk-safety profile  is favorable today. Based on the high compliance rate and the excellent  consistency in clinical effectiveness during six years of compassionate use  program in Switzerland, we expect afamelanotide and analogues to become a  prospective therapeutic tool. Moreover, we hope that dosage forms suitable for  children will be developed in future, as children and adolescents suffer most in  protoporphyria.', ""Afamelanotide ([Nle4-D-Phe7]-alpha-MSH) is an analog of alpha-melanocyte  stimulating hormone given as a subcutaneous injection.

This  peptide drug, repeatedly administered over prolonged time, may induce anti-drug  antibodies (ADA). Here, we describe a new ELISA method developed to monitor the  occurrence of ADA against afamelanotide as well as against α-MSH. Covalent  binding instead of absorption of antigen onto the microtitre wells prevented  antigen leakage and enabled extensive washings followed by lower background. The  cut-off between antibody-negative and -positive sera was determined. Inhibition  of the antigen-antibody reaction by excess soluble antigen tested for  specificity. The sensitivity of the ELISA was 608 and 1,390 ng/ml of specific  ADA against afamelanotide and α-MSH, respectively. This ELISA method enabled us  to investigate the occurrence of ADA during long-term administration of  afamelanotide. No immunoreactivity was found in 23 of the 26 EPP patients  exposed to the drug for up to 6 years. Pre-existing immunoreactivity against  afamelanotide as well as α-MSH was found in 3 patients, whose titres did not  change during afamelanotide administration. CONCLUSION: The new ELISA is suitable to determine ADA against afamelanotide and  α-MSH. Afamelanotide did not elicit ADA during long-term administration in  patients with EPP.', 'IMPORTANCE OF THE FIELD: Afamelanotide, an α-melanocyte stimulating hormone  (MSH) agonistic analog is a first-in-class therapeutic.

Migalastat, a pharmacological  chaperone, binds to specific mutant forms of α-galactosidase A to restore  lysosomal activity. METHODS: A pharmacogenetic assay was used to identify the α-galactosidase A  mutant forms amenable to migalastat. Six hundred Fabry disease-causing mutations  were expressed in HEK-293 (HEK) cells; increases in α-galactosidase A activity  were measured by a good laboratory practice (GLP)-validated assay (GLP  HEK/Migalastat Amenability Assay). The predictive value of the assay was  assessed based on pharmacodynamic responses to migalastat in phase II and III  clinical studies. RESULTS: Comparison of the GLP HEK assay results in in vivo white blood cell  α-galactosidase A responses to migalastat in male patients showed high  sensitivity, specificity, and positive and negative predictive values (≥0.875).  GLP HEK assay results were also predictive of decreases in kidney  globotriaosylceramide in males and plasma globotriaosylsphingosine in males and  females. The clinical study subset of amenable mutations (n = 51) was  representative of all 268 amenable mutations identified by the GLP HEK assay. CONCLUSION: The GLP HEK assay is a clinically validated method of identifying  male and female Fabry patients for treatment with migalastat.Genet Med 19 4,  430-438.', ""BACKGROUND: Fabry's disease, an X-linked disorder of lysosomal α-galactosidase  deficiency, leads to substrate accumulation in multiple organs. Migalastat, an  oral pharmacologic chaperone, stabilizes specific mutant forms of  α-galactosidase, increasing enzyme trafficking to lysosomes. METHODS: The initial assay of mutant α-galactosidase forms that we used to  categorize 67 patients with Fabry's disease for randomization to 6 months of  double-blind migalastat or placebo (stage 1), followed by open-label migalastat  from 6 to 12 months (stage 2) plus an additional year, had certain limitations.  Before unblinding, a new, validated assay showed that 50 of the 67 participants  had mutant α-galactosidase forms suitable for targeting by migalastat. The  primary end point was the percentage of patients who had a response (≥50%  reduction in the number of globotriaosylceramide inclusions per kidney  interstitial capillary) at 6 months. We assessed safety along with disease  substrates and renal, cardiovascular, and patient-reported outcomes. RESULTS: The primary end-point analysis, involving patients with mutant  α-galactosidase forms that were suitable or not suitable for migalastat therapy,  did not show a significant treatment effect: 13 of 32 patients (41%) who  received migalastat and 9 of 32 patients (28%) who received placebo had a  response at 6 months (P=0.30). Among patients with suitable mutant  α-galactosidase who received migalastat for up to 24 months, the annualized  changes from baseline in the estimated glomerular filtration rate (GFR) and  measured GFR were -0.30±0.66 and -1.51±1.33 ml per minute per 1.73 m(2) of  body-surface area, respectively. The left-ventricular-mass index decreased  significantly from baseline (-7.7 g per square meter; 95% confidence interval  [CI], -15.4 to -0.01), particularly when left ventricular hypertrophy was  present (-18.6 g per square meter; 95% CI, -38.2 to 1.0). The severity of  diarrhea, reflux, and indigestion decreased. CONCLUSIONS: Among all randomly assigned patients (with mutant α-galactosidase  forms that were suitable or not suitable for migalastat therapy), the percentage  of patients who had a response at 6 months did not differ significantly between  the migalastat group and the placebo group.

Tacrine, the first  drug marketed for Alzheimer's disease (AD), induces an elevation of serum liver  transaminase prohibiting an effective dosage in many patients. This 12-week  randomised, double-blind, placebo-controlled study was undertaken to evaluate  the ability of silymarin to antagonise or prevent the hepatotoxic effects of  tacrine and to analyse its action on tacrine efficacy and tolerability. METHODS: Outpatients suffering from mild-to-moderate dementia of the Alzheimer  type were randomly assigned to two treatment groups: tacrine + silymarin and  tacrine + placebo. The study was double-blind for silymarin and open for tacrine  and was conducted in 22 French neurology and geriatric centres. Silymarin (420  mg/day) was given first (1 week) and tacrine was added at 40 mg/day for 6 weeks,  then increased to 80 mg/day (6 weeks). Serum ALAT was the main evaluation  criterion (> upper limit of normal, ULN). Serum ASAT as well as adverse side  effects and cognitive performance assessed by MMSE and the Syndrome Kurtz test  (SKT) were secondary evaluation criteria. Null hypotheses were evaluated with  Fisher's exact test. FINDINGS: 222 patients were recruited and received silymarin and tacrine (110  patients) or placebo and tacrine (112 patients). 28 patients dropped out; 217  were included in the intent-to-treat analysis. No statistical difference was  observed between the two groups for serum ALAT (p = 0.39). Fewer patients had  ALAT levels >5 ULN in the silymarin group (-33.3%). Side effects and notably  gastrointestinal disorders were much less frequent in the silymarin group.  Cognitive performance remained unchanged in both groups. INTERPRETATION: Silymarin does not prevent tacrine-induced ALAT elevation but  does reduce the rate of gastrointestinal and cholinergic side effects without  any impact on cognitive status. As a consequence, silymarin (420 mg/day) could  be co-administered with tacrine to improve tolerability in the initial phases of  AD treatment."", 'Rigel Pharmaceuticals Inc is developing fostamatinib, a prodrug of the spleen  tyrosine kinase (Syk) inhibitor R-406, for the potential treatment of autoimmune  diseases such as rheumatoid arthritis (RA), idiopathic thrombocytopenic purpura  (ITP) and B-cell lymphomas. Syk is a key mediator of Fc and B-cell receptor  signaling in inflammatory cells, such as B-cells, mast cells, macrophages and  neutrophils. Preclinical studies of R-406 or fostamatinib demonstrated a  significant reduction in major inflammatory mediators such as TNFalpha, IL-1,  IL-6 and IL-18, leading to reduced inflammation and bone degradation in models  of RA. In a phase II clinical trial, fostamatinib treatment effectively improved  American College of Rheumatology response rates in patients with RA. Preclinical  studies and phase II trials also suggested the potential of using fostamatinib  for the treatment of ITP and B-cell lymphomas, by increasing platelet counts and  inducing response rates, respectively. Fostamatinib is orally bioavailable and  was well tolerated in phase I and II trials, with the most common side effect  being gastrointestinal symptoms. At the time of publication, phase II trials for  fostamatinib were ongoing in patients with RA, ITP and B-cell lymphomas.

164,What class of drugs have been given a black box warning for suicide?,"['The risk of suicidal behavior associated with antidepressant treatment is an  issue of debate and concern. The US FDA has required that antidepressants carry  a black box warning that there may be a risk of suicidal ideations in depressed  pediatric patients treated with these medications, and recently extended the  warning to include individuals up age 24. However studies of  antidepressant-induced suicidality in adults have yielded contradictory findings  and conclusions. This article discusses investigations of this poorly understood  phenomenon and the clinical implications of research findings and FDA warnings  for clinicians treating adults with depression. Although antidepressant-induced  suicidality apparently occurs only rarely, close monitoring and follow up care  after the initiation of a new antidepressant is indicated.', 'The decision made in the year 2004 by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration  (FDA) to require a boxed warning on antidepressants regarding the risk of  suicidality in young adults still represents a matter of controversy. The FDA  warning was grounded on industry-sponsored trials carried one decade ago or  earlier. However, within the past decade, an increasing number of reports have  questioned the actual validity of the FDA warning, especially considering a  decline in the prescription of the antidepressant drugs associated with an  increase in the rate of suicidal events among people with severe depression. The  present report provides an overview of the FDA black box warning, also  documenting two Major Depressive Disorder patients whose refusal to undergo a  pharmacological antidepressant treatment possibly led to an increased risk for  suicidal behaviors. The concerns raised by the FDA black box warning need to be  considered in real-world clinical practice, stating the associated clinical and  public health implications.', 'Depending on symptom severity, psychopharmacological treatment can be a valuable  option in the treatment of depressive disorders in childhood and adolescence.  This review provides recommendations for clinical treatment, focusing on  suicidality and treatment-resistant patients. The quality of studies regarding  the psychopharmacological therapy of depressive disorders in childhood and  adolescence has improved since the «black box» warning of the FDA concerning the  occurrence of suicidality under treatment with selective serotonin reuptake  inhibitors (SSRIs). In Germany, there is proof for a trend toward a more  evidence-based psychopharmacological treatment approach within recent years.', 'Depression represents a huge pharmaceutical market opportunity. There are  approximately 350 million people worldwide with depression, and it is the  leading cause of disability in the world. In the U.S., 9.1% of the population  suffers from depression. Globally, fewer than half of depression sufferers  receive treatment for their illness, and in some countries this figure falls to  fewer than 1 in 10. The high incidence rate, combined with limited market  penetration, makes depression a high potential market for pharmaceuticals.  However, companies developing drugs for depression also face a number of serious  challenges. Psychosocial treatment options remain the preferred first-line  therapy ahead of medication-and when it comes to drug treatment, the abundance  of generic options available has significantly contributed to halving the value  of the branded antidepressant market over recent years. Another hurdle faced by  new drugs is the requirement that all antidepressants carry a black-box warning  regarding the increased risk of suicide in children, adolescents and young  adults, which limits their use in this population. Switching between medications  presents both an opportunity and a challenge, as a significant number of  patients will switch away from their first medication within the first year of  treatment. The lack of complete understanding of why depression occurs also  makes this area a difficult one, although it opens the door for the development  of drugs with novel mechanisms of action.', ""The United States Food and Drug Administration issued a Black Box warning in  October 2004 after placebo-controlled trials of antidepressant medications found  an increased risk of suicidal thoughts and behaviors among children and  adolescents taking antidepressant medications relative to placebo. Subsequently,  some researchers have concluded that the Black Box warning caused severe  unintended consequences; specifically, they have argued that the warning led to  reduced use of antidepressants among youth, which led to more suicides. In this  paper, we critically examine research regarding the Black Box warning's alleged  deleterious consequences. One study claimed that controlled trials did not  actually find an increased risk of suicidality among youth taking fluoxetine  relative to those taking placebo, but its measure of suicidality is likely  invalid. We found that ecological time series studies claiming that decreasing  antidepressant prescriptions are linked to higher rates of suicide attempts or  actual suicides among youth were methodologically weak. These studies exhibited  shortcomings including: selective use of time points, use of only a short-term  time series, lack of performing statistical analysis, not examining level of  severity/impairment among participants, inability to control confounding  variables, and/or use of questionable measures of suicide attempts. Further,  while some time-series studies claim that increased antidepressant prescriptions  are related to fewer youth suicides, more recent data suggests that increasing  antidepressant prescriptions are related to more youth suicide attempts and more  completed suicides among American children and adolescents. We also note that  case-control studies show increased risk of suicide attempts and suicide among  youth taking antidepressants, even after controlling for some relevant  confounds. As clinical trials have the greatest ability to control relevant  confounds, it is important to remember such trials demonstrated increased risk  of suicidality adverse events among youth taking antidepressants. The Black Box  warning is firmly rooted in solid data whereas attempts to claim the warning has  caused harm are based on quite weak evidence."", 'Depending on symptom severity, psychopharmacological treatment can be a valuable  option in the treatment of depressive disorders in childhood and adolescence.

Dispensing data on  drug combinations involving selective serotonin reuptake inhibitor (SSRI)  antidepressants could help to identify areas for intensified medical education. METHODS: This was a retrospective, cross-sectional analysis of individual  dispensing data regarding all individuals > or =15 years old in Sweden. The  study analysed the prescribing and dispensing of CYP2D6 drugs (metoprolol,  donepezil, galantamine, codeine, tamoxifen) together with CYP2D6-blocking SSRIs  (paroxetine/fluoxetine) or SSRIs without significant CYP2D6 inhibition  (citalopram/escitalopram/sertraline), and the related prescribing of  CYP2D6-independent comparator drugs (atenolol, rivastigmine, propoxyphene,  anastrozole). Odds were calculated between each CYP2D6 drug and the  corresponding comparator drug in patients on fluoxetine/paroxetine and  citalopram/escitalopram/sertraline, respectively. The odds ratio (OR) was  calculated by dividing the obtained odds in patients on fluoxetine/paroxetine by  the corresponding odds in patients on citalopram/escitalopram/sertraline. RESULTS: Compared with patients that were dispensed  citalopram/escitalopram/sertraline, patients dispensed fluoxetine/paroxetine had  lower prescribing rates of metoprolol (adjusted OR 0.80; 95% confidence interval  0.76, 0.85), donepezil (0.65; 0.49, 0.86) and galantamine (0.58; 0.41, 0.81). In  contrast, the use of prodrugs codeine (compared woth propoxyphene) or tamoxifen  (compared with anastrozole) was similar among patients on fluoxetine/paroxetine  and citalopram/escitalopram/sertraline (adjusted OR 1.03; 0.94, 1.12 and 1.29;  0.96, 1.73, respectively).

Selective  serotonin reuptake inhibitors were associated with the highest adjusted hazard  ratios for falls (1.66, 95% confidence interval 1.58 to 1.73) and hyponatraemia  (1.52, 1.33 to 1.75) compared with when antidepressants were not being used. The  group of other antidepressants was associated with the highest adjusted hazard  ratios for all cause mortality (1.66, 1.56 to 1.77), attempted suicide/self harm  (5.16, 3.90 to 6.83), stroke/transient ischaemic attack (1.37, 1.22 to 1.55),  fracture (1.64, 1.46 to 1.84), and epilepsy/seizures (2.24, 1.60 to 3.15),  compared with when antidepressants were not being used. Tricyclic  antidepressants did not have the highest hazard ratio for any of the outcomes.  Significantly different associations also existed between the individual drugs  for the same seven outcomes; trazodone (tricyclic antidepressant), mirtazapine,  and venlafaxine (both in the group of other antidepressants) were associated  with the highest rates for some of these outcomes. Absolute risks over 1 year  for all cause mortality were 7.04% for patients while not taking  antidepressants, 8.12% for those taking tricyclic antidepressants, 10.61% for  selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors, and 11.43% for other antidepressants. CONCLUSIONS: Selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors and drugs in the group of  other antidepressants were associated with an increased risk of several adverse  outcomes compared with tricyclic antidepressants. Among individual drugs,  trazodone, mirtazapine, and venlafaxine were associated with the highest risks  for some outcomes. As this is an observational study, it is susceptible to  confounding by indication, channelling bias, and residual confounding, so  differences in characteristics between patients prescribed different  antidepressant drugs that could account for some of the associations between the  drugs and the adverse outcomes may remain. Further research is needed to confirm  these findings, but the risks and benefits of different antidepressants should  be carefully evaluated when these drugs are prescribed to older people.', ""OBJECTIVE: Isotretinoin (13-cis-retinoic acid), approved by the US Food and Drug  Administration for the treatment of acne, carries a black box warning related to  the risk of depression, suicide, and psychosis. Retinoic acid, the active form  of vitamin A, regulates gene expression in the brain, and isotretinoin is its  13-cis isomer. Retinoids represent a group of compounds derived from vitamin A  that perform a large variety of functions in many systems, in particular the  central nervous system, and abnormal retinoid levels can have neurologic  effects. Although infrequent, proper recognition and treatment of psychiatric  side effects in acne patients is critical given the risk of death and  disability. This article reviews the evidence for isotretinoin's relationships  with depression and suicidality. DATA SOURCES: The PsycINFO, MEDLINE, and PubMed searchable database indexes were  searched for articles published in the English language from 1960 to June 2010  using the key words isotretinoin, retinoids, retinoic acid, depression,  depressive disorders, and vitamin A. Evidence examined includes (1) case  reports; (2) temporal association between onset of depression and exposure to  the drug; (3) challenge-rechallenge cases; (4) class effect (other compounds in  the same class, like vitamin A, having similar neuropsychiatric effects); (5)  dose response; and (6) biologically plausible mechanisms. STUDY SELECTION: All articles in the literature related to isotretinoin,  depression, and suicide were reviewed, as well as articles related to class  effect, dose response, and biologic plausibility. DATA EXTRACTION: Information from individual articles in the literature was  extracted, including number of episodes of depression, suicidality, suicide,  psychosis, violence and aggression, past psychiatric history, time of onset in  relation to isotretinoin usage, medication dosage, duration of treatment, and  dechallenge and challenge history. RESULTS: The literature reviewed is consistent with associations of isotretinoin  administration with depression and with suicide in a subgroup of vulnerable  individuals. CONCLUSIONS: The relationship between isotretinoin and depression may have  implications for a greater understanding of the neurobiology of affective  disorders."", ""Flumazenil, a specific benzodiazepine antagonist, was evaluated as adjunctive  therapy in the management of benzodiazepine overdose. Thirteen emergency  departments enrolled 326 patients in this double-blind, placebo-controlled  trial; 162 patients were randomly allocated to receive flumazenil (maximum dose,  30 ml, providing 3 mg of flumazenil), and 164 were allocated to receive placebo  (maximum dose, 30 ml). A successful response was the attainment of a score of 1  or 2 on the Clinical Global Impression Scale (CGIS), denoting a very much  improved or much improved status, 10 minutes after the start of intravenous  administration of the test drug. Among those patients whose drug screen revealed  the presence of benzodiazepines, 75 (77%) of 97 patients given flumazenil and 13  (16%) of 83 given placebo attained such a response. The mean CGIS score at 10  minutes for benzodiazepine-positive patients treated with flumazenil was 1.95  versus 3.58 for those given placebo. As determined by the Neurobehavioral  Assessment Scale, 61% of patients who initially responded became resedated; in  these patients, the effect of flumazenil lasted a median of 90 minutes. At the  investigator's discretion, patients who did not achieve a criterion response in  the double-blind trial could receive open-label flumazenil, titrated as in the  double-blind phase. Among the benzodiazepine-positive patients, 9 (53%) of 17  patients from the flumazenil group responded to the additional flumazenil, and  58 (81%) of patients previously given placebo responded. Safety was assessed in  all 326 patients given the test drug. The most frequent adverse experiences  after the administration of flumazenil were agitation (7%), vomiting (7%),  abnormal crying (4%), and nausea (4%); these effects were observed with a lower  frequency in the placebo group. Serious adverse experiences were reported in 4  patients; these included seizures and cardiac arrhythmias. Of the 3 patients  with seizures, 2 had ingested large doses of cyclic antidepressants in addition  to the benzodiazepine. The toxicology screen for 1 of the 2 showed 1900 ng/ml of  amoxapine and 900 ng/ml of nortriptyline; the toxicology screen for the other,  who also had ventricular tachycardia, showed 1928 ng/ml of loxapine and 301  ng/ml of amoxapine. The results of this study confirm published reports of the  efficacy of flumazenil in reversing benzodiazepine-induced sedation in patients  with benzodiazepine overdose. This was accomplished irrespective of the presence  of coingested drugs. Flumazenil is not recommended for patients with serious  cyclic antidepressant poisoning or those who use benzodiazepines therapeutically  to control seizure disorders. When used as recommended, however, flumazenil has  been shown to have an acceptable safety level.""]","In 2004, the European and American authorities released a black-box warning on antidepressants indicating an association with an increased risk of suicidality (suicidal ideation and behavior) in young people"
165,Is it possible to detect survivin protein expression in normal human adult tissues?,"['Survivin (BIRC5) is one of the members of IAP-family apoptosis inhibitors. The  BIRCS gene is expressed in most human embryonic tissues and malignant tumors but  not in normal differentiated tissues of adult human. It was suggested that BIRC5  proteins inhibit apoptosis and play an essential role in tumorigenesis, makings  surviving an attractive target for anticancer therapy. The mechanisms regulating  level of survivin are not completely understood. It was supposed that natural  inhibitors of survivin, namely SMAC and PML, play an important role in these  processes. Using RT-PCR and immunoblotting we analyzed the transcription level  of BIRC5, SMAC and PML genes and content of corresponding proteins in normal and  tumor human tissues in non-small cell lung cancer and esophageal squamous cell  carcinoma. It was demonstrated that BIRC5 is transcribed only in tumor tissues,  whereas expression levels of SMAC and PML are the same in normal and tumor  tissues. The contents of proteins correspond to levels of mRNA of the respective  genes. Thus the increase of level of survivin in tumor tissues is not the result  of decrease in content of its inhibitors SMAC and PML, as their content in tumor  and normal cells is the same.', 'Fragile histidine triad (FHIT) gene, a candidate tumor suppressor gene located  at 3p14.2, has been shown to be involved in carcinogenesis of many human  tissues, including digestive tract tissues. However, the expression and role of  FHIT in the initiation and the development of the colorectal cancer (CRC) are  poorly understood. In our present study, we have demonstrated that the FHIT gene  exhibits significantly decreased expression in human CRC compared to colorectal  adenoma and normal colorectal tissue by tissue microarray (TMA). The positive of  FHIT gene expression in normal colorectal tissue, adenoma and adenocarcinoma  were 93.75%, 68.75% and 46.25%, respectively. We showed that decreased FHIT  expression was significantly correlated with the progression of colorectal  carcinoma (P<0.05) as well as differentiation and lymph node metastasis  (P<0.05). Two somatic mutations in the FHIT gene were also detected in human  CRC. The presence of these mutations correlated significantly with decreased  FHIT expression in the human CRC. In addition, we identified decreased FHIT  expression resulting in apoptosis inhibition and decreasing apoptosis associated  with abnormal levels of some pro- and anti-apoptotic proteins (Bax, Bcl-2 and  Survivin) by TUNEL and TMA. Our results demonstrated that the mutation in the  FHIT gene significantly reduced FHIT expression in human CRC. Both TUNEL and TMA  experiments demonstrated significantly inhibited apoptosis by down-regulation of  Bax and up-regulation of Survivin and Bcl-2. Collectively, these studies  identify the mechanism by which an important tumor suppressor gene, FHIT,  inactivated specifically in human CRC, and contributes to our understanding of  the mechanism of colorectal carcinogenesis.', 'A cardinal feature of malignant melanoma is its metastatic propensity. An  incomplete view of the genetic events driving metastatic progression has been a  major barrier to rational development of effective therapeutics and prognostic  diagnostics for melanoma patients. In this study, we conducted global genomic  characterization of primary and metastatic melanomas to examine the genomic  landscape associated with metastatic progression. In addition to uncovering  three genomic subclasses of metastastic melanomas, we delineated 39 focal and  recurrent regions of amplification and deletions, many of which encompassed  resident genes that have not been implicated in cancer or metastasis. To  identify progression-associated metastasis gene candidates, we applied a  statistical approach, Integrative Genome Comparison (IGC), to define 32 genomic  regions of interest that were significantly altered in metastatic relative to  primary melanomas, encompassing 30 resident genes with statistically significant  expression deregulation. Functional assays on a subset of these candidates,  including MET, ASPM, AKAP9, IMP3, PRKCA, RPA3, and SCAP2, validated their  pro-invasion activities in human melanoma cells. Validity of the IGC approach  was further reinforced by tissue microarray analysis of Survivin showing  significant increased protein expression in thick versus thin primary cutaneous  melanomas, and a progression correlation with lymph node metastases. Together,  these functional validation results and correlative analysis of human tissues  support the thesis that integrated genomic and pathological analyses of staged  melanomas provide a productive entry point for discovery of melanoma metastases  genes.', 'Polycomb group proteins are essential regulators of stem cell function during  embryonic development and in adult tissue homeostasis. Bmi1, a key component of  the Polycomb Repressive Complex 1, is highly expressed in undifferentiated  neural stem cells (NSC) as well as in several human cancers including high-grade  gliomas--highly aggressive brain tumors. Using a conditional gene activation  approach in mice, we show that overexpression of Bmi1 induces repressive  epigenetic regulation of the promoter of Survivin, a well-characterized  antiapoptotic protein. This phenomenon is cell type-specific and it leads to  apoptotic death of progenitor cells exclusively upon commitment toward a  neuronal fate. Moreover, we show that this is triggered by increased oxidative  stress-induced DNA damage. In contrast, undifferentiated NSC as well as  glioma-initiating cells display an open chromatin configuration at the Survivin  promoter and do not undergo apoptotic death. These findings raise the  possibility that normal and neoplastic stem cells depend on the same mechanism  for surviving the hyperproliferative state induced by increased Bmi1 expression.', ""We studied the effects of AZD1152, an Aurora B kinase inhibitor, on Burkitt's  lymphoma (BL) and Hodgkin's lymphoma (HL) in human tissues and cell cultures and  in a murine xenograft model of lymphoma. Aurora kinase A and B levels were  assessed by RT-PCR and immunohistochemistry. They were aberrantly expressed in  BL and HL cell lines, and in lymph nodes from patients with BL and HL. Next,  activation of the Aurora B promoter was detected by reporter gene assays. The  promoter activity of Aurora B kinase was high in BL cell lines and the Aurora B  promoter contained a positive regulatory region between -74 and -104 from the  transcription initiation site. AZD1152-hQPA had antiproliferative effects in the  BL and HL cell lines studied; inhibited the phosphorylation of histone H3 and  retinoblastoma proteins, and resulted in cells with > 4N DNA content.  AZD1152-hQPA induced caspase-dependent apoptosis of some cell lines,  demonstrated by loss of mitochondrial membrane potential, activation of  caspase-9, followed by activation of caspase-3. This effect was accompanied by  the inhibition of survivin expression. In vivo efficacy was determined in  NOD/SCID/γc(null) mice implanted with the Ramos human BL cell line. AZD1152 had  anti-tumour effects in this murine xenograft model. There preclinical data  suggest that the inhibition of Aurora B kinase is a potentially useful  therapeutic strategy in BL and HL."", ""Survivin is a member of the inhibitor apoptosis family that is overexpressed in  many malignancies. It has five known alternative splice forms, some of which  differ in their antiapoptotic properties and expression levels in human cancers.  Here we describe a novel donor splice site (DSS), 2B+32 DSS, which is used in  conjunction with survivin alternative exon 2B, resulting in the inclusion of 32  additional nucleotides from intron 2 at the 3' end of this exon. Sequence  analysis showed that both the classical exon 2B DSS and 2B+32 are provided by an  Alu sequence, which is inserted in intron 2 downstream of a functional acceptor  splice site, leading to the exonization of part of the repetitive element. Minor  transcripts including the 2B+32 alternative exon, or retaining the whole  intronic region comprised between exons 2B and 3, were detected in several human  cell lines and in some human tissues. Survivin 2B+32 containing variants acquire  a premature stop codon (PTC) and may therefore be degraded by the nonsense  mediated decay pathway. The implication of these novel isoforms, as well as  other PTC+ survivin variants, in the overall regulation of survivin expression  is discussed. Sequence analysis of intron 2 which contains the Alu Y element was  performed on different primate species in order to trace its insertion and  exonization during primate evolution."", 'PURPOSE: The purpose of this study was to examine breast tumors and normal  breast tissues for the expression of the glycoprotein lacritin. The mRNA and  protein expression of lacritin has been reported to be restricted to the  lacrimal gland. METHODS: We investigated 37 human primary invasive breast tumors, seven breast  cancer cell lines and 16 normal breast tissues by quantitative real-time PCR for  lacritin expression. RESULTS: We detected lacritin transcripts in 51% (19/37) of the primary invasive  breast tumors, in 71% (5/7) of the breast cancer cell lines, and also in 56%  (9/16) of the normal breast tissues. No lacritin mRNA was detectable in  peripheral blood of healthy individuals. CONCLUSIONS: Here we show by quantitative real-time PCR that lacritin is  expressed in human breast tumors, breast cancer cell lines, and normal breast.  The previously reported restricted expression pattern of lacritin is therefore  incorrect. Lacritin transcripts were not detected in peripheral blood which  makes lacritin a potential candidate as a breast cancer marker gene.', 'We evaluate whether 1,25(OH)(2)D(3) downregulates TP73 variants in colon and  breast carcinomas, the role of survivin in this context, and the significance of  this network in the clinic. Tumor cells were treated/untreated with  1,25(OH)(2)D(3) and transiently transfected with survivin. Levels of survivin  and TP73 variants were evaluated by quantitative RT-PCR and Western blotting. In  75 colon and 60 breast cancer patients, the expressions of survivin and TP73  isoforms were determined. Tumor characteristics were examined in each patient.  Survivin protein levels were also evaluated in a subgroup of patients and cell  lines. Decrease in survivin and TAp73 transcripts and protein and ΔNp73 mRNA was  detected after 1,25(OH)(2)D(3) treatment. Ectopic survivin expression led to an  increase in the TAp73, ΔNp73, ΔEx2p73, and ΔEx2-3p73 transcripts. In cancer  patients, direct correlations were observed between TP73 variants and survivin  levels. 1,25(OH)(2)D(3) negatively regulate survivin and TP73 variants in colon  and breast cancer cells. Positive regulation of TP73 isoforms by survivin may  exist, which reinforces the possibility that the downregulation of TP73 forms by  1,25(OH)(2)D(3) is survivin-dependent.', 'DNA methylation and histone acetylation are major epigenetic modifications in  gene silencing. In our previous research, we found that the methylated  oligonucleotide (SurKex) complementary to a region of promoter of survivin could  induce DNA methylation in a site-specific manner leading to survivin silencing.  Here, we further studied the role of histone acetylation in survivin silencing  and the relationship between histone acetylation and DNA methylation. First we  observed the levels of histone H4 and H4K16 acetylation that were decreased  after SurKex treatment by using the chromatin immunoprecipitation (ChIP) assay.  Next, we investigated the roles of histone acetylation and DNA methylation in  survivin silencing after blockade of histone deacetylation with Trichostatin A  (TSA). We assessed survivin mRNA expression by RT-PCR, measured survivin  promoter methylation by bisulfite sequencing and examined the level of histone  acetylation by the ChIP assay. The results showed that histone deacetylation  blocked by TSA reversed the effects of SurKex on inhibiting the expression of  survivin mRNA, inducing a site-specific methylation on survivin promoter and  decreasing the level of histone acetylation. Finally, we examined the role of  histone acetylation in the expression of DNA methyltransferase 1 (DNMT1) mRNA.  The results showed that histone deacetylation blocked by TSA reversed the  increasing effect of histone deacetylation on the expression of survivin mRNA.  This study suggests that histone deacetylation guides SurKex-induced DNA  methylation in survivin silencing possibly through increasing the expression of  DNMT1 mRNA.', 'An important problem involves isolating subpopulations of cells defined by  protein markers in clinical tissue samples for proteomic studies. We describe a  method termed Immunohistochemical staining, laser capture microdissection (LCM)  and filter-aided sample preparation (FASP)-Assisted Proteomic analysis of Target  cell populations within tissue samples (ILFAPT). The principle of ILFAPT is that  a target cell population expressing a protein of interest can be lit up by  immunohistochemical staining and isolated from tissue sections using LCM for  FASP and proteomic analysis. Using this method, we isolated a small population  of CD90(+) stem-like cells from glioblastoma multiforme tissue sections and  identified 674 high-confidence (false discovery rate < 0.01) proteins from 32 nL  of CD90(+) cells by LC-MS/MS using an Orbitrap Elite mass spectrometer. We  further quantified the relative abundance of proteins identified from equal  volumes of LCM-captured CD90(+) and CD90(-) cells, where 109 differentially  expressed proteins were identified. The major group of these differentially  expressed proteins was relevant to cell adhesion and cellular movement. This  ILFAPT method has demonstrated the ability to provide in-depth proteome analysis  of a very small specific cell population within tissues. It can be broadly  applied to the study of target cell populations within clinical specimens.']",No. Survivin is an inhibitor of apoptosis that is undetectable in normal differentiated tissues of adult human.
166,Does thyroid hormone affect cardiac remodeling?,"['Thyroid hormone (TH), apart from its ""classical"" actions on cardiac  contractility and heart rhythm, appears to regulate various intracellular  signalling pathways related to response to stress and cardiac remodelling. There  is now accumulating experimental and clinical evidence showing a beneficial  effect of TH on limiting myocardial ischaemic injury, preventing/reversing post  infarction cardiac remodelling and improving cardiac hemodynamics. Thyroid  analogs have already been developed and may allow TH use in clinical practice.  However, the efficacy of TH in the treatment of cardiac diseases is now awaiting  to be tested in large clinical trials.', 'Chronic ischemia or pressure overload decreases thyroid hormone (TH) signaling  and activates the fetal gene program in the heart. While these features are of  physiologic importance in the developing heart, their respective roles in the  postnatal heart are debated. Administration of TH can prevent the changes of the  fetal gene program and rebuild the heart after an ""index event"" such as  ischemia. TH affects cardiac remodeling by limiting reperfusion injury, and, at  later states, by inducing distinct changes in cardiac chamber geometry in a  time-dependent manner. Furthermore, administration of TH can convert pathologic  to physiologic hypertrophy. These effects are the result of favorable cellular  remodeling. While preliminary clinical studies provide encouraging results, the  potential and efficacy of TH in the treatment of heart disease still await  evaluation in large clinical trials.', 'Thyroid hormone (TH) is critical in cardiac cell differentiation (regulating  contractile proteins and cell geometry) and this effect could be potentially  exploited therapeutically in reversing the process of de-differentiation which  underlies postischemic cardiac remodeling. Acute myocardial infarction was  induced in male Wistar rats by ligating left coronary artery (AMI, n=8), while  sham operated animals served as control (SHAM, n=8). 13 weeks after AMI, TH was  administered in a group of animals for 4 weeks (AMI-THYR, n=9). TH significantly  increased beta-MHC and decreased alpha-MHC expression in the myocardium. This  response was accompanied by changes in cardiac geometry: sphericity index, (SI,  long to short axis ratio) was found to be 1.95 (SEM, 0.02) in SHAM, 1.51(0.03)  in AMI and 1.64(0.03) in AMI-THYR, p<0.05. As a consequence, cardiac function  was significantly improved: left ventricular ejection fraction (EF%) was 74.5%  (SEM, 2.8) in SHAM vs 29.5% (2.1) in AMI, and 40.0% in AMI-THYR, p<0.05.  Furthermore, +dp/dt and -dp/dt were 4250 (127) and 2278 (55) in SHAM vs  2737(233) and 1508 (95) in AMI vs 3866 (310) and 2137(111) in AMI -THYR,  respectively, p<0.05. TH treatment partially reverses cardiac dysfunction in  rats with old myocardial infarction by favorably changing cardiac chamber  geometry and expression of myosin isoforms. Thyroid hormone, unlike current  treatments, appears to be a paradigm of therapeutic intervention which aims at  restoring cardiac geometry and may prove new effective treatment for heart  failure.', 'Thyroid hormone receptor α1 (TRα1) is shown to be critical for the maturation of  cardiomyocytes and for the cellular response to stress. TRα1 is altered during  post ischemic cardiac remodeling but the physiological significance of this  response is not fully understood. Thus, the present study explored the potential  consequences of selective pharmacological inhibition of TRα1 on the mechanical  performance of the post-infarcted heart. Acute myocardial infarction was induced  in mice (AMI), while sham operated animals served as controls (SHAM). A group of  mice was treated with debutyl-dronedarone (DBD), a selective TRα1 inhibitor  (AMI-DBD). AMI resulted in low T3 levels in plasma and in down-regulation of  TRα1 and TRβ1 expression. Left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF%) was  significantly reduced in AMI [33 (SEM 2.1) vs 79(2.5) in SHAM, p < 0.05] and was  further declined in AMI-DBD [22(1.1) vs 33(2.1), respectively, p < 0.05].  Cardiac mass was increased in AMI but not in AMI-DBD hearts, resulting in  significant increase in wall tension index. This increase in wall stress was  accompanied by marked activation of p38 MAPK, a kinase that is sensitive to  mechanical stretch and exerts negative inotropic effect. Furthermore, AMI  resulted in β-myosin heavy chain overexpression and reduction in the ratio of  SR(Ca)ATPase to phospholamban (PLB). The latter further declined in AMI-DBD  mainly due to increased expression of PLB. AMI induces downregulation of thyroid  hormone signaling and pharmacological inhibition of TRα1 further depresses  post-ischemic cardiac function. p38 MAPK and PLB may, at least in part, be  involved in this response.', 'The present study investigated whether changes in thyroid hormone (TH)  signalling can occur after acute myocardial infarction (AMI) with possible  physiological consequences on myocardial performance. TH may regulate several  genes encoding important structural and regulatory proteins particularly through  the TR alpha 1 receptor which is predominant in the myocardium. AMI was induced  in rats by ligating the left coronary artery while sham-operated animals served  as controls. This resulted in impaired cardiac function in AMI animals after 2  and 13 weeks accompanied by a shift in myosin isoforms expression towards a  fetal phenotype in the non-infarcted area. Cardiac hypertrophy was evident in  AMI hearts after 13 weeks but not at 2 weeks. This response was associated with  a differential pattern of TH changes at 2 and 13 weeks; T(3) and T(4) levels in  plasma were not changed at 2 weeks but T(3) was significantly lower and T(4)  remained unchanged at 13 weeks. A twofold increase in TR alpha 1 expression was  observed after 13 weeks in the non-infarcted area, P<0.05 versus sham operated,  while TR alpha 1 expression remained unchanged at 2 weeks. A 2.2-fold decrease  in TR beta 1 expression was found in the non-infarcted area at 13 weeks, P<0.05,  while no change in TR beta 1 expression was seen at 2 weeks. Parallel studies  with neonatal cardiomyocytes showed that phenylephrine (PE) administration  resulted in 4.5-fold increase in the expression of TR alpha 1 and 1.6-fold  decrease in TR beta 1 expression versus untreated, P<0.05. In conclusion,  cardiac dysfunction which occurs at late stages after AMI is associated with  increased expression of TR alpha 1 receptor and lower circulating  tri-iodothyronine levels. Thus, apo-TR alpha 1 receptor state may prevail  contributing to cardiac fetal phenotype. Furthermore, down-regulation of TR beta  1 also contributes to fetal phenotypic changes. alpha1-adrenergic signalling is,  at least in part, involved in this response.', 'We asked whether thyroid hormone (T4) would improve heart function in left  ventricular hypertrophy (LVH) induced by pressure overload (aortic banding).  After banding for 10-22 wk, rats were treated with T4 or saline for 10-14 d.  Isovolumic LV pressure and cytosolic [Ca2+] (indo-1) were assessed in perfused  hearts. Sarcoplasmic reticulum Ca2+-ATPase (SERCA), phospholamban, and alpha-  and beta-myosin heavy chain (MHC) proteins were assayed in homogenates of  myocytes isolated from the same hearts. Of 14 banded hearts treated with saline,  8 had compensated LVH with normal function (LVHcomp), whereas 6 had abnormal  contraction, relaxation, and calcium handling (LVHdecomp). In contrast, banded  animals treated with T4 had no myocardial dysfunction; these hearts had  increased contractility, and faster relaxation and cytosolic [Ca2+] decline  compared with LVHcomp and LVHdecomp. Myocytes from banded hearts treated with T4  were hypertrophied but had increased concentrations of alpha-MHC and SERCA  proteins, similar to physiological hypertrophy induced by exercise. Thus thyroid  hormone improves LV function and calcium handling in pressure overload  hypertrophy, and these beneficial effects are related to changes in myocyte gene  expression. Induction of physiological hypertrophy by thyroid hormone-like  signaling might be a therapeutic strategy for treating cardiac dysfunction in  pathological hypertrophy and heart failure.', 'OBJECTIVE: Previous experimental studies have provided evidence showing that  changes in thyroid hormone signaling correspond to alterations in myocardial  function in animal models of heart failure. The present study further explores  whether thyroid hormone alterations are correlated with the functional status of  the myocardium in patients with heart failure. METHODS: In this study, 37 patients with mean ejection fraction (EF%) of 26.2  (8.2) were included. Myocardial performance was assessed by echocardiography and  cardiopulmonary exercise testing. Total tri-iodothyronine (T3), thyroxine, and  TSH levels were measured in plasma. RESULTS: Total T3 was strongly correlated with VO2max (r = 0.78, P = 2 x  10(-8)). Furthermore, multivariate analysis revealed that total T3 was an  independent predictor of VO2max (P = 0.000 005). A weaker but significant  correlation was also found between total T3 and EF% (r = 0.56, P = 0.0004),  systolic (r = 0.43, P = 0.009) and diastolic (r = 0.46, P = 0.004) blood  pressure. CONCLUSIONS: changes in thyroid hormone were closely correlated to myocardial  functional status in patients with heart failure. These data probably indicate a  possible role of thyroid hormone in the pathophysiology of heart failure and  confirm previous experimental reports.', 'Changes in thyroid status are associated with profound alterations in  biochemical and physiological functioning of cardiac muscle impacting metabolic  rate, contractility and structural hypertrophy. Using an in vivo model of  chronic treatment with thyroid hormone (T4, 0.3 mg/kg/day), we evaluated how  mitochondria are regulated in response to T4, and assessed the relationship of  T4-induced mitochondrial biogenesis and bioenergetics to overall cardiac  hypertrophy. The role of thyroid hormone in cardiac bioenergetic remodeling was  addressed in rats treated with T4 for 5, 10 and 15 days. Over that time,  myocardial oxygen consumption substantially increased as did cardiac  hypertrophy. Myocardial levels of mitochondrial enzyme activities, mitochondrial  DNA (mtDNA), specific proteins and transcript were assessed. Activity levels of  respiratory complexes I-V and citrate synthase significantly increased with 15  but not with 5 or 10-day T4 treatment. Myocardial levels of mtDNA, mitochondrial  proteins (e.g. cytochrome c, cytochrome b, ATPase subunits, MnSOD) and the  global transcription factor PPARalpha were significantly elevated with 15-day  T4. Transcript analysis revealed increased expression of transcription factors  and cofactors involved in mitochondrial biogenesis including PPARalpha, mtTFA,  ErbAalpha and PGC-1alpha. Our findings indicate parallel increases in myocardial  mitochondrial bioenergetic capacity, oxygen consumption and markers of  mitochondrial biogenesis with 15-day T4; these changes were not present with  10-day T4 even with significant cardiac hypertrophy. The marked, parallel  increases in PPARalpha levels suggest its potential involvement in mediating  myocardial-specific remodeling of mitochondria in response to T4.', 'Similarities in cardiac gene expression in hypothyroidism and left ventricular  (LV) pathological remodeling after myocardial infarction (MI) suggest a role for  impaired cardiac thyroid hormone (TH) signaling in the development of heart  failure. Increased ventricular activity of the TH-degrading enzyme type 3  deiodinase (D3) is recognized as a potential cause. In the present study, we  investigated the cardiac expression and activity of D3 over an 8-wk period after  MI in C57Bl/6J mice. Pathological remodeling of the noninfarcted part of the LV  was evident from cardiomyocyte hypertrophy, interstitial fibrosis, and  impairment of contractility. These changes were maximal and stable from the  first week onward, as was the degree of LV dilation. A strong induction of D3  activity was found, which was similarly stable for the period examined. Plasma  T(4) levels were transiently decreased at 1 wk after MI, but T(3) levels  remained normal. The high D3 activity was associated with increased D3 mRNA  expression at 1 but not at 4 and 8 wk after MI. Immunohistochemistry localized  D3 protein to cardiomyocytes. In vivo measurement of TH-dependent transcription  activity in cardiomyocytes using a luciferase reporter assay indicated a 48%  decrease in post-MI mice relative to sham-operated animals, and this was  associated with a 50% decrease in LV tissue T(3) concentration. In conclusion,  pathological ventricular remodeling after MI in the mouse leads to high and  stable induction of D3 activity in cardiomyocytes and a local hypothyroid  condition.', 'Alterations in TR [thyroid hormone (TH) receptor]1 isoform expression have been  reported in models of both physiologic and pathologic cardiac hypertrophy as  well as in patients with heart failure. In this report, we demonstrate that TH  induces hypertrophy as a direct result of binding to the TRalpha1 isoform and,  moreover, that overexpression of TRalpha1 alone is also associated with a  hypertrophic phenotype, even in the absence of ligand. The mechanism of TH and  TRalpha1-specific hypertrophy is novel for a nuclear hormone receptor and  involves the transforming growth factor beta-activated kinase (TAK1) and p38.  Mitigating TRalpha1 effects, both TRalpha2 and TRbeta1 attenuate  TRalpha1-induced myocardial growth and gene expression by diminishing TAK1 and  p38 activities, respectively. These findings refine our previous observations on  TR expression in the hypertrophied and failing heart and suggest that  manipulation of thyroid hormone signaling in an isoform-specific manner may be a  relevant therapeutic target for altering the pathologic myocardial program.']",TH affects cardiac remodeling
167,Is bortezomib a Proteasome inhibitor?,"['In eukaryotic cells, degradation of most intracellular proteins is carried out  by the ubiquitin-proteasome pathway. Recent investigations suggest that bone  metabolism is also regulated by this pathway. The clinical efficacy of  bortezomib, a 26S proteasome inhibitor used as an anticancer drug, has been  linked to an increase in bone formation. In this study, we show that proteasome  inhibitors induce expression of osteoblastic differentiation-related genes such  as osteocalcin and alkaline phosphatase in C2C12 cells. In contrast, myogenic  differentiation is inhibited. Among the proteasome inhibitors tested, bortezomib  induced the greatest increase in osteocalcin expression. Although these effects  were similar to that of bone morphogenetic protein (BMP) 2, proteasome  inhibitors did not induce transcriptional activity of Smad1/4-dependent reporter  or BMP2 signaling target gene expression. Transient transfection of osteocalcin  promoter-luciferase constructs with bortezomib resulted in an increase in  luciferase activity. Mutation of OSE2, but not OSE1, sites of the osteocalcin  promoter diminished the bortezomib-induced activity. Also, Runx2 binding  activity and protein levels were induced by bortezomib treatment. These results  suggest that the bortezomib induces osteoblastic differentiation by modifying  the activity of Runx2 and that the function of the proteasome in controlling  degradation of differentiation-related transcription factors plays an important  role in osteoblast differentiation.', 'The proteasome inhibitor bortezomib is emerging as a potent anti-cancer agent.  Still, recent clinical trials have revealed a significant secondary toxicity of  bortezomib. Consequently, there is much interest in dissecting the mechanism of  action of this compound to rationally improve its therapeutic index. The  cytotoxic effect of bortezomib is frequently characterized by interfering with  downstream events derived from the accumulation of proteasomal targets. Here we  identify the first chemical agent able to act upstream of the proteasome to  prevent cell killing by bortezomib. Specifically, we show that the polyhydroxyl  compound Tiron can function as a competitive inhibitor of bortezomib. This  effect of Tiron was surprising, since it is a classical radical spin trap and  was expected to scavenge reactive oxygen species produced as a consequence of  bortezomib action. The inhibitory effect of Tiron against bortezomib was  selective, since it was not shared by other antioxidants, such as vitamin E,  MnTBAP, L-N-acetyl-cysteine, and FK-506. Comparative analyses with nonboronated  proteasome inhibitors (i.e. MG132) revealed a specificity of Tiron for  bortezomib. We exploited this novel feature of Tiron to define the ""point of no  return"" of proteasome inhibition in melanoma cells and to block cell death in a  three-dimensional model of human skin. Cells from T-cell lymphoma, breast  carcinoma, and non-small cell lung cancer were also responsive to Tiron,  suggesting a broad impact of this agent as a bortezomib blocker. These results  may have important implications for the analysis of bortezomib in vivo and for  the design of drug mixtures containing proteasome inhibitors.', ""The proteasome inhibitor Bortezomib is used to treat multiple myeloma (MM).  Bortezomib inhibits protein degradation by inactivating proteasomes'  active-sites. MM cells are exquisitely sensitive to Bortezomib - exhibiting a  low-nanomolar IC(50) - suggesting that minimal inhibition of degradation  suffices to kill MM cells. Instead, we report, a low Bortezomib concentration,  contrary to expectation, achieves severe inhibition of proteasome activity in MM  cells: the degree of inhibition exceeds what one would expect from the small  proportion of active-sites that Bortezomib inhibits. Our data indicate that  Bortezomib achieves this severe inhibition by triggering secondary changes in  proteasome structure that further inhibit proteasome activity. Comparing MM  cells to other, Bortezomib-resistant, cancer cells shows that the degree of  proteasome inhibition is the greatest in MM cells and only there leads to  proteasome stress, providing an explanation for why Bortezomib is effective  against MM but not other cancers."", 'Bortezomib (Velcade™) is a reversible proteasome inhibitor that is approved for  the treatment of multiple myeloma (MM). Despite its demonstrated clinical  success, some patients are deprived of treatment due to primary refractoriness  or development of resistance during therapy. To investigate the role of the  duration of proteasome inhibition in the anti-tumor response of bortezomib, we  established clonal isolates of HT-29 adenocarcinoma cells adapted to continuous  exposure of bortezomib. These cells were ~30-fold resistant to bortezomib. Two  novel and distinct mutations in the β5 subunit, Cys63Phe, located distal to the  binding site in a helix critical for drug binding, and Arg24Cys, found in the  propeptide region were found in all resistant clones. The latter mutation is a  natural variant found to be elevated in frequency in patients with MM.  Proteasome activity and levels of both the constitutive and immunoproteasome  were increased in resistant cells, which correlated to an increase in subunit  gene expression. These changes correlated with a more rapid recovery of  proteasome activity following brief exposure to bortezomib. Increased recovery  rate was not due to increased proteasome turnover as similar findings were seen  in cells co-treated with cycloheximide. When we exposed resistant cells to the  irreversible proteasome inhibitor carfilzomib we noted a slower rate of recovery  of proteasome activity as compared to bortezomib in both parental and resistant  cells. Importantly, carfilzomib maintained its cytotoxic potential in the  bortezomib resistant cell lines. Therefore, resistance to bortezomib, can be  overcome with irreversible inhibitors, suggesting prolonged proteasome  inhibition induces a more potent anti-tumor response.', ""OBJECTIVE Glioblastoma (GBM) is the most prevalent and the most aggressive of  primary brain tumors. There is currently no effective treatment for this tumor.  The proteasome inhibitor bortezomib is effective for a variety of tumors, but  not for GBM. The authors' goal was to demonstrate that bortezomib can be  effective in the orthotopic GBM murine model if the appropriate method of drug  delivery is used. In this study the Alzet mini-osmotic pump was used to bring  the drug directly to the tumor in the brain, circumventing the blood-brain  barrier; thus making bortezomib an effective treatment for GBM. METHODS The 2  human glioma cell lines, U87 and U251, were labeled with luciferase and used in  the subcutaneous and intracranial in vivo tumor models. Glioma cells were  implanted subcutaneously into the right flank, or intracranially into the  frontal cortex of athymic nude mice. Mice bearing intracranial glioma tumors  were implanted with an Alzet mini-osmotic pump containing different doses of  bortezomib. The Alzet pumps were introduced directly into the tumor bed in the  brain. Survival was documented for mice with intracranial tumors. RESULTS Glioma  cells were sensitive to bortezomib at nanomolar quantities in vitro. In the  subcutaneous in vivo xenograft tumor model, bortezomib given intravenously was  effective in reducing tumor progression. However, in the intracranial glioma  model, bortezomib given systemically did not affect survival. By sharp contrast,  animals treated with bortezomib intracranially at the tumor site exhibited  significantly increased survival. CONCLUSIONS Bypassing the blood-brain barrier  by using the osmotic pump resulted in an increase in the efficacy of bortezomib  for the treatment of intracranial tumors. Thus, the intratumoral administration  of bortezomib into the cranial cavity is an effective approach for glioma  therapy."", 'The ubiquitin-proteasome pathway is involved in intracellular protein turnover,  and its function is crucial to cellular homeostasis. First synthesized as probes  of proteolytic processes, proteasome inhibitors began to be thought of as  potential drug candidates when they were found to induce programmed cell death  preferentially in transformed cells. They made their first leap into the clinic  to be tested as therapeutic agents 10 years ago, and since then, great strides  have been made in defining their mechanisms of action, their clinical efficacy  and toxicity, and some of their limitations in the form of resistance pathways.  Validation of the ubiquitin-proteasome pathway as a target for cancer therapy  has come in the form of approvals of the first such inhibitor, bortezomib, for  relapsed/refractory multiple myeloma and mantle cell lymphoma, for which this  agent has become a standard of care. Lessons learned from this first-in-class  agent are now being applied to the development of a new generation of proteasome  inhibitors that hold the promise of efficacy in bortezomib-resistant disease and  possibly in a broader spectrum of diseases. This saga provides a salient example  of the promise of translational medicine and a paradigm by which other agents  may be successfully brought from the bench to the bedside.', 'The cancer drug discovery field has placed much emphasis on the identification  of novel and cancer-specific molecular targets. A rich source of such targets  for the design of novel anti-tumor agents is the ubiqutin-proteasome system  (UP-S), a tightly regulated, highly specific pathway responsible for the vast  majority of protein turnover within the cell. Because of its critical role in  almost all cell processes that ensure normal cellular function, its inhibition  at one point in time was deemed non-specific and therefore not worth further  investigation as a molecular drug target. However, today the proteasome is one  of the most promising anti-cancer drug targets of the century. The discovery  that tumor cells are in fact more sensitive to proteasome inhibitors than normal  cells indeed paved the way for the design of its inhibitors. Such efforts have  led to bortezomib, the first FDA approved proteasome inhibitor now used as a  frontline treatment for newly diagnosed multiple myeloma (MM),  relapsed/refractory MM and mantle cell lymphoma. Though successful in improving  clinical outcomes for patients with hematological malignancies, relapse often  occurs in those who initially responded to bortezomib. Therefore, the  acquisition of bortezomib resistance is a major issue with its therapy.  Furthermore, some neuro-toxicities have been associated with bortezomib  treatment and its efficacy in solid tumors is lacking. These observations have  encouraged researchers to pursue the next generation of proteasome inhibitors,  which would ideally overcome bortezomib resistance, have reduced toxicities and  a broader range of anti-cancer activity. This review summarizes the success and  limitations of bortezomib, and describes recent advances in the field,  including, and most notably, the most recent FDA approval of carfilzomib in  July, 2012, a second generation proteasome inhibitor. Other proteasome  inhibitors currently in clinical trials and those that are currently  experimental grade will also be discussed.', 'The ubiquitin-proteasome pathway regulates many basic cellular processes and has  been proven to be a promising target for cancer therapy. Bortezomib is the first  U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) approved proteasome inhibitor used in  the treatment of newly diagnosed multiple myeloma, relapsed/refractory multiple  myeloma, and mantle cell lymphoma. The anti-cancer mechanisms of bortezomib  elucidated by preclinical studies include: upregulation of proapoptotic proteins  (e.g., Noxa, IκB), inhibition of NFκB and its anti-apoptotic target genes,  suppression of several anti-apoptotic proteins (e.g., Bcl-XL, Bcl-2, and  STAT-3), down-regulation of expression of several proteins involved in DNA  repair pathways, and induction of endoplasmic reticulum (ER) stress and  pro-apoptotic Unfolded Protein Response (UPR). Bortezomib has potent  chemo-/radio-sensitizing effects and can overcome traditional drug resistance in  tumors when used in combination with potential chemotherapies. Although  bortezomib has been successful in improving clinical outcomes when used in  hematological malignancies, relapse may occur in those patients who responded  initially. Furthermore, some cytotoxicities (such as peripheral neuropathy) were  found to be associated with bortezomib treatment. These observations have  encouraged researchers to search for the next generation proteasome inhibitors  (including carfilzomib and marizomib) that could overcome bortezomib resistance  and have improved properties, reduced toxicities, and broader anticancer  activities, based on the lessons learned from the mechanisms and use of  bortezomib. This review summarizes the current status of bortezomib as well as  several other proteasome inhibitors that are currently under clinical and  preclinical investigation.', 'A major challenge in cancer therapy is tumor drug resistance. To overcome it, it  is essential to understand the mechanisms and identify the molecules involved,  so that they can be specifically targeted in combination therapies. The  proteasome is such a validated target: it plays a key role in cancer cell  proliferation, inhibition of chemotherapy-induced apoptosis and drug resistance  development. Bortezomib (Velcade, PS-341) was the first proteasome inhibitor to  receive regulatory approval from the US Food and Drug Administration for the  treatment of multiple myeloma. Clinical combination trials have demonstrated a  chemo-sensitizing effect of bortezomib on conventional agents in hematological  malignancies and some solid tumors such as androgen-independent prostate and  ovarian cancer. Although generally well-tolerated, bortezomib still generates  toxicity which underscores the need for less toxic proteasome inhibitors.  Several naturally occurring products, such as green tea polyphenols and the  antibiotic lactacystin, have been shown to be potent proteasome inhibitors.  Significantly, green tea polyphenols, as well as several flavonoids such as  genistein, curcumin and resveratrol, have also been shown to have  chemo-sensitizing properties in prostate, breast, hepatic, and lung tumors.  Further studies on natural proteasome inhibitors as chemo-sensitizers could lead  to identification of more potent and less toxic compounds that could be used in  combination therapies for drug-resistant tumors.', 'Bortezomib (Velcade™) is a reversible proteasome inhibitor that is approved for  the treatment of multiple myeloma (MM).

168,What is the indication for Favipiravir?,"['Background: In addition to supportive therapy, antiviral therapy is an effective  treatment for coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19). Objective: To compare the  efficacy and safety of favipiravir and umifenovir (Arbidol) to treat COVID-19  patients. Methods: We conducted a prospective, randomized, controlled,  open-label multicenter trial involving adult patients with COVID-19. Enrolled  patients with initial symptoms within 12\xa0days were randomly assigned in a 1:1  ratio to receive conventional therapy plus Arbidol (200\xa0mg*3/day) or favipiravir  (1600\xa0mg*2/first day followed by 600\xa0mg*2/day) for 7\xa0days. The primary outcome  was the clinical recovery rate at day 7 of drug administration (relief for  pyrexia and cough, respiratory frequency ≤24 times/min; oxygen saturation ≥98%).  Latency to relief for pyrexia and cough and the rate of auxiliary oxygen therapy  (AOT) or noninvasive mechanical ventilation (NMV)/mechanical ventilation (MV)  were the secondary outcomes. Safety data were collected for 17\xa0days. Results: A  total of 240 enrolled COVID-19 patients underwent randomization; 120 patients  were assigned to receive favipiravir (116 assessed), and 120 patients were  assigned to receive Arbidol (120 assessed). The clinical recovery rate at day 7  of drug administration did not significantly differ between the favipiravir  group (71/116) and Arbidol group (62/120) (p = 0.1396, difference in recovery  rate: 0.0954; 95% CI: -0.0305∼0.2213). Favipiravir contributed to relief for  both pyrexia (difference: 1.70 days, p < 0.0001) and cough (difference: 1.75  days, p < 0.0001). No difference was observed in the AOT or NMV/MV rate (both p  > 0.05). The most frequently observed favipiravir-associated adverse event was  increased serum uric acid (16/116, OR: 5.52, p = 0.0014). Conclusion: Among  patients with COVID-19, favipiravir, compared to Arbidol, did not significantly  improve the clinical recovery rate at day 7. Favipiravir significantly improved  the latency to relieve pyrexia and cough. Adverse effects caused by favipiravir  are mild and manageable.', 'Favipiravir has been developed as an anti-influenza drug and licensed as an  anti-influenza drug in Japan. Additionally, favipiravir is being stockpiled for  2 million people as a countermeasure for novel influenza strains. This drug  functions as a chain terminator at the site of incorporation of the viral RNA  and reduces the viral load. Favipiravir cures all mice in a lethal influenza  infection model, while oseltamivir fails to cure the animals. Thus, favipiravir  contributes to curing animals with lethal infection. In addition to influenza,  favipiravir has a broad spectrum of anti-RNA virus activities in vitro and  efficacies in animal models with lethal RNA viruses and has been used for  treatment of human infection with life-threatening Ebola virus, Lassa virus,  rabies, and severe fever with thrombocytopenia syndrome. The best feature of  favipiravir as an antiviral agent is the apparent lack of generation of  favipiravir-resistant viruses. Favipiravir alone maintains its therapeutic  efficacy from the first to the last patient in an influenza pandemic or an  epidemic lethal RNA virus infection. Favipiravir is expected to be an important  therapeutic agent for severe influenza, the next pandemic influenza strain, and  other severe RNA virus infections for which standard treatments are not  available.', 'Favipiravir (FVP) has been used for treatment of COVID-19 in many countries. We  analysed the incidence of FVP-induced cutaneous adverse reactions (CARs) in  patients infected with COVID-19 who were hospitalized at Bamrasnaradura  Infectious Diseases Institute, a principal centre of emerging infectious disease  in Thailand, and who presented with cutaneous eruption following FVP  prescription. We identified five cases of FVP-induced CARs: two patients with  maculopapular rash, two with urticarial rash, and one with Stevens-Johnson  syndrome. The median interval between FVP treatment and rash occurrence was  7\u2009days and the mean duration of the rash was 5\u2009days. This report highlights that  FVP can induce CARs, particularly eruptions, in COVID-19-infected patients.  Clinicians should be aware of this possible drug-related allergy, and it should  be excluded as a cause of rash during FVP treatment of COVID-19.', ""Favipiravir (T-705; 6-fluoro-3-hydroxy-2-pyrazinecarboxamide) is an antiviral  drug that selectively inhibits the RNA-dependent RNA polymerase of influenza  virus. It is phosphoribosylated by cellular enzymes to its active form,  favipiravir-ribofuranosyl-5'-triphosphate (RTP). Its antiviral effect is  attenuated by the addition of purine nucleic acids, indicating the viral RNA  polymerase mistakenly recognizes favipiravir-RTP as a purine nucleotide.  Favipiravir is active against a broad range of influenza viruses, including  A(H1N1)pdm09, A(H5N1) and the recently emerged A(H7N9) avian virus. It also  inhibits influenza strains resistant to current antiviral drugs, and shows a  synergistic effect in combination with oseltamivir, thereby expanding influenza  treatment options. A Phase III clinical evaluation of favipiravir for influenza  therapy has been completed in Japan and two Phase II studies have been completed  in the United States. In addition to its anti-influenza activity, favipiravir  blocks the replication of many other RNA viruses, including arenaviruses (Junin,  Machupo and Pichinde); phleboviruses (Rift Valley fever, sandfly fever and Punta  Toro); hantaviruses (Maporal, Dobrava, and Prospect Hill); flaviviruses (yellow  fever and West Nile); enteroviruses (polio- and rhinoviruses); an alphavirus,  Western equine encephalitis virus; a paramyxovirus, respiratory syncytial virus;  and noroviruses.

This review provides insights into the evidence-based evolving role of  favipiravir in the management of COVID-19 infection with emphasis on benefits of  initiating an early antiviral therapy with special focus on favipiravir, its  pharmacodynamic, pharmacokinetic, in vitro, clinical data, and inclusion in the  treatment protocols of COVID-19.', 'BACKGROUND: Favipiravir possesses high utility for treating patients with  COVID-19. However, research examining the efficacy and safety of favipiravir for  patients with COVID-19 is limited. METHODS: We conducted a systematic review of published studies reporting the  efficacy of favipiravir against COVID-19. Two investigators independently  searched PubMed, the Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews, MedRxiv, and  ClinicalTrials.gov (inception to September 2020) to identify eligible studies. A  meta-analysis was performed to measure viral clearance and clinical improvement  as the primary outcomes. RESULTS: Among 11 eligible studies, 5 included a comparator group. Comparing to  the comparator group, the favipiravir group exhibited significantly better viral  clearance on day 7 after the initiation of treatment (odds ratio [OR]\u2009=\u20092.49,  95% confidence interval [CI]\u2009=\u20091.19-5.22), whereas no difference was noted on  day 14 (OR\u2009=\u20092.19, 95% CI\u2009=\u20090.69-6.95). Although clinical improvement was  significantly better in the favipiravir group on both days 7 and 14, the  improvement was better on day 14 (OR\u2009=\u20093.03, 95% CI\u2009=\u20091.17-7.80) than on day 7  (OR\u2009=\u20091.60, 95% CI\u2009=\u20091.03-2.49). The estimated proportions of patients with  viral clearance in the favipiravir arm on days 7 and 14 were 65.42 and 88.9%,  respectively, versus 43.42 and 78.79%, respectively, in the comparator group.  The estimated proportions of patients with clinical improvement on days 7 and 14  in the favipiravir group were 54.33 and 84.63%, respectively, compared with  34.40 and 65.77%, respectively, in the comparator group. CONCLUSIONS: Favipiravir induces viral clearance by 7\u2009days and contributes to  clinical improvement within 14\u2009days. The results indicated that favipiravir has  strong possibility for treating COVID-19, especially in patients with  mild-to-moderate illness. Additional well-designed studies, including  examinations of the dose and duration of treatment, are crucial for reaching  definitive conclusions.', 'Despite several clinical trials implemented, no antiviral drug could demonstrate  efficacy against Ebola virus. In non-human primates, early initiation of  polymerase inhibitors favipiravir and remdesivir improves survival, but whether  they could be effective in patients is unknown. Here we analyze the impact of  antiviral therapy by using a mathematical model that integrates virological and  immunological data of 44 cynomolgus macaques, left untreated or treated with  favipiravir. We estimate that favipiravir has a ~50% efficacy in blocking viral  production, which results in reducing virus growth and cytokine storm while IFNα  reduces cell susceptibility to infection. Simulating the effect of delayed  initiations of treatment, our model predicts survival rates of 60% for  favipiravir and 100% for remdesivir when treatment is initiated within 3 and 4  days post infection, respectively. These results improve the understanding of  Ebola immuno-pathogenesis and can help optimize antiviral evaluation in future  outbreaks.', 'OBJECTIVE: The global pandemic called COVID-19 has dragged the world into a  healthcare crisis, and favipiravir is one of the most prescribed agents against  the virus so far.

Conclusion: Among  patients with COVID-19, favipiravir, compared to Arbidol, did not significantly  improve the clinical recovery rate at day 7. Favipiravir significantly improved  the latency to relieve pyrexia and cough. Adverse effects caused by favipiravir  are mild and manageable.']",Favipiravir (FVP) has been used for treatment of COVID-19 in many countries.
169,Does splicing occur co-transcriptionally?,"[""RNA processing events that take place on the transcribed pre-mRNA include  capping, splicing, editing, 3' processing, and polyadenylation. Most of these  processes occur co-transcriptionally while the RNA polymerase II (Pol II) enzyme  is engaged in transcriptional elongation. How Pol II elongation rates are  influenced by splicing is not well understood. We generated a family of  inducible gene constructs containing increasing numbers of introns and exons,  which were stably integrated in human cells to serve as actively transcribing  gene loci. By monitoring the association of the transcription and splicing  machineries on these genes in vivo, we showed that only U1 snRNP localized to  the intronless gene, consistent with a splicing-independent role for U1 snRNP in  transcription. In contrast, all snRNPs accumulated on intron-containing genes,  and increasing the number of introns increased the amount of spliceosome  components recruited. This indicates that nascent RNA can assemble multiple  spliceosomes simultaneously. Kinetic measurements of Pol II elongation in vivo,  Pol II ChIP, as well as use of Spliceostatin and Meayamycin splicing inhibitors  showed that polymerase elongation rates were uncoupled from ongoing splicing.  This study shows that transcription elongation kinetics proceed independently of  splicing at the model genes studied here. Surprisingly, retention of  polyadenylated mRNA was detected at the transcription site after transcription  termination. This suggests that the polymerase is released from chromatin prior  to the completion of splicing, and the pre-mRNA is post-transcriptionally  processed while still tethered to chromatin near the gene end."", 'Splicing is the removal of intron sequences from pre-mRNA by the spliceosome.  Researchers working in multiple model organisms - notably yeast, insects and  mammalian cells - have shown that pre-mRNA can be spliced during the process of  transcription (i.e. co-transcriptionally), as well as after transcription  termination (i.e. post-transcriptionally). Co-transcriptional splicing does not  assume that transcription and splicing machineries are mechanistically coupled,  yet it raises this possibility. Early studies were based on a limited number of  genes, which were often chosen because of their experimental accessibility.  Since 2010, eight studies have used global datasets as counting tools, in order  to quantify co-transcriptional intron removal. The consensus view, based on four  organisms, is that the majority of splicing events take place  co-transcriptionally in most cells and tissues. Here, we discuss the nature of  the various global datasets and how bioinformatic analyses were conducted.  Considering the broad differences in experimental approach and analysis, the  level of agreement on the prevalence of co-transcriptional splicing is  remarkable.', ""The carboxy-terminal domain (CTD) of the large subunit of RNA polymerase II (pol  II) is essential for several co-transcriptional pre-messenger RNA processing  events, including capping, 3'-end processing and splicing. We investigated the  role of the CTD of RNA pol II in the coordination of A to I editing and splicing  of the ADAR2 (ADAR: adenosine deaminases that act on RNA) pre-mRNA. The  auto-editing of Adar2 intron 4 by the ADAR2 adenosine deaminase is tightly  coupled to splicing, as the modification of the dinucleotide AA to AI creates a  new 3' splice site. Unlike other introns, the CTD is not required for efficient  splicing of intron 4 at either the normal 3' splice site or the alternative site  created by editing. However, the CTD is required for efficient  co-transcriptional auto-editing of ADAR2 intron 4. Our results implicate the CTD  in site-selective RNA editing by ADAR2 and in coordination of editing with  alternative splicing."", ""In metazoan organisms, pre-mRNA splicing is thought to occur during  transcription, and it is postulated that these two processes are functionally  coupled via still-unknown mechanisms. Current evidence supports  co-transcriptional spliceosomal assembly, but there is little quantitative  information on how much splicing is completed during RNA synthesis. Here we  isolate nascent chromatin-associated RNA from free, nucleoplasmic RNA already  released from the DNA template. Using a quantitative RT-PCR assay, we show that  the majority of introns separating constitutive exons are already excised from  the human c-Src and fibronectin pre-mRNAs that are still in the process of  synthesis, and that these introns are removed in a general 5'-to-3' order.  Introns flanking alternative exons in these transcripts are also removed during  synthesis, but show differences in excision efficiency between cell lines with  different regulatory conditions. Our data suggest that skipping of an exon can  induce a lag in splicing compared to intron removal under conditions of exon  inclusion. Nevertheless, excision of the long intron encompassing the skipped  exon is still completed prior to transcript release into the nucleoplasm. Thus,  we demonstrate that the decision to include or skip an alternative exon is made  during transcription and not post-transcriptionally."", 'Transcriptome sequencing allows for analysis of mature RNAs at base pair  resolution. Here we show that RNA-seq can also be used for studying nascent RNAs  undergoing transcription. We sequenced total RNA from human brain and liver and  found a large fraction of reads (up to 40%) within introns. Intronic RNAs were  abundant in brain tissue, particularly for genes involved in axonal growth and  synaptic transmission. Moreover, we detected significant differences in intronic  RNA levels between fetal and adult brains. We show that the pattern of intronic  sequence read coverage is explained by nascent transcription in combination with  co-transcriptional splicing. Further analysis of co-transcriptional splicing  indicates a correlation between slowly removed introns and alternative splicing.  Our data show that sequencing of total RNA provides unique insight into the  transcriptional processes in the cell, with particular importance for normal  brain development.', 'Over time eukaryotic genomes have evolved to host genes carrying multiple exons  separated by increasingly larger intronic, mostly non-protein-coding, sequences.  Initially, little attention was paid to these intronic sequences, as they were  considered not to contain regulatory information. However, advances in molecular  biology, sequencing, and computational tools uncovered that numerous segments  within these genomic elements do contribute to the regulation of gene  expression. Introns are differentially removed in a cell type-specific manner to  produce a range of alternatively-spliced transcripts, and many span tens to  hundreds of kilobases. Recent work in human and fruitfly tissues revealed that  long introns are extensively processed cotranscriptionally and in a stepwise  manner, before their two flanking exons are spliced together. This process,  called ""recursive splicing,"" often involves non-canonical splicing elements  positioned deep within introns, and different mechanisms for its deployment have  been proposed. Still, the very existence and widespread nature of recursive  splicing offers a new regulatory layer in the transcript maturation pathway,  which may also have implications in human disease.', 'Alternative splicing has emerged as a key contributor to proteome diversity,  highlighting the importance of understanding its regulation. In recent years it  became apparent that splicing is predominantly cotranscriptional, allowing for  crosstalk between these two nuclear processes. We discuss some of the links  between transcription and splicing, with special emphasis on the role played by  transcription elongation in the regulation of alternative splicing events and in  particular the kinetic model of alternative splicing regulation. This article is  part of a Special Issue entitled: RNA polymerase II Transcript Elongation.', 'BACKGROUND: RNA-seq data is currently underutilized, in part because it is  difficult to predict the functional impact of alternate transcription events.  Recent software improvements in full-length transcript deconvolution prompted us  to develop spliceR, an R package for classification of alternative splicing and  prediction of coding potential. RESULTS: spliceR uses the full-length transcript output from RNA-seq assemblers  to detect single or multiple exon skipping, alternative donor and acceptor  sites, intron retention, alternative first or last exon usage, and mutually  exclusive exon events. For each of these events spliceR also annotates the  genomic coordinates of the differentially spliced elements, facilitating  downstream sequence analysis. For each transcript isoform fraction values are  calculated to identify transcript switching between conditions. Lastly, spliceR  predicts the coding potential, as well as the potential nonsense mediated decay  (NMD) sensitivity of each transcript. CONCLUSIONS: spliceR is an easy-to-use tool that extends the usability of  RNA-seq and assembly technologies by allowing greater depth of annotation of  RNA-seq data. spliceR is implemented as an R package and is freely available  from the Bioconductor repository (  http://www.bioconductor.org/packages/2.13/bioc/html/spliceR.html).', 'MOTIVATION: Alternative splicing (AS) is a pre-mRNA maturation process leading  to the expression of multiple mRNA variants from the same primary transcript.  More than 90% of human genes are expressed via AS. Therefore, quantifying the  inclusion level of every exon is crucial for generating accurate transcriptomic  maps and studying the regulation of AS. RESULTS: Here we introduce SpliceTrap, a method to quantify exon inclusion  levels using paired-end RNA-seq data. Unlike other tools, which focus on  full-length transcript isoforms, SpliceTrap approaches the expression-level  estimation of each exon as an independent Bayesian inference problem. In  addition, SpliceTrap can identify major classes of alternative splicing events  under a single cellular condition, without requiring a background set of reads  to estimate relative splicing changes. We tested SpliceTrap both by simulation  and real data analysis, and compared it to state-of-the-art tools for transcript  quantification. SpliceTrap demonstrated improved accuracy, robustness and  reliability in quantifying exon-inclusion ratios. CONCLUSIONS: SpliceTrap is a useful tool to study alternative splicing  regulation, especially for accurate quantification of local exon-inclusion  ratios from RNA-seq data. AVAILABILITY AND IMPLEMENTATION: SpliceTrap can be implemented online through  the CSH Galaxy server http://cancan.cshl.edu/splicetrap and is also available  for download and installation at http://rulai.cshl.edu/splicetrap/.

SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: Supplementary data are available at Bioinformatics  online.', 'Recent ChIP experiments indicate that spliceosome assembly and splicing can  occur cotranscriptionally in S. cerevisiae. However, only a few genes have been  examined, and all have long second exons. To extend these studies, we analyzed  intron-containing genes with different second exon lengths by using ChIP as well  as whole-genome tiling arrays (ChIP-CHIP). The data indicate that U1 snRNP  recruitment is independent of exon length. Recursive splicing constructs, which  uncouple U1 recruitment from transcription, suggest that cotranscriptional U1  recruitment contributes to optimal splicing efficiency. In contrast, U2 snRNP  recruitment, as well as cotranscriptional splicing, is deficient on short second  exon genes. We estimate that > or =90% of endogenous yeast splicing is  posttranscriptional, consistent with an analysis of posttranscriptional  snRNP-associated pre-mRNA.']","The consensus view, based on four organisms, is that the majority of splicing events take place co-transcriptionally in most cells and tissues.

170,What histone modification is recognized by the bromodomain?,"['Bromodomain factor 1 (Bdf1) associates with Saccharomyces cerevisiae TFIID and  corresponds to the C-terminal half of higher eukaryotic TAF1. It also associates  with the SWR-C complex, which is important for Htz1 deposition. Bdf1 binds  preferentially to acetylated histone H4. Bdf1 is phosphorylated, but the  mechanism and significance of this modification have been unclear. Two distinct  regions within Bdf1 are phosphorylated; one is just C terminal to the  bromodomains and the other is near the C terminus. Mutational analysis shows  that phosphorylation is necessary for Bdf1 function in vivo. Endogenous protein  kinase CK2 purifies with Bdf1 and phosphorylates both domains. A similar  mechanism may be responsible for phosphorylation of the C-terminal region of  mammalian TAF1. These findings suggest that CK2 phosphorylation of Bdf1 may  regulate RNA polymerase II transcription and/or chromatin structure.', 'The posttranslational modification of chromatin through acetylation at selected  histone lysine residues is governed by histone acetyltransferases (HATs) and  histone deacetylases (HDACs). The significance of this subset of the epigenetic  code is interrogated and interpreted by an acetyllysine-specific protein-protein  interaction with bromodomain reader modules. Selective inhibition of the bromo  and extra C-terminal domain (BET) family of bromodomains with a small molecule  is feasible, and this may represent an opportunity for disease intervention  through the recently disclosed antiproliferative and anti-inflammatory  properties of such inhibitors. Herein, we describe the discovery and  structure-activity relationship (SAR) of a novel, small-molecule chemical probe  for BET family inhibition that was identified through the application of  structure-based fragment assessment and optimization techniques. This has  yielded a potent, selective compound with cell-based activity (PFI-1) that may  further add to the understanding of BET family function within the bromodomains.', 'Studies showed that the bromodomain binds to acetyl-lysines on histone tails,  which is involved in deciphering the histone codes. BRD7, a novel bromodomain  gene, is the first described bromodomain gene involved in nasopharyngeal  carcinoma (NPC). Previous studies showed that ectopic expression of BRD7  inhibited cell growth and cell cycle progression from G1 to S phase in HNE1  cells (a NPC cell line) by transcriptionally regulating some cell cycle related  genes including E2F3 gene. In the present study, we revealed the co-localization  between acetylated H3 and BRD7 and found that the bromodomain of BRD7 is  required for this co-localization. More importantly, wild-type BRD7 interacted  with H3 peptide acetylated at Lys14, while the bromodomain deleted mutant lost  this ability. We also found that the mutant BRD7 failed to regulate E2F3  promoter activity and inhibit cell cycle progression. These results indicated  that the transcriptional regulation role of BRD7 was achieved by binding to  acetylated histone H3 and that the bromodomain was essential for this role. In  addition, no obvious changes were observed in the acetylated level of histone H3  after transfection with BRD7, indicating that chromatin remodeling, not  chromatin modification, is the major mechanism of BRD7 mediated gene  transcription. Taken together, the present work shed light on the fact that a  novel bromodomain gene, BRD7, is of importance in transcriptional regulation and  cellular events including cell cycle.', 'Double bromodomain proteins bind to acetylated lysines in histones, bringing  associated histone modification and nucleosome remodeling activity to chromatin.  The ability of bromodomain regulators to alter chromatin status and control gene  expression has long been appreciated to be important in the development of  certain human cancers. However, bromodomain proteins have now been found also to  be critical, non-redundant players in diverse, non-malignant phenotypes,  directing transcriptional programs that control adipogenesis, energy metabolism  and inflammation. The fact that such different processes are functionally linked  by the same molecular machinery suggests a common epigenetic basis to understand  and interpret the origins of several important co-morbidities, such as asthma or  cancer that occurs in obesity, and complex inflammatory diseases like  cardiovascular disease, systemic lupus erythematosus, rheumatoid arthritis and  insulin resistance that may be built on a common pro-inflammatory foundation.', 'Little is known about how combinations of histone marks are interpreted at the  level of nucleosomes. The second PHD finger of human BPTF is known to  specifically recognize histone H3 when methylated on lysine 4 (H3K4me2/3). Here,  we examine how additional heterotypic modifications influence BPTF binding.  Using peptide surrogates, three acetyllysine ligands are indentified for a  PHD-adjacent bromodomain in BPTF via systematic screening and biophysical  characterization. Although the bromodomain displays limited discrimination among  the three possible acetyllysines at the peptide level, marked selectivity is  observed for only one of these sites, H4K16ac, in combination with H3K4me3 at  the mononucleosome level. In support, these two histone marks constitute a  unique trans-histone modification pattern that unambiguously resides within a  single nucleosomal unit in human cells, and this module colocalizes with these  marks in the genome. Together, our data call attention to nucleosomal patterning  of covalent marks in dictating critical chromatin associations.', 'Methylation of histone lysine residues in eukaryotic chromatin has been an  exciting area of research ever since the first histone methyltransferase enzyme,  Suv39h, was found to methylate lysine 9 of histone H3 in 2000. Only a year  later, the HP1 chromodomain polypeptide was identified as a recognition module  for this histone modification. Similar to bromodomain-containing proteins that  recognize histone acetylation sites and subsequently stabilize large complexes  to chromatin, effector proteins can also be recruited and stabilized by histone  methylation. Although histone acetylation generally correlates with active  transcription, histone methylation is associated with both the activation and  silencing of transcription, depending on which lysine residue is modified. The  list of proteins that may in fact directly associate with specific methylated  histone lysines is expanding. Since the finding of HP1, many additional proteins  have been shown to bind methylated histone residues. For instance, Polycomb,  Chd1, 53BP1, and Crb2/Rad9 proteins all associate with methylated chromatin in a  unique manner governed by their respective recognition motifs. Here we highlight  recent data on the recognition specificity and biological significance of  proteins that associate with methylated histone lysines.', 'The access of transcription factors to eukaryotic promoters often requires  modification of their chromatin structure, which is accomplished by the action  of two general classes of multiprotein complexes. One class contains histone  acetyltransferases (HATs), such as Gcn5 in the SAGA complex, which acetylate  nucleosomal histones. The second class contains ATPases, such as Swi2 in the  Swi/Snf complex, which provide the energy for nucleosome remodelling. In several  promoters these two complexes cooperate but their functional linkage is unknown.  A protein module that is present in all nuclear HATs, the bromodomain, could  provide such a link. The recently reported in vitro binding of a HAT bromodomain  with acetylated lysines within H3 and H4 amino-terminal peptides indicates that  this interaction may constitute a targeting step for events that follow histone  acetylation. Here we use a suitable promoter to show that bromodomain residues  essential for acetyl-lysine binding are not required in vivo for Gcn5-mediated  histone acetylation but are fundamental for the subsequent Swi2-dependent  nucleosome remodelling and consequent transcriptional activation. We show that  the Gcn5 bromodomain stabilizes the Swi/Snf complex on this promoter.', 'As a member of the bromodomain and extraterminal (BET) family, BRD4 (bromodomain  containing 4) can bind to acetylated histones and transcription factors, and is  also able to recruit various transcriptional regulators. Previous studies have  shown that BRD4 mainly plays a positive role in cell growth and cell cycle  progression. In a recent study conducted by Sakamaki et\xa0al., the authors found  that BRD4 acts as a transcriptional repressor in regulating  macroautophagy/autophagy and lysosome gene expression, via binding to the  histone lysine methyltransferase EHMT2/G9a. The oncoprotein BRD4-NUTM1/NUT also  helps block autophagy and lysosome functions. A knockdown of BRD4 allows the  retention of MTOR activity during starvation and significantly undermines  starvation-induced cell death. However, BRD4 repression only contributes to  stimulus-dependent autophagy and aggrephagy, and is not involved in other types  of selective autophagy. Taken together, the newly reported repressive role of  BRD4 in autophagy adds to our understanding of how autophagy and lysosome  functions are regulated at the transcriptional level.', 'Defining the protein factors that directly recognize post-translational,  covalent histone modifications is essential toward understanding the impact of  these chromatin ""marks"" on gene regulation. In the current study, we identify  human CHD1, an ATP-dependent chromatin remodeling protein, as a factor that  directly and selectively recognizes histone H3 methylated on lysine 4. In vitro  binding studies identified that CHD1 recognizes di- and trimethyl H3K4 with a  dissociation constant (Kd) of approximately 5 microm, whereas monomethyl H3K4  binds CHD1 with a 3-fold lower affinity. Surprisingly, human CHD1 binds to  methylated H3K4 in a manner that requires both of its tandem chromodomains. In  vitro analyses demonstrate that unlike human CHD1, yeast Chd1 does not bind  methylated H3K4. Our findings indicate that yeast and human CHD1 have diverged  in their ability to discriminate covalently modified histones and link histone  modification-recognition and non-covalent chromatin remodeling activities within  a single human protein.', 'Hormone-dependent gene expression requires dynamic and coordinated epigenetic  changes. Estrogen receptor-positive (ER+) breast cancer is particularly  dependent upon extensive chromatin remodeling and changes in histone  modifications for the induction of hormone-responsive gene expression. Our  previous studies established an important role of bromodomain-containing  protein-4 (BRD4) in promoting estrogen-regulated transcription and proliferation  of ER+ breast cancer cells. Here, we investigated the association between  genome-wide occupancy of histone H4 acetylation at lysine 12 (H4K12ac) and BRD4  in the context of estrogen-induced transcription. Similar to BRD4, we observed  that H4K12ac occupancy increases near the transcription start sites (TSS) of  estrogen-induced genes as well as at distal ERα binding sites in an  estrogen-dependent manner. Interestingly, H4K12ac occupancy highly correlates  with BRD4 binding and enhancer RNA production on ERα-positive enhancers.  Consistent with an importance in estrogen-induced gene transcription, H4K12ac  occupancy globally increased in ER-positive cells relative to ER-negative cells  and these levels were further increased by estrogen treatment in an  ERα-dependent manner. Together, these findings reveal a strong correlation  between H4K12ac and BRD4 occupancy with estrogen-dependent gene transcription  and further suggest that modulators of H4K12ac and BRD4 may serve as new  therapeutic targets for hormone-dependent cancers.']",Acetylated lysines in histones (generally H3 and H4)
171,What tissue is most affected in Ehlers-Danlos syndromes?,"['BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVES: Ehlers-Danlos syndromes (EDS) are a heterogeneous  group of heritable connective tissue disorders. Gastrointestinal manifestations  in EDS have been described but their frequency, nature and impact are poorly  known. We aimed to assess digestive features in a national cohort of EDS  patients. METHODS: A questionnaire has been sent to 212 EDS patients through the French  patient support group, all of which had been formally diagnosed according to the  Villefranche criteria. The questionnaire included questions about digestive  functional symptoms, the GIQLI (Gastrointestinal Quality of Life Index), KESS  scoring system and the Rome III criteria. RESULTS: Overall, 135 patients (64% response rate) completed the questionnaire  and 134 were analyzable (123 women; 91%). Mean age and Body Mass Index were  respectively 35±14.7 years and 24.3±6.1 kg/m(2). The most common EDS subtype was  hypermobility form (n=108; 80.6%). GIQLI and KESS median values were  respectively 63.5 (27-117) and 19 [13.5-22]. Eighty four percent of patients had  functional bowel disorders (FBD) according to the Rome III criteria. An  irritable bowel syndrome according to the same criteria was observed in 64  patients (48%) and 48 patients (36%) reported functional constipation. A  gastro-esophageal reflux disease (GERD) was reported in 90 patients (68.7%),  significantly associated with a poorer GIQLI (60.5±16.8 versus 75.9±20.3;  p<0.0001). GIQLI was also negatively impacted by the presence of an irritable  bowel syndrome or functional constipation (p=0.007). There was a significant  correlation between FBD and GERD. CONCLUSIONS: Natural frequency of gastrointestinal manifestations in EDS seems  higher than previously assessed. FBD and GERD are very common in our study  population, the largest ever published until now. Their impact is herein shown  to be important. A systematic clinical assessment of digestive features should  be recommended in EDS.', 'The Ehlers-Danlos Syndrome (EDS) is a rare connective tissue disorder  characterised by fragility of the soft connective tissues and widespread  manifestations in skin, ligaments, joints, blood vessels and internal organs. We  report a case of a 12-year-old boy, previously diagnosed with  kyphoscoliosis-type EDS (type VI), presenting with a left brachial artery  pseudo-aneursym with history of multiple spontaneous and post-traumatic arterial  ruptures. Surgical management of this patient was performed successfully by  primary repair of brachial artery lesion.', 'BACKGROUND/AIMS: Ehlers-Danlos syndromes (EDSs) constitute a rare group of  inherited connective tissue diseases, characterized by multisystemic  manifestations and general tissue fragility. Most severe complications include  vascular and gastrointestinal (GI) emergencies requiring acute surgery. The  purpose of this systematic review was to assess the causes of GI-related surgery  and related mortality and morbidity in patients with EDSs. METHODS: A systematic search was conducted in PubMed, Embase, and Scopus to  identify relevant studies. Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and  Meta-Analysis guidelines for systematic reviews were followed. According to  eligibility criteria, data were extracted and systematically screened by 2  authors. RESULTS: Screening process identified 11 studies with a total of 1,567 patients.  Findings indicated that patients with EDSs had a higher occurrence of surgery  demanding GI manifestations, including perforation, hemorrhage, rupture of  intra-abdominal organs, and rectal prolapse. Most affected was the vascular  subtype, of which up to 33% underwent GI surgery and suffered from a lowered  average life expectancy of 48 years (range 6-78). Secondary complications of  surgery were common in all patients with EDSs. CONCLUSION: Studies suggested that patients with EDSs present an increased need  for GI surgery, but also an increased risk of surgery-related complications,  most predominantly seen in the vascular subtype.', ""The Ehlers-Danlos syndrome is characterized by abnormal connective tissue but  bone involvement is debated. We found a reduced BMD and bone quality and  increased prevalence of asymptomatic vertebral fractures in eugonadal patients  with Ehlers-Danlos syndrome. These findings suggest the need of a bone health  evaluation in these patients. INTRODUCTION: The Ehlers-Danlos (EDS) syndrome is characterized by abnormalities  of the connective tissue leading to ligamentous laxity and skin and tissue  fragility. We evaluated the bone metabolism, bone mineral density (BMD) and bone  quality (measured by trabecular bone score, TBS), and the prevalence of  vertebral fractures (VFx) in a group of eugonadal adult EDS patients. METHODS: Fifty consecutive Caucasian patients, aged 30-50\xa0years (36 females, 14  males) with classical or hypermobility EDS and 50 age-, gender-, and body mass  index (BMI)-matched control subjects were enrolled. In all subjects'  calcium-phosphorous metabolism, bone turnover, BMD at the lumbar spine (LS) and  femur (femoral neck, FN and total femur, FT) and TBS by dual-energy X-ray  absorptiometry, and the VFx presence by spine radiograph were assessed. RESULTS: Patients showed reduced BMD (Z-scores LS -0.45\u2009±\u20091.00, FN -0.56\u2009±\u20091.01,  FT -0.58\u2009±\u20090.92) and TBS (1.299\u2009±\u20090.111) and increased prevalence of  morphometric VFx (32\xa0%) than controls (Z-scores LS 0.09\u2009±\u20091.22, FN 0.01\u2009±\u20090.97,  FT 0.08\u2009±\u20090.89; TBS 1.382\u2009±\u20090.176; VFx 8\xa0%, p <0.05 for all comparisons), while  vitamin D levels, calcium-phosphorous metabolism, and bone turnover were  comparable. Fractured EDS patients showed lower TBS values than non-fractured  ones (1.245\u2009±\u20090.138 vs 1.325\u2009±\u20090.086, p\u2009<\u20090.05), despite comparable BMD. In EDS  patients, the VFx presence was significantly associated with TBS even after  adjusting for sex, age, BMD, EDS type, and falls frequency. CONCLUSIONS: EDS patients have reduced BMD and bone quality (as measured by TBS)  and increased prevalence of VFx."", ""Ehlers-Danlos syndromes (EDS) and Marfan syndrome (MFS) are multisystemic  disorders that primarily affect the soft connective tissues. Both disorders have  benefited from recent advances in clinical and molecular characterization,  allowing improvements in clinical diagnosis and management. EDS are a  heterogeneous group of conditions characterized by skin hyperextensibility,  atrophic scarring, joint hypermobility and generalized tissue fragility. The  current classification proposes six subtypes based on clinical, biochemical and  molecular characteristics. However, examples of unclassified variants and  'overlap phenotypes' are becoming more common. Mutations in genes encoding  fibrillar collagens or collagen-modifying enzymes have been identified in most  forms of EDS, including the classic and vascular subtypes (collagen type V and  III, respectively), and the rare arthrochalasis, kyphoscoliosis and  dermatosparaxis variants (type I collagen defects). To date, the genetic  background of the hypermobility type of EDS remains unclear, although some new  insights have been gained recently. MFS is an autosomal-dominant disorder that  affects the cardiovascular, ocular and skeletal system with aortic root  dilation/dissection, ectopia lentis and bone overgrowth, respectively. Advances  in therapeutic, mainly surgical, techniques have improved median survival  significantly, yet severe morbidity and a substantial risk for premature  mortality remain associated. The disorder is caused by mutations in the FBN1  gene, encoding the microfibrillar protein fibrillin-1. Recently, new insights in  the pathogenesis changed the prevailing concept of this type 1 fibrillinopathy  as a structural disorder of the connective tissue into a developmental  abnormality manifesting perturbed cytokine signalling.

Periventricular nodular heterotopia (PNH) is a  human neuronal migration disorder characterised by seizures and conglomerates of  neural cells around the lateral ventricles of the brain, caused by FLNA  mutations. FLNA encodes filamin A, an actin binding protein involved in  cytoskeletal organisation. The amino-terminal actin binding domain (ABD) of  filamins contains two tandem calponin homology domains, CHD1 and CHD2. OBJECTIVE: To report clinical and genetic analyses in a Spanish family affected  by a connective tissue disorder suggestive of EDS type III and PNH. METHODS: A clinical and molecular study was undertaken in the three affected  women. Clinical histories, physical and neurological examinations, brain  magnetic resonance imaging studies, and skin biopsies were done. Genetic  analysis of the FLNA gene was undertaken by direct sequencing and restriction  fragment length polymorphism analysis. RESULTS: Mutation analysis of the FLNA gene resulted in the identification of a  novel mutation in exon 3 (c.383C-->T) segregating with the combination of both  syndromes. This mutation results in a substitution of an alanine residue (A128V)  in CHD1. CONCLUSIONS: The findings suggest that the Ala128Val mutation causes the dual  EDS-PNH phenotype. This association constitutes a new variant within the EDS  spectrum. This is the first description of a familial EDS-PNH association with a  mutation in FLNA.', 'Ehlers-Danlos syndrome is a heterogeneous group of heritable connective tissue  disorders characterized by increased fragility of various non-ossified tissues.  It is usually ascertained due to abnormal skin texture, scarring complications,  vascular fragility, or chronic symptoms, such as fatigue and musculoskeletal  pain. Sometimes, Ehlers-Danlos syndrome remains undetected until the patient,  usually in the pediatric age, shows extensive or severe mucocutaneous injuries  after only minor traumas. In this scenario, the misdiagnosis of Ehlers-Danlos  syndrome with child abuse is a possibility, as occasionally reported in the  literature. Recently, more attention was posed by lay people between the  possible association of Ehlers-Danlos syndrome and bone fragility. Literature  and personal experience show a strong association between Ehlers-Danlos  syndrome, generalized joint hypermobility and reduced bone mass density in older  children and adults, especially fertile women. The existence of a true increased  risk of fracture in Ehlers-Danlos syndrome is still a matter of debate in  children and adults with little and conflicting evidence. In case of suspected  child abuse, Ehlers-Danlos syndrome is certainly on the differential for  bruising, especially in EDS types with marked cutaneous and capillary  involvement. In suspected child abuse cases, careful examination of the index  case and her/his extended family is routine, as well as exclusion of other  disorders such as osteogenesis imperfecta. The hypothesis of Ehlers-Danlos  syndrome as an alternative explanation for infantile fractures remains  speculative.', 'The classic form of Ehlers-Danlos syndrome (cEDS) is an inherited connective  tissue disorder, where mutations in type V collagen-encoding genes result in  abnormal collagen fibrils. Thus the cEDS patients have pathological connective  tissue morphology and low stiffness, but the rate of connective tissue protein  turnover is unknown. We investigated whether cEDS affected the protein synthesis  rate in skin and tendon, and whether this could be stimulated in tendon tissue  with insulin-like growth factor-I (IGF-I). Five patients with cEDS and 10  healthy, matched controls (CTRL) were included. One patellar tendon of each  participant was injected with 0.1 ml IGF-I (Increlex, Ipsen, 10 mg/ml) and the  contralateral tendon with 0.1 ml isotonic saline as control. The injections were  performed at both 24 and 6 h prior to tissue sampling. The fractional synthesis  rate (FSR) of proteins in skin and tendon was measured with the stable isotope  technique using a flood-primed continuous infusion over 6 h. After the infusion  one skin biopsy and two tendon biopsies (one from each patellar tendon) were  obtained. We found similar baseline FSR values in skin and tendon in the cEDS  patients and controls [skin: 0.005 ± 0.002 (cEDS) and 0.007 ± 0.002 (CTRL);  tendon: 0.008 ± 0.001 (cEDS) and 0.009 ± 0.002 (CTRL) %/h, mean ± SE]. IGF-I  injections significantly increased FSR values in cEDS patients but not in  controls (delta values: cEDS 0.007 ± 0.002, CTRL 0.001 ± 0.001%/h). In  conclusion, baseline protein synthesis rates in connective tissue appeared  normal in cEDS patients, and the patients responded with an increased tendon  protein synthesis rate to IGF-I injections.', 'Ehlers-Danlos syndrome is an inherited connective tissue disorder. Clinical  manifestations of this syndrome are due to fragile connective tissue. Though  many cardiovascular disorders in association with it have been reported,  myocardial infarction is quite rare. In this report, two cases with type 4  Ehlers-Danlos syndrome and myocardial infarction are described. Patient 1 was a  30-year-old woman. She was diagnosed as having myocardial infarction on the  basis of typical changes in electrocardiograms and serum enzymes (CPK, SGOT and  LDH). The diagnosis of type 4 Ehlers-Danlos syndrome was made by the microscopic  examination of her connective tissue. Patient 2 was a 32-year-old man. He was  also diagnosed as having acute myocardial infarction. His fibroblasts were  cultured and they could not synthesize type 3 collagen. Type 4 Ehlers-Danlos  syndrome was diagnosed. It was likely that myocardial infarction might have  resulted from the fragility of their coronary arteries in type 4 Ehlers-Danlos  syndrome.', 'Type V collagen mutations are associated with classic Ehlers-Danlos Syndrome  (EDS), but it is unknown for which proportion they account and to what extent  other genes are involved. We analyzed COL5A1 and COL5A2 in 126 patients with a  diagnosis or suspicion of classic EDS. In 93 patients, a type V collagen defect  was found, of which 73 were COL5A1 mutations, 13 were COL5A2 mutations and seven  were COL5A1 null-alleles with mutation unknown. The majority of the 73 COL5A1  mutations generated a COL5A1 null-allele, whereas one-third were structural  mutations, scattered throughout COL5A1. All COL5A2 mutations were structural  mutations. Reduced availability of type V collagen appeared to be the major  disease-causing mechanism, besides other intra- and extracellular contributing  factors. All type V collagen defects were identified within a group of 102  patients fulfilling all major clinical Villefranche criteria, that is, skin  hyperextensibility, dystrophic scarring and joint hypermobility. No  COL5A1/COL5A2 mutation was detected in 24 patients who displayed skin and joint  hyperextensibility but lacked dystrophic scarring. Overall, over 90% of patients  fulfilling all major Villefranche criteria for classic EDS were shown to harbor  a type V collagen defect, which indicates that this is the major--if not  only--cause of classic EDS.']","the ehlers-danlos syndromes (eds) are a group of connective tissue disorders characterized by triad of joint hypermobility, skin extensibility, and tissue fragility."

Twiddler  syndrome is characterized by intentional or inadvertent manipulation of  implanted devices in the pacemaker pocket. We describe an unusual case of an  8-year-old girl who had both syndromes.', 'We report upon a case of total retraction of an electrode (Twiddler syndrom) in  an infected pacemaker battery. The silk-thread fixation was still fastened at  the right place on the electrode; the tissue owing to the inflammation was no  longer sufficient as a fixation point. The casues of this total retraction of  the electrode are the following factors: the battery hat sufficient freedom of  movement for rotation following exudation into the pacemaker cavity, the  electrode was elastic and above all the pacemaker system was infected which  could no longer guarantee a sufficient fixation of the electrode in the infected  tissue. Attention is drawn to the necessity to remove an infected pacemaker  system.', 'Publisher: Le syndrome de Twiddler est une cause exceptionnelle de dysfonction  de prothèses cardiaques résultant d’un déplacement de sonde secondaire à la  manipulation délibérée ou inconsciente du boîtier.

L’originalité de cette observation est  soulignée par la survenue d’un bloc auriculoventriculaire syncopal inaugural  jusque-là méconnu révélant un syndrome de Twiddler chez un patient initialement  implanté d’un défibrillateur en prévention secondaire pour une fibrillation  ventriculaire idiopathique.', 'BACKGROUND: Bobble-head doll syndrome is a rare and surgically treatable  movement disorder characterized by up-and-down (yes-yes) head bobbing occurring  at a rate of 2-3 Hz. Side-to-side (no-no) head bobbing is less frequently  described. Bobble-head doll syndrome is usually associated with dilation of the  third ventricle, but is rarely associated with posterior fossa disease. PATIENT: We describe an infant with fetal hydrocephalus and an arachnoid cyst of  the posterior fossa. Endoscopic fenestration of the arachnoid cyst was performed  on postnatal day 12. A routine examination at 4 months indicated the infant  showed ""no-no"" type head bobbing, but no other neurological disorder was  observed. The third ventricle was dilated during the perioperative period, but  not at 2-4 months. In contrast, cerebellar compression decreased gradually and  persisted at 4 months. CONCLUSION: Although few patients with bobble-head doll syndrome do not have  third ventricle dilation, these patients typically show cerebellar dysfunction.  Our findings support the hypothesis that cerebellar dysfunction is present in  bobble-head doll syndrome when third ventricle dilation is absent.', 'Bobble-head doll syndrome (BHDS) is a rare pediatric movement disorder  presenting with involuntary 2- to 3-Hz head movements. Common signs and symptoms  also found on presentation include macrocephaly, ataxia, developmental delay,  optic disc pallor or atrophy, hyperreflexia, tremor, obesity, endocrinopathy,  visual disturbance or impairment, headache, and vomiting, among others. The  syndrome is associated with suprasellar cysts, third ventricular cysts, or  aqueductal obstruction, along with a few other less common conditions. The cause  of involuntary head motions is not understood. Treatment is surgical. The  authors present 2 cases of BHDS. The first is a 14-year-old boy with BHDS  associated with aqueductal obstruction and triventricular hydrocephalus  secondary to a tectal tumor. He was successfully treated by endoscopic third  ventriculostomy, and all symptoms resolved immediately in the recovery room.  This case is unusual in its late age of symptom onset, the primacy of lateral  (""no-no"") involuntary head rotations, and the associated tectal tumor. The  second case is a 7.5-year-old girl with BHDS associated with a suprasellar cyst.  She was successfully treated with an endoscopic fenestration but preexisting  endocrinopathy persisted, and the patient was diagnosed with autism spectrum  disorder at age 12 years. This second case is more typical of BHDS. A  comprehensive and up-to-date review of the literature of BHDS and video  documentation of the phenomenon are presented.', 'Nutcracker esophagus and jackhammer esophagus are largely unknown motility  disorders, also sometimes called hypertensive and hypercontractile peristalsis,  respectively. There is currently no standardized diagnostic or management plan  for these diseases. Here, we report on three patients with jackhammer/nutcracker  esophagus who were treated with either peroral endoscopic myotomy or a systemic  steroid regimen, focusing particularly on two novel presentations of nutcracker  and jackhammer esophagus involving eosinophilic infiltration into the muscularis  propria, and their responses to both interventions.', 'Hypercontractile esophagus (nicknamed jackhammer esophagus) is a recently  defined disease within the esophageal motility disorders classification.  Responses to treatments for jackhammer esophagus have been inconsistent in  previous trials, possibly due to its heterogeneous manifestation. Thus, we  reviewed 10 patients diagnosed with jackhammer esophagus and compared their  clinical and manometric features at baseline. Additionally, manometric and  symptomatic responses after treatment with known smooth muscle relaxants,  including anticholinergic drugs (cimetropium bromide and scopolamine  butylbromide) and a phosphodiesterase-5 inhibitor (sildenafil) were compared. We  observed two distinct subgroups in the findings: one with hypercontractility and  normal distal latencies (""classic jackhammer esophagus,"" n=7) and the other with  hypercontractility and short distal latencies (""spastic jackhammer esophagus,""  n=3). The two types also differed in their responses to medications in that  symptoms improved upon treatment with an anticholinergic agent in classic  jackhammer esophagus patients, while spastic jackhammer esophagus was  unresponsive to both the anticholinergic drugs and the phosphodiesterase-5  inhibitor. In conclusion, hypercontractile esophagus may be a heterogeneous  disease with different underlying pathophysiologies. We introduced two novel  terms, ""classic jackhammer esophagus"" and ""spastic jackhammer esophagus,"" to  distinguish the two types.', 'The concept of esophageal spastic disorders encompasses spastic achalasia,  distal esophageal spasm, and jackhammer esophagus. These are conceptually  distinct in that spastic achalasia and distal esophageal spasm are characterized  by a loss of neural inhibition, whereas jackhammer esophagus is associated with  hypercontractility. Hypercontractility may also occur as a result of  esophagogastric junction outflow obstruction or inflammation. The diagnosis of  jackhammer esophagus as a primary motility disorder is based on the  characteristic manometric findings after ruling out mechanical obstruction and  eosinophilic esophagitis. Despite the differences in pathophysiology among the  esophageal spastic disorders, their management is similar.']",Twiddler syndrome is described as a spontaneous rotation or intentional external manipulation of implanted cardiac or occasionally deep brain stimulation (DBS) devices.
173,What is a P-body (processing body)?,"['In fission yeast, Ppb1, the Ca2+/calmodulin-dependent protein phosphatase  calcineurin regulates multiple biological processes, such as cytokinesis,  Ca2+-homeostasis, membrane trafficking and cell wall integrity. Calcineurin  dephosphorylates the Prz1 transcription factor, leading to its nuclear  translocation and gene expression under the control of CDRE  (calcineurin-dependent response element). Although the calcineurin-mediated  spatial control of downstream transcription factors has been intensively studied  in many organisms, less is known about the spatial regulation of calcineurin on  stresses. Here, we show that heat shock stimulates calcineurin-dependent nuclear  translocation of Prz1 and CDRE-dependent gene expression. Notably, calcineurin  exhibited a dramatic change in subcellular localization, translocating from  diffuse cytoplasmic to dot-like structures on heat shock. The calcineurin dots  colocalized with Dcp2 or Pabp, the constituent of P-bodies or stress granules,  respectively, thus suggesting that calcineurin is a component of RNA granules  under heat shock. Importantly, the calcineurin inhibitor FK506 markedly  inhibited the accumulation of calcineurin granules, whereas the constitutively  active calcineurin strongly accumulated in the granules on heat shock,  suggesting that phosphatase activity is important for calcineurin localization.  Notably, the depletion of calcineurin induced a rapid appearance of Nrd1- and  Pabp-positive RNA granules. The possible roles of calcineurin in response to  heat shock will be discussed.', 'In eukaryotic cells, non-translating mRNAs can accumulate into cytoplasmic mRNP  (messenger ribonucleoprotein) granules such as P-bodies (processing bodies) and  SGs (stress granules). P-bodies contain the mRNA decay and translational  repression machineries and are ubiquitously expressed in mammalian cells and  lower eukaryote species including Saccharomyces cerevisiae, Drosophila  melanogaster and Caenorhabditis elegans. In contrast, SGs are only detected  during cellular stress when translation is inhibited and form from aggregates of  stalled pre-initiation complexes. SGs and P-bodies are related to NGs (neuronal  granules), which are essential in the localization and control of mRNAs in  neurons. Importantly, RNA granules are linked to the cytoskeleton, which plays  an important role in mediating many of their dynamic properties. In the present  review, we discuss how P-bodies, SGs and NGs are linked to cytoskeletal networks  and the importance of these linkages in maintaining localization of their RNA  cargoes.', ""In eukaryotic cells, components of the 5' to 3' mRNA degradation machinery can  undergo a rapid phase transition. The resulting cytoplasmic foci are referred to  as processing bodies (P-bodies). The molecular details of the self-aggregation  process are, however, largely undetermined. Herein, we use a bottom-up approach  that combines NMR spectroscopy, isothermal titration calorimetry, X-ray  crystallography, and fluorescence microscopy to probe if mRNA degradation  factors can undergo phase transitions in\u2005vitro. We show that the  Schizosaccharomyces pombe Dcp2 mRNA decapping enzyme, its prime activator Dcp1,  and the scaffolding proteins Edc3 and Pdc1 are sufficient to reconstitute a  phase-separation process. Intermolecular interactions between the Edc3\u2005LSm  domain and at least 10\u2005helical leucine-rich motifs in Dcp2 and Pdc1 build the  core of the interaction network. We show that blocking of these interactions  interferes with the clustering behavior, both in\u2005vitro and in\u2005vivo."", 'The localization of mRNA forms a key facet of the post-transcriptional control  of gene expression and recent evidence suggests that it may be considerably more  widespread than previously anticipated. For example, defined mRNA-containing  granules can be associated with translational repression or activation.  Furthermore, mRNA P-bodies (processing bodies) harbour much of the mRNA decay  machinery and stress granules are thought to play a role in mRNA storage. In the  present review, we explore the process of mRNA localization in the yeast  Saccharomyces cerevisiae, examining connections between organellar mRNA  localization and the response to stress. We also review recent data suggesting  that even where there is a global relocalization of mRNA, the specificity and  kinetics of this process can be regulated.', 'Numerous mRNAs are degraded in processing bodies (P bodies) in Saccharomyces  cerevisiae. In logarithmically growing cells, only 0-1 P bodies per cell are  detectable. However, the number and appearance of P bodies change once the cell  encounters stress. Here, we show that the polysome-associated mRNA-binding  protein Scp160 interacts with P body components, such as the decapping protein  Dcp2 and the scaffold protein Pat1, presumably, on polysomes. Loss of either  Scp160 or its interaction partner Bfr1 caused the formation of Dcp2-positive  structures. These Dcp2-positive foci contained mRNA, because their formation was  inhibited by the presence of cycloheximide. In addition, Scp160 was required for  proper P body formation because only a subset of bona fide P body components  could assemble into the Dcp2-positive foci in Δscp160 cells. In either Δbfr1 or  Δscp160 cells, P body formation was uncoupled from translational attenuation as  the polysome profile remained unchanged. Collectively, our data suggest that  Bfr1 and Scp160 prevent P body formation under normal growth conditions.', 'The localization of mRNA to defined cytoplasmic sites in eukaryotic cells not  only allows localized protein production but also determines the fate of mRNAs.  For instance, translationally repressed mRNAs localize to P-bodies and stress  granules where their decay and storage, respectively, are directed. Here, we  find that several mRNAs are localized to granules in unstressed, actively  growing cells. These granules play a key role in the stress-dependent formation  of P-bodies. Specific glycolytic mRNAs are colocalized in multiple granules per  cell, which aggregate during P-body formation. Such aggregation is still  observed under conditions or in mutants where P-bodies do not form. In  unstressed cells, the mRNA granules appear associated with active translation;  this might enable a coregulation of protein expression from the same pathways or  complexes. Parallels can be drawn between this coregulation and the advantage of  operons in prokaryotic systems.', 'The APOBEC3 cytidine deaminases play a critical role in host-mediated defense  against exogenous viruses, most notably, human immunodeficiency virus type-1  (HIV-1) and endogenous transposable elements. APOBEC3G and APOBEC3F interact  with numerous proteins that regulate cellular RNA metabolism, including  components of the RNA-induced silencing complex (RISC), and colocalize with a  subset of these proteins to mRNA processing bodies (P bodies), which are sites  of mRNA translational repression and decay. We sought to determine the role of P  bodies and associated proteins in HIV-1 replication and APOBEC3 antiviral  activity. While we established a positive correlation between APOBEC3 protein  incorporation into virions and localization to P bodies, depletion of the P-body  components DDX6 or Lsm1 did not affect HIV-1 replication, APOBEC3 packaging into  virions or APOBEC3 protein mediated inhibition of HIV-1 infectivity. In  addition, neither HIV-1 genomic RNA nor Gag colocalized with P-body proteins.  However, simultaneous depletion of multiple Argonaute family members, the  effector proteins of RISC, could modestly increase viral infectivity. Because  some APOBEC3 proteins interact with several Argonaute proteins, we also tested  whether they could modulate microRNA (miRNA) activity. We found no evidence for  the specific regulation of miRNA function by the APOBEC3 proteins, though more  general effects on transfected gene expression were observed. In sum, our  results indicate that P bodies and certain associated proteins do not regulate  HIV-1 replication or APOBEC3 protein antiviral activity. Localization to P  bodies may therefore provide a means of sequestering APOBEC3 enzymatic activity  away from cellular DNA or may be linked to as yet unidentified cellular  functions.', 'Previously, we found that treatment of cells with the Hsp90 inhibitor  geldanamycin (GA) leads to a substantial reduction in the number of processing  bodies (P-bodies), and also alters the size and subcellular localization of  stress granules. These findings imply that the chaperone activity of Hsp90 is  involved in the formation of P-bodies and stress granules. To verify these  observations, we examined whether another Hsp90 inhibitor radicicol (RA)  affected P-bodies and stress granules. Treatment with RA reduced the level of  the Hsp90 client protein Argonaute 2 and the number of P-bodies. Although stress  granules still assembled in RA-treated cells upon heat shock, they were smaller  and more dispersed in the cytoplasm than those in untreated cells. Furthermore  eIF4E and eIF4E-transporter were dissociated selectively from stress granules in  RA-treated cells. These observations were comparable to those obtained upon  treatment with GA in our previous work. Thus, we conclude that abrogation of the  chaperone activity of Hsp90 affects P-body formation and the integrity of stress  granules.', 'The localization of mRNA forms a key facet of the post-transcriptional control  of gene expression and recent evidence suggests that it may be considerably more  widespread than previously anticipated.

We also review recent data suggesting  that even where there is a global relocalization of mRNA, the specificity and  kinetics of this process can be regulated.', ""Deadenylation is the major step triggering mammalian mRNA decay. One consequence  of deadenylation is the formation of nontranslatable messenger RNA (mRNA)  protein complexes (messenger ribonucleoproteins [mRNPs]). Nontranslatable mRNPs  may accumulate in P-bodies, which contain factors involved in translation  repression, decapping, and 5'-to-3' degradation. We demonstrate that  deadenylation is required for mammalian P-body formation and mRNA decay. We  identify Pan2, Pan3, and Caf1 deadenylases as new P-body components and show  that Pan3 helps recruit Pan2, Ccr4, and Caf1 to P-bodies. Pan3 knockdown causes  a reduction of P-bodies and has differential effects on mRNA decay. Knocking  down Caf1 or overexpressing a Caf1 catalytically inactive mutant impairs  deadenylation and mRNA decay. P-bodies are not detected when deadenylation is  blocked and are restored when the blockage is released. When deadenylation is  impaired, P-body formation is not restorable, even when mRNAs exit the  translating pool. These results support a dynamic interplay among deadenylation,  mRNP remodeling, and P-body formation in selective decay of mammalian mRNA.""]","Processing bodies (P bodies, PB) are cytoplasmic protein complexes involved in degradation and translational arrest of mRNA."
174,How many tissue kallikrein genes are present in the human genome?,"['Kallikreins belong to a family of serine proteases that are widespread  throughout living organisms, expressed in diverse tissue-specific patterns, and  known to have highly diverse physiological functions. The 15 human and 24 mouse  kallikreins have been implicated in pathophysiology of brain, kidney, and  respiratory and reproductive systems and often are used as cancer biomarkers. To  better elucidate the structure and evolutionary origin of this important gene  family in the pig, we have constructed a contiguous BAC clone-derived physical  map of the porcine kallikrein gene region and have fully sequenced a BAC clone  containing 13 kallikrein genes, 11 of which are novel. Radiation hybrid mapping  assigns this kallikrein-gene-rich region to porcine chromosome 6. Phylogenetic  and percent identity plot-based analyses revealed strong structure and order  conservation of kallikreins among four mammalian species. Reverse  transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction-based expression analysis of porcine  kallikreins showed a complex expression pattern across different tissues with  the thymus being the only tissue expressing all 13 kallikrein genes.

Recently, growing evidence indicates that many kallikrein genes are  involved in malignancy. In rodents, kallikreins are encoded by a large multigene  family, but in humans only three kallikreins were thought to exist. Based on the  homology between the human and rodent kallikrein loci, we studied a 300 kb  region of genomic sequences around the putative KLK1 gene locus on chromosome  19q13.3-q13.4. By using linear sequence information, restriction analysis, end  sequencing, PCR and blotting techniques, as well as bioinformatic approaches, we  were able to construct the first detailed map of the human kallikrein gene  family. Comparative analysis of genes located in this area, provides strong  evidence that the human kallikrein gene family locus on chromosome 19 is  considerably larger than previously thought, containing at least fifteen genes.  We have established, for the first time, the common structural features that  apply to all members of the expanded kallikrein multigene family. Our map  specifies the distance between genes to one base pair accuracy, the relative  location, and the direction of transcription of all 15 genes. Determination of  the true size of the kallikrein family in humans is important for our  understanding of the contribution of the kallikreins to human biology and  pathophysiology.', ""The human kallikrein gene family consists of 15 serine proteases. We examined  the expression of the kallikrein genes in human cerebral cortex and hippocampus  by RT-PCR and compared their expression between Alzheimer's disease (AD) and  control tissue.

KLK9 is expressed in cortex but not  hippocampus, whereas KLK2, 3, 12 and 15 are not expressed in either tissue. We  demonstrate an 11.5-fold increase in KLK8 mRNA levels in AD hippocampus compared  to controls. The KLK8 gene product, neuropsin, processes extracellular matrix  and is important for neuronal plasticity. Therefore, the increase in KLK8 could  have detrimental effects on hippocampal function in AD."", 'Minisatellites are repetitive sequences of DNA that are present throughout the  genome.

We utilized the SAGE and EST databases of the  Cancer Genome Anatomy Project to perform in-silico analysis of kallikrein gene  expression in normal and cancerous pancreatic and colon tissues and cell lines  using virtual Northern blotting (VNB), digital differential display (DDD) and  X-profiler. At least two kallikreins, KLK6 and KLK10, are significantly  up-regulated in pancreatic cancer. We probed 2 normal and 6 pancreatic cancer  SAGE libraries with gene-specific tags for each of these kallikreins. KLK6 was  found to be expressed in 5/6 cancer libraries and showed the most marked  (5-fold) increase in average expression levels in cancer vs. normal. These data  were verified by screening the EST databases, where all mRNA clones isolated  were from cancerous libraries, with no clones detected in normal pancreatic  tissues or cell lines. X-profiler comparison of two pools of normal and  cancerous pancreatic libraries further verified the significant increase of KLK6  expression levels in pancreatic cancer. DDD data showed a 13-fold increase in  KLK10 expression in pancreatic cancer. Three kallikrein genes, KLK6, 8 and 10  are overexpressed in colon cancer compared to normal colon, while one  kallikrein, KLK1, is down-regulated.

KLK10 was not detectable in normal colon.

We used the serial analysis of gene  expression and expressed sequence tag databases of the Cancer Genome Anatomy  Project to perform in silico analyses of the expression pattern of the 15 human  KLK genes in normal and cancerous ovarian tissues and cell lines. We found that  seven KLK genes (KLK5, KLK6, KLK7, KLK8, KLK10, KLK11, and KLK14) are  up-regulated in ovarian cancer. Probing 2 normal and 10 ovarian cancer serial  analysis of gene expression libraries with gene-specific tags for each KLK  indicated that whereas no expression was detected in any normal libraries (with  the exception of KLK10 and KLK11), these KLKs were found to be expressed with  moderate densities (103-408 tags per million) in 40-60% of the ovarian cancer  libraries analyzed. These data were verified by screening the expressed sequence  tag databases, where 78 of 79 mRNA clones isolated for these genes were from  ovarian cancer libraries. X-profiler comparison of the pools of normal and  cancerous ovaries identified a significant difference in expression levels for  six of the seven KLKs. We experimentally verified the overexpression of six KLK  proteins in cancer versus normal or benign tissues with highly sensitive and  specific immunofluorometric assays. A statistically significant stepwise  increase in protein levels was found among normal, benign, and cancerous ovarian  tissues. The expression of five KLKs showed a strong degree of correlation at  the protein level, suggesting the existence of a common mechanism or pathway  that controls the expression of this group of adjacent genes during ovarian  cancer progression.', 'Recent evidence suggests that many members of the human kallikrein gene family  are differentially regulated in breast cancer and other endocrine-related  malignancies. In this study, we utilised the serial analysis of gene expression  (SAGE) and expressed sequence tag (EST) databases of the Cancer Genome Anatomy  Project (CGAP) to perform in silico analyses of the expression pattern of the 15  human kallikrein genes in normal and cancerous breast tissues and cell lines  using different analytical tools such as Virtual Northern blotting, Digital  Differential Display and X-profiler. Our results indicate that at least four  kallikrein genes (KLK5, 6, 8, 10) are downregulated in breast cancer. Probing  eight normal and 24 breast cancer SAGE libraries with gene-specific tags for  each of the above kallikreins indicated moderate-to-high expression densities in  normal breast (27-319 tags per million; tpm, in two to five out of eight  libraries), compared to no or low expression (0 - 34 tpm in zero to two  libraries out of 24) in breast cancer. These data were verified by screening the  EST databases, where all mRNA clones isolated for these genes, except for one in  each, were from normal breast libraries, with no clones detected from breast  cancer tissues or cell lines (with the exception of KLK8). X-profiler comparison  of two pools of normal and breast cancer libraries further verified the presence  of significant downregulation of expression levels of 4 of the kallikreins genes  (KLK5, 6, 10, 12). We experimentally verified the downregulation of these four  kallikreins (KLK5, 6, 8, 10 and 12) by RT - PCR analysis.', 'The tissue kallikrein (KLK) family contains 15 genes (KLK1-KLK15) tandemly  arranged on chromosome 19q13.4 that forms the largest cluster of contiguous  protease genes in the human genome. Here, we provide mechanistic evidence  showing that the expression of KLK13, one of the most recently identified family  members, is significantly up-regulated in metastatic lung adenocarcinoma. Whilst  overexpression of KLK13 resulted in an increase in malignant cell behavior,  knockdown of its endogenous gene expression caused a significant decrease in  cell migratory and invasive properties. Functional studies further demonstrated  that KLK13 is activated via demethylation of its upstream region. The elevated  KLK13 protein then enhances the ability of tumor cells to degrade extracellular  laminin that, subsequently, facilitates cell metastatic potential in the in vivo  SCID mouse xenograft model. KLK13 was also found to induce the expression of  N-cadherin to help promote tumor cell motility. Together, these results reveal  the enhancing effects of KLK13 on tumor cell invasion and migration, and that it  may serve as a diagnostic/prognostic marker and a potential therapeutic target  for lung cancer.']","Tissue kallikreins (KLKs) are a group of closely related serine proteinases that are represented by multigene families in the human genome.

175,Which hormone concentrations are altered in patients with the Allan–Herndon–Dudley syndrome?,"['Mutations of the monocarboxylate transporter 8 gene (MCT8, SLC16A2) cause the  Allan-Herndon-Dudley syndrome, an X-linked syndrome of severe intellectual  deficit and neurological impairment. Mct8 transports thyroid hormones (T4 and  T3), and the Allan-Herndon-Dudley syndrome is likely caused by lack of T3  transport to neurons during critical periods of fetal brain development. To  evaluate the role of Mct8 in thyroid hormone action in the fetal brain we  administered T4 or T3 to thyroidectomized pregnant dams treated with  methyl-mercapto-imidazol to produce maternal and fetal hypothyroidism. Gene  expression was then measured in the fetal cerebral cortex. T4 increased Camk4,  Sema3c, and Slc7a3 expression, but T3 was without effect. To investigate the  cause for the lack of T3 action we analyzed the expression of organic anion  transport polypeptide (Oatp14, Slco1c1), a T4 transporter, and Mct8 (Slc16a2), a  T4 and T3 transporter, by confocal microscopy. Both proteins were present in the  brain capillaries forming the blood-brain barrier and in the epithelial cells of  the choroid plexus forming the blood-cerebrospinal fluid barrier. It is  concluded that T4 from the maternal compartment influences gene expression in  the fetal cerebral cortex, possibly after transport via organic anion  transporter polypeptide and/or Mct8, and conversion to T3 in the astrocytes. On  the other hand, T3 does not reach the target neurons despite the presence of  Mct8. The data indicate that T4, through local deiodination, provides most T3 in  the fetal rat brain. The role of Mct8 as a T3 transporter in the fetal rat brain  is therefore uncertain.', ""Transport of thyroid hormones across the plasma membrane is required for binding  to their nuclear receptors. Monocarboxylate transporter 8 (MCT8) is a plasma  membrane thyroid hormone transport protein, which has recently gained much  attention, since mutations in MCT8 are associated with severe mental retardation  in patients afflicted with the Allan-Herndon-Dudley syndrome. MCT8 is expressed  along the blood-brain-barrier and on central neurons. We have found that  desipramine (DMI), a tricyclic antidepressant, acts as an inhibitor of thyroid  hormone transport by MCT8. Uptake of 3,5,3'-triiodo-L-thyronine (T(3)) into  primary cortical neurons could be blocked with desipramine as well as with the  known, but unspecific, inhibitor bromosulphtalein (BSP). T(3) uptake by neurons  derived from Mct8-deficient cells was not further decreased by DMI. In a  heterologous expression system, both human MCT8 and its close homolog, MCT10,  were sensitive to inhibition by DMI. Kinetic experiments demonstrated a  non-competitive mode of inhibition. Numerous interactions between thyroid  hormones, depressive symptoms, and antidepressant treatments have been reported  in the literature. Our findings add to the evidence that antidepressant drugs  may affect CNS thyroid hormone function."", ""Thyroid hormone transport into cells requires plasma membrane transport  proteins. Mutations in one of these, monocarboxylate transporter 8 (MCT8), have  been identified as underlying cause for the Allan-Herndon-Dudley syndrome, an  X-linked mental retardation in which the patients also present with abnormally  high 3',3,5-triiodothyronine (T(3)) plasma levels. Mice deficient in Mct8  replicate the thyroid hormone abnormalities observed in the human condition.  However, no neurological deficits have been described in mice lacking Mct8.  Therefore, we subjected Mct8-deficient mice to a comprehensive  immunohistochemical, neurological, and behavioral screen. Several behavioral  abnormalities were found in the mutants. Interestingly, some of these behavioral  changes are compatible with hypothyroidism, whereas others rather indicate  hyperthyroidism. We thus hypothesized that neurons exclusively dependent on Mct8  are in a hypothyroid state, whereas neurons expressing other T(3) transporters  become hyperthyroid, if they are exposed directly to the high plasma T(3). The  majority of T(3) uptake in primary cortical neurons is mediated by Mct8, but  pharmacological inhibition suggested functional expression of additional T(3)  transporter classes. mRNAs encoding six T(3) transporters, including L-type  amino acid transporters (LATs), were coexpressed with Mct8 in isolated neurons.  We then demonstrated Lat2 expression in cultured neurons and throughout murine  brain development. In contrast, LAT2 is expressed in microglia in the developing  human brain during gestation, but not in neurons. We suggest that lack of  functional complementation by alternative thyroid hormone transporters in  developing human neurons precipitates the devastating neurodevelopmental  phenotype in MCT8-deficient patients, whereas Mct8-deficient mouse neurons are  functionally complemented by other transporters, for possibly Lat2."", 'The Allan-Herndon-Dudley syndrome (AHDS;MIM 300523) of X-linked mental  retardation and hypotonia is caused by mutations in a thyroid hormone  transporter gene--the monocarboxylate transporter 8 (MCT8 also known as SLC16A2)  gene. A 23-month-old boy with severe developmental delay, hypotonia, recurrent  emesis, and irritability is described. He was diagnosed with hypothyroidism at  the age of 4 months. However, T3 level was elevated. Molecular analysis of the  MCT8 gene detected a single base duplication in exon 5 c.1614dupC (p.Ile539fs),  consistent with a diagnosis of AHDS. While T3 is the best marker for this  disorder, elevations in TSH should alert to the diagnosis.', 'BACKGROUND: Iodothyronines are charged amino acid derivatives that cannot  passively cross a phospholipid bilayer. Transport of thyroid hormones across  plasma membranes is mediated by integral membrane proteins belonging to several  gene families. These transporters therefore allow or limit access of thyroid  hormones into brain. Since thyroid hormones are essential for brain development  and cell differentiation, it is expected that genetic deficiency of such  transporters would result in neurodevelopmental derangements. SCOPE OF REVIEW: We introduce concepts of thyroid hormone transport into the  brain and into brain cells. Important thyroid hormone transmembrane transporters  are presented along with their expression patterns in different brain cell  types. A focus is placed on monocarboxylate transporter 8 (MCT8) which has been  identified as an essential thyroid hormone transporter in humans. Mutations in  MCT8 underlie one of the first described X-linked mental retardation syndromes,  the Allan-Herndon-Dudley syndrome. MAJOR CONCLUSIONS: Thyroid hormone transporter molecules are expressed in a  developmental and cell type-specific pattern. Any thyroid hormone molecule has  to cross consecutively the luminal and abluminal membranes of the capillary  endothelium, enter astrocytic foot processes, and leave the astrocyte through  the plasma membrane to finally cross another plasma membrane on its way towards  its target nucleus. GENERAL SIGNIFICANCE: We can expect more transporters being involved in or  contributing to in neurodevelopmental or neuropsychiatric disease. Due to their  expression in cellular components regulating the hypothalamus-pituitary-thyroid  axis, mutations and polymorphisms are expected to impact on negative feedback  regulation and hormonal setpoints. This article is part of a Special Issue  entitled Thyroid hormone signalling.', 'Monocarboxylate transporter 8 (MCT8 or SLC16A2) is important for the neuronal  uptake of triiodothyronine (T3) in its function as a specific and active  transporter of thyroid hormones across the cell membrane, thus being essential  for human brain development. We report on a German male with  Allan-Herndon-Dudley syndrome presenting with severe intellectual and motor  disability, paroxysmal dyskinesia combined with truncal muscular hypotonia, and  peripheral muscular hypertonia at his current age of 9 years. Additionally, the  patient has a lesion in the left putamen region revealed by magnetic resonance  imaging and elevated serum T3 levels. The male appeared to have a hemizygous  mutation (R271H) in the MCT8 gene that was sequenced directly from genomic DNA  and occurred de novo in the maternal germline, as both his mother and his sister  were not carriers of the mutation. Ruling out a common polymorphism, 50 normal  individuals of the same ethnic background did not harbour the mutation. The  identified MCT8 gene mutation (R271H) is very likely to be the genetic cause for  neuronal hypothyroidism despite elevated serum T3 levels.', 'Allan-Herndon-Dudley syndrome (AHDS) is a severe psychomotor retardation  characterized by neurological impairment and abnormal thyroid hormone (TH)  levels. Mutations in the TH transporter, monocarboxylate transporter 8 (MCT8),  are associated with AHDS. MCT8 knock-out mice exhibit impaired TH levels;  however, they lack neurological defects. Here, the zebrafish mct8 gene and  promoter were isolated, and mct8 promoter-driven transgenic lines were used to  show that, similar to humans, mct8 is primarily expressed in the nervous and  vascular systems. Morpholino-based knockdown and rescue experiments revealed  that MCT8 is strictly required for neural development in the brain and spinal  cord. This study shows that MCT8 is a crucial regulator during embryonic  development and establishes the first vertebrate model for MCT8 deficiency that  exhibits a neurological phenotype.', 'PURPOSE OF REVIEW: To discuss the recent advances on thyroid hormone transport  in the brain. A special attention is paid to the X-linked thyroid hormone cell  transport (THCT) defect (also known as the Allan-Herndon-Dudley syndrome),  caused by mutations of the specific thyroid hormone transporter MCT8 gene. RECENT FINDINGS: MCT8 is involved in thyroid hormone transport in the brain. MRI  of patients with THCT defect showed myelination delays, probably related to  impaired thyroid hormone action on oligodendrocytes. MCT8 is also expressed in  the thyroid and has an important role in thyroid hormone secretion. The altered  circulating concentrations of thyroid hormone in the patients are partly because  of impaired secretion and altered peripheral metabolism. Increased deiodinase  activity is important in the pathophysiology of the syndrome. High D1 activity  in liver and kidney increases T4 and rT3 deiodination, and contributes to the  increased serum T3. High D2 activity in the brain contributes to compensate the  deficient T3 transport by increasing local T3 production. SUMMARY: Patients with suspected X-linked leukoencephalopathy should be screened  for MCT8 gene mutations. Research on the brain pathophysiology of the THCT  defect should focus on the specific role of Mct8 on oligodendrocytes and  myelination.', 'BACKGROUND: Current data suggest that excessive androgen exposure can lead to  the development of polycystic ovaries and polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS).  Anti-Müllerian hormone (AMH) levels reflect the number of small antral follicles  in the ovaries and are elevated in PCOS. We hypothesized that protracted  reduction of circulating androgens and/or insulin resistance would reduce  circulating AMH concentrations in women with PCOS. METHODS: A prospective, randomized, double-blind 26 week long study was  undertaken in 50 women with PCOS. They all received diet and lifestyle  counselling, and metformin 850 mg three times daily. Concomitantly, they were  randomized to either dexamethasone 0.25 mg daily (n = 25) or placebo (n = 25).  Thirty-eight women completed the study. AMH (primary outcome) and other hormone  levels were measured at inclusion and after 8 and 26 weeks of treatment. RESULTS: At baseline in univariate regression analyses, AMH levels associated  positively with testosterone levels (P = 0.041) and ovarian volume (P = 0.002).  In multivariate regression analyses, AMH associated positively with testosterone  P = 0.004), and negatively with dehydroepiandrosterone sulphate (DHEAS) (P =  0.001) and C-peptide levels (P = 0.020). Circulating AMH concentrations were  unaffected by 6 months of lifestyle counselling with metformin and placebo  treatment. AMH levels were also unaffected by 6 months of androgen suppression  with dexamethasone in addition. CONCLUSIONS: AMH levels in untreated PCOS women associated positively with  testosterone, and negatively with DHEAS and C-peptide levels. Six months of  androgen suppression by either metformin or low-dose dexamethasone treatment  failed to influence circulating AMH levels.', 'BACKGROUND: Dysregulation of the vasopressin (AVP) system has been implicated in  the pathogenesis of autistic spectrum disorder (ASD). Apelin is a recently  discovered neuropeptide that could counteract AVP actions and whose receptors  are colocalized with vasopressin in hypothalamic magnocellular neurons. Aims of  the present study were to investigate circulating levels of apelin in patients  with ASD and to assess their correlation with plasma AVP concentrations. METHODS: Plasma levels of apelin and AVP were measured in a total of 18 patients  with ASD and 21 age- and gender-matched healthy comparison subjects. The  Childhood Autism Rating Scale (CARS) was used to assess the severity of autistic  symptoms. RESULTS: Significantly reduced levels of apelin (p < 0.001) and elevated  concentrations of AVP (p = 0.02) were found in ASD patients as compared to  controls. Additionally, a significant inverse correlation between apelin and AVP  levels was found within the ASD group (r = -0.61; p = 0.007), but not in healthy  participants (r = -0.26; p = 0.25). Multivariate linear regression analysis  showed that only AVP concentrations independently predicted apelin values in ASD  individuals (beta = -0.42, t = 2.63, p = 0.014). No correlation was seen between  apelin levels and CARS scores (r = -0.10; p = 0.68). CONCLUSIONS: Our findings of a significantly reduced peripheral level of apelin  coupled with elevated AVP point to a subtle but definite vasopressinergic  dysfunction in autism that could play a role in the etiopathophysiology of this  disorder in humans.']","Thyroid hormone concentrations are altered in patients with the Allan-Herndon-Dudley syndrome.

176,Is bapineuzumab effective for treatment of patients with Alzheimer's disease?,"[""The exact mechanisms leading to Alzheimer's disease (AD) are largely unknown,  limiting the identification of effective disease-modifying therapies. The two  principal neuropathological hallmarks of AD are extracellular β-amyloid (Aβ),  peptide deposition (senile plaques) and intracellular neurofibrillary tangles  containing hyperphosphorylated tau protein. During the last decade, most of the  efforts of the pharmaceutical industry were directed against the production and  accumulation of Aβ. The most innovative of the pharmacological approaches was  the stimulation of Aβ clearance from the brain of AD patients via the  administration of Aβ antigens (active vaccination) or anti-Aβ antibodies  (passive vaccination). Several active and passive anti-Aβ vaccines are under  clinical investigation. Unfortunately, the first active vaccine (AN1792,  consisting of preaggregate Aβ and an immune adjuvant, QS-21) was abandoned  because it caused meningoencephalitis in approximately 6% of treated patients.  Anti-Aβ monoclonal antibodies (bapineuzumab and solanezumab) are now being  developed. The clinical results of the initial studies with bapineuzumab were  equivocal in terms of cognitive benefit. The occurrence of vasogenic edema after  bapineuzumab, and more rarely brain microhemorrhages (especially in Apo E ε4  carriers), has raised concerns on the safety of these antibodies directed  against the N-terminus of the Aβ peptide. Solanezumab, a humanized anti-Aβ  monoclonal antibody directed against the midregion of the Aβ peptide, was shown  to neutralize soluble Aβ species. Phase II studies showed a good safety profile  of solanezumab, while studies on cerebrospinal and plasma biomarkers documented  good signals of pharmacodynamic activity. Although some studies suggested that  active immunization may be effective against tau in animal models of AD, very  few studies regarding passive immunization against tau protein are currently  available. The results of the large, ongoing Phase III trials with bapineuzumab  and solanezumab will tell us if monoclonal anti-Aβ antibodies may slow down the  rate of deterioration of AD. Based on the new diagnostic criteria of AD and on  recent major failures of anti-Aβ drugs in mild-to-moderate AD patients, one  could argue that clinical trials on potential disease-modifying drugs, including  immunological approaches, should be performed in the early stages of AD."", ""Alzheimer's disease (AD) is the most common neurodegenerative disorder.  Currently available therapies are symptomatic but do not alter underlying  disease progression. Immunotherapeutic approaches such as anti Aβ peptide active  vaccination trials have had limited success to date. Intravenous immunoblobulin  (IVIg) is widely used in immune-mediated neurological disorders such myasthenia  gravis and Guillain-Barre syndrome. These preparations have been obtained from  the pooled plasma of healthy human donors and contain natural anti-amyloid  antibodies and are well tolerated. A small pilot study of passive immunotherapy  using IVIg has suggested cognitive improvement. A multicenter phase III trial is  ongoing and will determine whether or not this treatment can ameliorate  cognitive deficits in mild-to-moderate AD. Here, we briefly review the  pathogenic role of amyloid and tau in AD, as well as immunotherapeutic efforts  to date. We also summarize what is known about naturally occurring anti-Aβ and  tau antibodies in IVIg with a view toward explaining potential mechanisms  underlying their therapeutic effects."", 'Coincident with the expanding population of aged people, the incidence of  Alzheimer disease (AD) is rapidly increasing in most advanced countries. At  present, no effective prophylactics are available. Among several pathological  mechanisms proposed for AD, the ""amyloid hypothesis"" has been most widely  accepted, in which accumulation or deposition of Aβ is considered to be the  initial event. Thus, prevention of Aβ production would be an ideal strategy for  the treatment or prevention of AD. Aβ is produced via the proteolytic cleavage  of its precursor protein, APP (amyloid precursor protein), by two different  enzymes, β and γ-secretases. Indeed, inhibitors against either or both enzymes  have been developed and tested for clinical efficacy. Based on the ""amyloid  hypothesis"", we developed a luciferase-based screening method to monitor  γ-secretase activity, screened more than 1,600 plant extracts, most of which  have long been used in Chinese medicine, and observed that Hop extracts  significantly inhibit Aβ production in cultured cells. A major component of the  inhibitory activity was purified, and its chemical identity was determined by  NMR to be Garcinielliptone HC. In vivo, oral administration of Hop extracts to  AD model mice decreased Aβ depositions in the cerebral cortex of the parietal  lobe, hippocampus, and artery walls (amyloid angiopathy) in the brains. In a  Morris water maze test, AD model mice that had daily consumed Hop extracts in  their drinking water showed significant mitigation of memory impairment at ages  of 9 and 12 months. Moreover, in the open field test oral administration of Hop  extracts also prevented an emotional disturbance that appeared in the AD mice at  18 months. Despite lifelong consumption of Hop extracts, no deleterious side  effects were observed at any age. These results support the ""amyloid  hypothesis"", and indicate that Hop extract is a promising candidate for an  effective prophylactic for AD.', ""The lack of progress in the development of disease-modifying therapy in  Alzheimer's disease (AD) was highlighted recently by the cessation of a phase 3  clinical trial studying the effects of bapineuzumab on mild to moderate disease.  No treatment benefit was apparent, whereas several serious side effects occurred  more commonly in the treatment group compared to placebo. This is the latest  failure in a now long list of trials targeting lesional proteins believed to be  fundamental drivers of the disease process. As the focus of the trial is  directly tied to ostensible disease pathogenesis, objectivity compels us yet  again to re-examine the amyloid cascade hypothesis as even a marginally  significant pathogenic mediator of disease and to perhaps revert back to  traditional science where repeated negative data leads one to consider other  ideas. In the case of AD, amyloid-β metabolism and tau phosphorylation have been  exhaustively studied, both to no avail. Oxidative stress has similarly been  examined in detail by multiple mechanisms and targeted for treatment with a  similar result. An appeal to the scientific community may be made to consider  lesions in a different light. Have we been seduced by so-called hallmark lesions  into believing that they are responsible for disease when in fact the reverse is  true, and will we genuinely consider a systems biology approach to AD or instead  continue on the path of the lesion, which has so far followed a flat line of  progress?"", ""Drugs currently used to treat Alzheimer's Disease (AD) have limited therapeutic  value and do not affect the main neuropathological hallmarks of the disease,  i.e., senile plaques and neurofibrillar tangles. Senile plaques are mainly  formed of beta-amyloid (Abeta), a 42-aminoacid peptide. Neurofibrillar tangles  are composed of paired helical filaments of hyperphosphorylated tau protein.  New, potentially disease-modifying, therapeutic approaches are targeting Abeta  and tau protein. Drugs directed against Abeta include active and passive  immunization, that have been found to accelerate Abeta clearance from the brain.  The most developmentally advanced monoclonal antibody directly targeting Abeta  is bapineuzumab, now being studied in a large Phase III clinical trial.  Compounds that interfere with proteases regulating Abeta formation from amyloid  precursor protein (APP) are also actively pursued. The discovery of inhibitors  of beta-secretase, the enzyme that regulates the first step of the amyloidogenic  metabolism of APP, has been revealed to be particularly difficult due to  inherent medicinal chemistry problems, and only one compound (CTS-21166) has  reached clinical testing. Conversely, several compounds that inhibit  gamma-secretase, the pivotal enzyme that generates Abeta, have been identified,  the most advanced being LY-450139 (semagacestat), now in Phase III clinical  development. Compounds that stimulate alpha-secretase, the enzyme responsible  for the non-amyloidogenic metabolism of APP, are also being developed, and one  of them, EHT-0202, has recently entered Phase II testing. Potent inhibitors of  Abeta aggregation have also been identified, and one of such compounds, PBT-2,  has provided encouraging neuropsychological results in a recently completed  Phase II study. Therapeutic approaches directed against tau protein include  inhibitors of glycogen synthase kinase- 3 (GSK-3), the enzyme responsible for  tau phosphorylation and tau protein aggregation inhibitors. NP-12, a promising  GSK-3 inhibitor, is being tested in a Phase II study, and methylthioninium  chloride, a tau protein aggregation inhibitor, has given initial encouraging  results in a 50-week study. With all these approaches on their way, the hope for  disease-modifying therapy in this devastating disease may become a reality in  the next 5 years."", ""The characteristic neuropathological changes associated with Alzheimer's disease  (AD) and other lines of evidence support the amyloid cascade hypothesis. Viewing  amyloid deposits as the prime instigator of dementia has now led to clinical  trials of multiple strategies to remove or prevent their formation. We performed  neuropathological and biochemical assessments of 3 subjects treated with  bapineuzumab infusions. Histological analyses were conducted to quantify amyloid  plaque densities, Braak stages and the extent of cerebral amyloid angiopathy  (CAA). Amyloid-β (Aβ) species in frontal and temporal lobe samples were  quantified by ELISA. Western blots of amyloid-β precursor protein (AβPP) and its  C-terminal (CT) fragments as well as tau species were performed.  Bapineuzumab-treated (Bapi-AD) subjects were compared to non-immunized  age-matched subjects with AD (NI-AD) and non-demented control (NDC) cases. Our  study revealed that Bapi-AD subjects exhibited overall amyloid plaque densities  similar to those of NI-AD cases. In addition, CAA was moderate to severe in  NI-AD and Bapi-AD patients. Although histologically-demonstrable leptomeningeal,  cerebrovascular and neuroparenchymal-amyloid densities all appeared unaffected  by treatment, Aβ peptide profiles were significantly altered in Bapi-AD  subjects. There was a trend for reduction in total Aβ42 levels as well as an  increase in Aβ40 which led to a corresponding significant decrease in Aβ42:Aβ40  ratio in comparison to NI-AD subjects. There were no differences in the levels  of AβPP, CT99 and CT83 or tau species between Bapi-AD and NI-AD subjects. The  remarkable alteration in Aβ profiles reveals a dynamic amyloid production in  which removal and depositional processes were apparently perturbed by  bapineuzumab therapy. Despite the alteration in biochemical composition, all 3  immunized subjects exhibited continued cognitive decline."", ""In the past decade, Alzheimer's disease drug discovery has been directed at  'disease modifying drugs' that are able to counteract the progression of  Alzheimer's disease by intervening in specific parts of its neuropathological  process. Passive immunization with monoclonal antibodies (mAbs) may be able to  clear toxic amyloid-β species either directly or through microglia or complement  activation, thereby halting the amyloid cascade and preventing neurodegeneration  and cognitive and functional decline. Thus far, results from two large phase 3  trial programs with bapineuzumab and solaneuzumab, respectively, have brought  rather disappointing results. Possible explanations could be that these  compounds were either targeting the wrong amyloid-β species, or were given too  late in the disease process. Several new mAbs targeting various amyloid-β  epitopes are now being tested in ongoing phase 2 and 3 clinical trials. The  present review discusses the various mAbs aimed at amyloid-β, summarizes trial  results and provides an outlook for the future."", ""An international task force of investigators from academia, industry, nonprofit  foundations, and regulatory agencies met in Monte Carlo, Monaco, on October 31,  2012, to review lessons learned from the recent bapineuzumab and solanezumab  trials, and to incorporate insights gained from these trials into future  clinical studies. Although there is broad consensus that Alzheimer's disease  (AD) should be treated during its earliest stages, the concept of secondary  prevention has evolved to be described more accurately as treatment of  preclinical, presymptomatic, or early AD. There continues to be a strong  emphasis on biomarkers and a need for new biomarkers; however, there has also  been a realization, based on completed trials, that the most reliable indicator  of clinical efficacy across the entire spectrum of disease from asymptomatic to  AD dementia is likely a measure of cognition. The task force made many  recommendations that should improve the likelihood of success in future trials,  including larger phase 2 or combined phase 2/phase 3 studies, clear evidence of  target engagement in the central nervous system, evidence of downstream effects  on biomarkers before initiating phase 3 studies, consideration of adaptive and  targeted trial designs, and use of sensitive measures of cognition as the most  robust indicator of treatment benefit."", ""BACKGROUND: Carbon-11-labelled Pittsburgh compound B ((11)C-PiB) PET is a marker  of cortical fibrillar amyloid-beta load in vivo. We used (11)C-PiB PET to  investigate whether bapineuzumab, a humanised anti-amyloid-beta monoclonal  antibody, would reduce cortical fibrillar amyloid-beta load in patients with  Alzheimer's disease. METHODS: Patients with mild-to-moderate Alzheimer's disease were randomly  assigned to receive intravenous bapineuzumab or placebo in a ratio of seven to  three in three ascending dose groups (0.5, 1.0, or 2.0 mg/kg). Each dose group  was enrolled after safety review of the previous group. Randomisation was by  interactive voice response system; masking was achieved with numbered kit  allocation. Patients, investigators, study site personnel, sponsor staff, and  carers were masked to treatment. Patients received up to six infusions, 13 weeks  apart, and had (11)C-PiB PET scans at baseline and at weeks 20, 45, and 78. The  primary outcome was the difference between the pooled bapineuzumab group and the  pooled placebo group in mean change from screening to week 78 in (11)C-PiB  cortical to cerebellar retention ratio averaged across six cortical regions of  interest. Analysis was by modified intention to treat. This study is registered  with EudraCT, number 2004-004120-12; ISRCTN17517446. FINDINGS: 28 patients were assigned to bapineuzumab (n=20) or placebo (n=8). 19  patients in the bapineuzumab group and seven in the placebo group were included  in the modified intention-to-treat analysis. Estimated mean (11)C-PiB retention  ratio change from baseline to week 78 was -0.09 (95% CI -0.16 to -0.02; p=0.014)  in the bapineuzumab group and 0.15 (95% CI 0.02 to 0.28; p=0.022) in the placebo  group. Estimated mean difference in (11)C-PiB retention ratio change from  baseline to week 78 between the bapineuzumab group and the placebo group was  -0.24 (95% CI -0.39 to -0.09; p=0.003). Differences between the bapineuzumab  group and the placebo group in the individual regions of interest were similar  to the overall mean difference. Adverse events were typically mild to moderate  in severity and transient. Two patients in the 2.0 mg/kg bapineuzumab group had  transient cerebral vasogenic oedema. INTERPRETATION: Treatment with bapineuzumab for 78 weeks reduced cortical  (11)C-PiB retention compared with both baseline and placebo.

The article also provides a discussion of  the early trials of AN1792 and an overview of the immunotherapies currently in  development. The authors provide the reader with a critical appraisal of the  to-date clinical trial data on solanezumab and its implications for the broader  field of immunotherapies for AD. EXPERT OPINION: Solanezumab can neutralize soluble Aβ peptides, which may  represent the more neurotoxic of the Aβ species. Phase II findings support the  compound's safety, which has been a concern for some Aβ immunotherapies.  Cerebrospinal and plasma biomarker changes with solanezumab treatment are  encouraging. Results of the ongoing Phase III trials will be instrumental in  determining the drug's clinical significance.""]","Clinical trials have demonstrated that bapineuzumab, a humanized monoclonal antibody against the end terminus of amyloid plaques, is not effective for treatment of patients with Alzheimer's disease. The burden of beta amyloid plaques was reduced in response to bapineuzumab therapy. However, bapineuzumab therapy did not improve cognitive functioning and was associated with significant adverse effects in Alzheimer's disease patients."

An almost complete recovery was  achieved by treatment with betaine.', 'Methylenetetrahydrofolate reductase (MTHFR) synthesizes  5-methyltetrahydrofolate, a major methyl donor for homocysteine remethylation to  methionine. Severe MTHFR deficiency results in marked hyperhomocysteinemia and  homocystinuria. Patients display developmental delay and a variety of  neurological and vascular symptoms. Cloning of the human cDNA and gene has  enabled the identification of 29 rare mutations in homocystinuric patients and  two common variants [677C>T (A222V) and 1298A>C (E429A)] with mild enzymatic  deficiency. Homozygosity for 677C>T or combined heterozygosity for both  polymorphisms is associated with mild hyperhomocysteinemia. In this  communication, we describe four novel mutations in patients with homocystinuria:  two missense mutations (471C>G, I153M; 1025T>C, M338T), a nonsense mutation  (1274G>A, W421X), and a 2-bp deletion (1553delAG). We expressed the 1025T>C  mutation as well as two previously reported amino acid substitutions [983A>G  (N324S) and 1027T>G (W339G)] and observed decreased enzyme activity at 10%, 36%,  and 21% of control levels, respectively, with little or no effect on affinity  for 5-methyltetrahydrofolate. One of these mutations, 983A>G (N324S), showed  flavin adenine dinucleotide (FAD) responsiveness in vitro. Expression of these  mutations in cis with the 677C>T polymorphism, as observed in the patients,  resulted in an additional 50% decrease in enzyme activity.

We investigated whether the MTHFR C677T and  A1298C polymorphisms contribute to hyperhomocysteinemia and increase the risk  factor for stroke. METHODS: A total of 203 acute stroke patients and 55 controls were recruited.  Polymorphisms were determined by using polymerase chain reaction-restriction  fragment length polymorphism (RFLP) and plasma total homocysteine levels were  measured by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA). RESULTS AND CONCLUSIONS: There were no significant differences between C677T and  A1298C genotypes and allele frequencies in the stroke patients and controls.  Total plasma homocysteine level was higher in the 677TT and 1298AA genotypes in  stroke patients and especially small-vessel disease patient subgroup. Age,  number of males, systolic-diastolic blood pressures, creatinine, vitamin B(12)  and homocysteine levels were significantly high among stroke patients. Age, sex,  systolic blood pressure and HDL-C were determined as risk factors for  homocysteine levels. We also determined that the effect of A1298C polymorphism  on homocysteine was not as high as that of C677T polymorphism in acute stroke  patients.

A 35-year-old male with Marfan-like phenotype  complained of a progressive increase of myopia during the previous 2\xa0years.  Ophthalmologic exploration showed a bilateral subluxation of the lens with  inferior and nasal displacement. Biochemical study detected a profile of  increased amino acid levels (homocysteinemia) consistent with suspected  homocystinuria. Vascular and skeletal studies ruled out Marfan syndrome.  Response to treatment demonstrated B(6)-non-responsive homocystinuria. Molecular  study showed compound heterozygous T353\xa0N and D444\xa0N mutations of the  cystathionine beta-synthase (CBS) gene, and also a C667T homozygous mutation of  the methylenetetrahydrofolate-reductase (MTHFR) gene. Family study showed  classical homocystinuria in his father and sister, although they did not present  any systemic or ocular features of the disease. Homocystinuria is a metabolic  disease usually presenting at an early age as vascular, skeletal and  neuropsychiatric abnormalities, as well as ectopia lentis. Our case is atypical  because of the absence of thromboembolism and the mild phenotype, in spite of  being B(6)-non-responsive, and the association of a rare compound heterozygous  mutation of the CBS gene and also an homozygous mutation of the MTHFR gene.

Here we present the clinical course, biochemical and genetic  characteristics of schizophrenia resulted from MTHFR deficiency in a school-age  boy. He was 13 years old. He was admitted with a two-year history of fear,  auditory hallucination, learning difficulty, sleeping problems, irascibility,  drowsing and giggling. At admission, he had significantly elevated plasma and  urine levels of total homocysteine, significantly decreased levels of folate in  serum and cerebrospinal fluid, and a normal blood concentration of methionine.  Further DNA sequencing analysis showed 665C>T homozygous mutations in the MTHFR  gene.

After the treatment for 1 week, his plasma and urine levels of  homocysteine were decreased to a normal range and the clinical symptoms were  significantly improved. After 3 months of treatment, the patient returned to  school. He is now living with normal school life. In summary, children with  late-onset MTHFR deficiency and secondary cerebral folate deficiency may lead to  schizophrenia.

178,What are the main benefits of pharmacophore models?,"['Among the different mammalian isoforms of Carbonic Anhydrase, the hCA VII is  mainly expressed in the brain where it is involved in several neurological  diseases. Thereby hCA VII has been validated as an attractive target for the  discovery of selective inhibitors for the treatment of epilepsy and neurological  pain. To identify new chemical entities as carbonic anhydrase inhibitors (CAIs)  targeting hCA VII, we used a structure-based approach. By means of LigandScout  software we built pharmacophore models from crystal structures of two well-known  CAIs in complex with hCA VII. A merged pharmacophore hypothesis has been  obtained. Subsequently, a focused library of compounds was screened against  pharmacophore model and the most interesting hits were docked into the crystal  structure of hCA VII. As a result, we identified new compounds displaying  significant CA inhibitory effects in the nanomolar range.', 'Febrifugine and its derivatives are effective against Plasmodium falciparum.  Using PHASE algorithm, a five-point pharmacophore model with two hydrogen bond  acceptor (A), one positively ionizable (P) and two aromatic rings (R), was  developed to derive a predictive ligand-based statistically significant  3D-quantitative structure-activity relationship (QSAR) model (r(2) = 0.972, SD =  0.3, F = 173.4, Q(2) = 0.712, RMSE = 0.3, Person-R = 0.94, and r(2) pred = 0.8)  to explicate the structural attributes crucial for antimalarial activity. The  developed pharmacophore model and 3D QSAR model can be a substantial tool for  virtual screening and related antimalarial drug discovery research.', 'In this paper, a new approach for generating receptor-based 3D pharmacophore  models for rapid in silico virtual screening is presented. The method combines  information from docking poses of known ligands of different structures and  further ligand-receptor complexes analyses using structural interaction  fingerprints (SIFts). Next, the best linear combination of three-, four-, and  five-feature pharmacophores in terms of selected performance parameter (i.e.,  recall, F-score, and MCC) is constructed. The resultant queries showed  significantly better VS performance and new scaffold recognition when compared  with the known ligand- and receptor-based pharmacophore models. The approach was  developed and validated on 5-HT₇ receptor homology models created on available  crystal structure templates. The efficiency of the obtained linear combinations  exhibited only a minor dependence on the template selection.', 'The release of arachidonic acid, a precursor in the production of prostaglandins  and leukotrienes, is achieved by activity of the cytosolic phospholipase A(2)α  (cPLA(2)α).

Investigations concerning the molecular mechanism of RNAP inhibition  reveal that they prevent the protein-protein interaction (PPI) between σ(70) and  the RNAP core enzyme. Besides of reducing RNA formation, the inhibitors were  shown to interfere with bacterial lipid biosynthesis. The compounds were active  against Gram-positive pathogens and revealed significantly lower resistance  frequencies compared to clinically used rifampicin.', 'Protein:protein interactions are becoming increasingly significant as potential  drug targets; however, the rational identification of small molecule inhibitors  of such interactions remains a challenge.

However, the  application of pharmacophore modelling in the field of protein:protein  interaction inhibitors has historically been considered more of a challenge and  remains limited. In this review, we explore the interaction mimicry by known  inhibitors that originate from in vitro screening, demonstrating the validity of  pharmacophore mapping in the generation of queries for virtual screening. We  discuss the pharmacophore mapping methods that have been successfully employed  in the discovery of first-in-class inhibitors.

The  best quantitative pharmacophore model, Hypo1, which has the highest correlation  coefficient (0.97), consists of two hydrogen-bond acceptors, one hydrophobic  feature and one ring aromatic feature.

Both the best pharmacophore model for selective AT1 antagonists  (Hypo-AT(1)-7) and ETA antagonists (Hypo-ET(A)-1) were obtained through a  careful validation process. All five features contained in Hypo-AT(1)-7 and  Hypo-ET(A)-1 (hydrogen-bond acceptor (A), hydrophobic aliphatic (Z), negative  ionizable (N), ring aromatic (R), and hydrophobic aromatic (Y)) seem to be  essential for antagonists in terms of binding activity.

Genetic Algorithm Similarity Program (GASP)  was used to derive a 3D pharmacophore model which was used in effective  alignment of data set. Eight molecules were selected on the basis of structure  diversity to build 10 different pharmacophore models. Model 1 was considered as  the best model as it has highest fitness score compared to other nine models.  The obtained model contained two acceptor sites, two donor atoms and one  hydrophobic region. Pharmacophore modeling was followed by substructure  searching and virtual screening. The best CoMFA model, representing steric and  electrostatic fields, obtained for 30 training set molecules was statistically  significant with cross-validated coefficient (q(2)) of 0.673 and conventional  coefficient (r(2)) of 0.988.

However, crystal structures for these targets may be impossible to resolve, posing great challenges in rational drug design. Structure-based virtual screening is not an option when the active site geometry is unknown, but assaying an entire library for hits is an inefficient and expensive proposition.
Pharmacophore modeling solves this problem by determining the spatial arrangement of chemical features that confer drug activity toward a target receptor. Having established the chemical space occupied by active ligands, pharmacophore modeling software allows researchers to create 3-D structure-activity relationships, screen databases, and generate hits without the benefit of a receptor structure."
179,Which species may be used for the biotechnological production of itaconic acid?,"['Fermentation products of Aspergillus terreus ATCC 20542 (a parent strain for  lovastatin production) were collected, and the coexistence of itaconic acid (IA)  with lovastatin was confirmed in this study. Using a lactose-based medium (LBM),  lovastatin production was 873 mg/l on day 10, but IA production was only 22-28  mg/l during the cultures. When lactose in LBM was simply replaced with glucose,  IA production was markedly enhanced by 20-fold (491 mg/l on day 5), which showed  a growth-associated pattern. The findings indicated that the carbon source used  (glucose or lactose) controlled the biosynthetic pathway. The net yield of  lovastatin production when using lactose was calculated to be 25.1 mg/g  (5.1-fold) in comparison with when using glucose in the cultures. Furthermore,  lovastatin production was further increased by 9.2% when IA (0.5 g/l) was added  to LBM. When IA was added at 5 g/l, the fermentation broth turned dark-brown,  and lovastatin production was reduced by 18.0%. Hence, these two metabolites (IA  and lovastatin) produced by the fungus might be related.', 'Aspergillus terreus is successfully used for industrial production of itaconic  acid. The acid is formed from cis-aconitate, an intermediate of the  tricarboxylic (TCA) cycle, by catalytic action of cis-aconitate decarboxylase.  It could be assumed that strong anaplerotic reactions that replenish the pool of  the TCA cycle intermediates would enhance the synthesis and excretion rate of  itaconic acid. In the phylogenetic close relative Aspergillus niger, upregulated  metabolic flux through glycolysis has been described that acted as a strong  anaplerotic reaction. Deregulated glycolytic flux was caused by  posttranslational modification of 6-phosphofructo-1-kinase (PFK1) that resulted  in formation of a highly active, citrate inhibition-resistant shorter form of  the enzyme. In order to avoid complex posttranslational modification, the native  A. niger pfkA gene has been modified to encode for an active shorter PFK1  fragment. By the insertion of the modified A. niger pfkA genes into the A.  terreus strain, increased specific productivities of itaconic acid and final  yields were documented by transformants in respect to the parental strain. On  the other hand, growth rate of all transformants remained suppressed which is  due to the low initial pH value of the medium, one of the prerequisites for the  accumulation of itaconic acid by A. terreus mycelium.', 'Several Aspergillus species are well-known for the production of a variety of  organic acids. In this study, a cloned based transcriptomics approach was used  to identify genes crucial in the biosynthesis pathway for one of these acids,  itaconic acid. From a number of different Aspergillus terreus controlled batch  fermentations, those cultures with the largest difference in itaconic acid titer  and productivity were selected for mRNA isolation. cDNAs derived from these mRNA  samples were used for subsequent hybridization of glass slide arrays based on a  collection of 5000 cDNA clones. A selection of 13 cDNA clones resulting in the  strongest (>10-fold) differential hybridization signals were identified and  subsequently the inserts of these clones were sequenced. Sequence analysis  revealed the presence of in total five different gene inserts among the  sequenced clones. From one of these sequences, encoding a gene of the MmgE-PrpD  family, the full length coding region was shown to encode one of the crucial  itaconic acid pathway enzymes cis-aconitate decarboxylase, by heterologous  expression in Escherichia coli. Expression of this gene in Aspergillus niger,  which is a natural citric acid producer, resulted in itaconate production.  Genome analysis suggests that in A. terreus the cis-aconitate decarboxylase gene  is part of an itaconate acid related gene cluster including genes encoding two  pathway specific transporters and a Zinc finger protein. Interestingly, this  cluster is directly linked to the large lovastatin gene cluster.', 'Sago starch was hydrolyzed using either chemical agents, or enzymes at various  pH and concentrations. Hydrolysis using 5000 AUN/ml (0.5%, w/v) glucoamylase  exhibited the highest itaconic acid yield up to 0.36 g/g sago starch, whereas  hydrolysis using nitric acid at pH 2.0 yielded 0.35 g/g sago starch. The medium  was optimized and the composition was (g/l) 140 sago starch, 1.8 corn steep  liquor, 1.2 MgSO(4).7H(2)O and 2.9 NH(4)NO(3). When the optimal conditions of  hydrolysis and medium composition were applied to itaconic acid production in a  3-l jar fermentor, the itaconic acid production was 48.2 g/l with a yield of  0.34 g/g sago starch. This was filtered from the cultured broth and 37.1g of  itaconic acid was recovered with a purity of 97.2%. This result showed that sago  starch could be converted to a value-added product with only a simple  pretreatment.', 'Biotechnologically produced itaconic acid (IA) is a promising organic acid with  a wide range of applications and the potential to open up new application fields  in the area of polymer chemistry, pharmacy, and agriculture. In this study, a  systematic process optimization was performed with an own isolated strain of  Aspergillus terreus and transferred from a 250-mL to a 15-L scale. An IA  concentration of 86.2\xa0g/L was achieved within 7\xa0days with an overall  productivity of 0.51\xa0g/(L\xa0h), a maximum productivity of 1.2\xa0g/(L\xa0h), and a yield  of 86\xa0mol%. A cultivation of other well-known A. terreus strains with the  developed process showed no significant differences. Based on this, a process is  developed providing a high final IA concentration independent of the used strain  combined with high reproducibility.', 'Strains belonging to the yeast species Kluyveromyces marxianus have been  isolated from a great variety of habitats, which results in a high metabolic  diversity and a substantial degree of intraspecific polymorphism. As a  consequence, several different biotechnological applications have been  investigated with this yeast: production of enzymes (beta-galactosidase,  beta-glucosidase, inulinase, and polygalacturonases, among others), of  single-cell protein, of aroma compounds, and of ethanol (including  high-temperature and simultaneous saccharification-fermentation processes);  reduction of lactose content in food products; production of bioingredients from  cheese-whey; bioremediation; as an anticholesterolemic agent; and as a host for  heterologous protein production. Compared to its congener and model organism,  Kluyveromyces lactis, the accumulated knowledge on K. marxianus is much smaller  and spread over a number of different strains. Although there is no publicly  available genome sequence for this species, 20% of the CBS 712 strain genome was  randomly sequenced (Llorente et al. in FEBS Lett 487:71-75, 2000). In spite of  these facts, K. marxianus can envisage a great biotechnological future because  of some of its qualities, such as a broad substrate spectrum, thermotolerance,  high growth rates, and less tendency to ferment when exposed to sugar excess,  when compared to K. lactis. To increase our knowledge on the biology of this  species and to enable the potential applications to be converted into industrial  practice, a more systematic approach, including the careful choice of (a)  reference strain(s) by the scientific community, would certainly be of great  value.', 'Approximately 1 million tons of Agave tequilana plants are processed annually by  the Mexican Tequila industry generating vast amounts of agricultural waste.

Isolates showed simultaneous extracellular inulinase, xylanase,  pectinase, and cellulase activities. Aspergillus CH-A-2010 showed the highest  production of inulinase activity (1.48 U/ml), whereas Aspergillus niger  CH-A-2016 produced the highest xylanase (1.52 U/ml) and endo-pectinase (2.7U/ml)  activities. In both cases production of enzyme activities was significantly  higher on Agave tequilana waste than that observed on lemon peel and specific  polymeric carbohydrates. Enzymatic hydrolysis of raw A. tequilana stems and  leaves, by enzymes secreted by the isolates yielded maximum concentrations of  reducing sugars of 28.2 g/l, and 9.9 g/l respectively.

METHODS: S. cerevisiae strain ATCC 9763 was passaged in increasing  concentrations of itraconazole. Itraconazole and fluconazole MICs for the  initial isolate (9763S) were 2 and 16 mg/L and for the final isolate (9763I)  were 16 and > or =64 mg/L, respectively. Duplicate sets of total RNA from 9763S  and 9763I were isolated and hybridized to Affymetrix S98 yeast arrays. To  validate results, six differentially expressed genes were further examined by  RT-PCR. RESULTS: Of the nearly 6400 open reading frames represented on the array, a  total of 116 genes (1.8%) were found to be differentially expressed. Cell wall  maintenance genes TIR4 and CCW12, sterol metabolism gene UPC2, small molecule  transport genes AUS1 and YHK8, and stress response gene CUP1-1 were expressed at  a level at least 2.5-fold higher than the expression level found in 9763S.  Eleven energy generation genes, ionic homeostasis genes FRE1, FRE2 and FRE4, and  sterol metabolism genes ERG8 and ERG13 were expressed at least 2.5-fold lower  than the expression level found in 9763S. CONCLUSIONS: Several genes found to be differentially expressed in this study  have been shown previously to be differentially expressed in the fungal response  to azole treatment. In addition, the potential role of AUS1 and/or YHK8 as  mediators of drug efflux is intriguing and warrants further study.', 'Author information: (1)Technology Research Association for Next Generation Natural Products  Chemistry, 2-4-7 Aomi, Koto-ku, Tokyo, 135-0064, Japan.

180,Givosiran is used for treatment of which disease?,"['BACKGROUND: Induction of delta aminolevulinic acid synthase 1 ( ALAS1) gene  expression and accumulation of neurotoxic intermediates result in neurovisceral  attacks and disease manifestations in patients with acute intermittent  porphyria, a rare inherited disease of heme biosynthesis. Givosiran is an  investigational RNA interference therapeutic agent that inhibits hepatic ALAS1  synthesis. METHODS: We conducted a phase 1 trial of givosiran in patients with acute  intermittent porphyria. In part A of the trial, patients without recent  porphyria attacks (i.e., no attacks in the 6 months before baseline) were  randomly assigned to receive a single subcutaneous injection of one of five  ascending doses of givosiran (0.035, 0.10, 0.35, 1.0, or 2.5 mg per kilogram of  body weight) or placebo. In part B, patients without recent attacks were  randomly assigned to receive once-monthly injections of one of two doses of  givosiran (0.35 or 1.0 mg per kilogram) or placebo (total of two injections 28  days apart). In part C, patients who had recurrent attacks were randomly  assigned to receive injections of one of two doses of givosiran (2.5 or 5.0 mg  per kilogram) or placebo once monthly (total of four injections) or once  quarterly (total of two injections) during a 12-week period, starting on day 0.  Safety, pharmacokinetic, pharmacodynamic, and exploratory efficacy outcomes were  evaluated. RESULTS: A total of 23 patients in parts A and B and 17 patients in part C  underwent randomization. Common adverse events included nasopharyngitis,  abdominal pain, and diarrhea. Serious adverse events occurred in 6 patients who  received givosiran in parts A through C combined. In part C, all 6 patients who  were assigned to receive once-monthly injections of givosiran had sustained  reductions in ALAS1 messenger RNA (mRNA), delta aminolevulinic acid, and  porphobilinogen levels to near normal. These reductions were associated with a  79% lower mean annualized attack rate than that observed with placebo  (exploratory efficacy end point). CONCLUSIONS: Once-monthly injections of givosiran in patients who had recurrent  porphyria attacks resulted in mainly low-grade adverse events, reductions in  induced ALAS1 mRNA levels, nearly normalized levels of the neurotoxic  intermediates delta aminolevulinic acid and porphobilinogen, and a lower attack  rate than that observed with placebo.

This results in downregulation of ALAS1  mRNA and prevents accumulation of neurotoxic δ-aminolevulinic acid and  porphobilinogen levels that are associated with acute porphyria attacks.  Givosiran is being developed by Alnylam Pharmaceuticals for the treatment of  acute hepatic porphyria (AHP). In November 2019, givosiran was approved in the  USA for the treatment of adults with AHP based on the positive results from the  multinational, phase III ENVISION trial. In the EU, givosiran received a  positive opinion in January 2020 for the treatment of AHP in adults and  adolescents aged 12 years and older. This article summarizes the milestones in  the development of givosiran leading to this first approval for the treatment of  adults with AHP.', 'Acute intermittent porphyria (AIP) is an autosomal dominant disease caused by  mutations in porphobilinogen deaminase (PBGD), the third enzyme of the heme  synthesis pathway. Symptoms of AIP usually manifest as intermittent acute  attacks with occasional neuropsychiatric crises. The management of AIP includes  treatment of acute attacks, prevention of attacks, long-term monitoring and  treatment of chronic complications. Intravenous injection of heme is the most  effective method of treating acute attacks. Carbohydrate loading is used when  heme is unavailable or in the event of mild attacks. Symptomatic treatment is  also needed during attacks. Prevention of attacks includes eliminating  precipitating factors, heme prophylaxis and liver transplantation. New treatment  options include givosiran (siRNA) to down-regulate ALA synthase-1 (ALAS1) and  the messenger RNA of PBGD (PBGD mRNA) delivered to the liver cells of patients  with AIP. Long-term monitoring of chronic complications includes regular  liver-kidney function and hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) screening.', 'BACKGROUND: Up-regulation of hepatic delta-aminolevulinic acid synthase 1  (ALAS1), with resultant accumulation of delta-aminolevulinic acid (ALA) and  porphobilinogen, is central to the pathogenesis of acute attacks and chronic  symptoms in acute hepatic porphyria. Givosiran, an RNA interference therapy,  inhibits ALAS1 expression. METHODS: In this double-blind, placebo-controlled, phase 3 trial, we randomly  assigned symptomatic patients with acute hepatic porphyria to receive either  subcutaneous givosiran (2.5 mg per kilogram of body weight) or placebo monthly  for 6 months. The primary end point was the annualized rate of composite  porphyria attacks among patients with acute intermittent porphyria, the most  common subtype of acute hepatic porphyria. (Composite porphyria attacks resulted  in hospitalization, an urgent health care visit, or intravenous administration  of hemin at home.) Key secondary end points were levels of ALA and  porphobilinogen and the annualized attack rate among patients with acute hepatic  porphyria, along with hemin use and daily worst pain scores in patients with  acute intermittent porphyria. RESULTS: A total of 94 patients underwent randomization (48 in the givosiran  group and 46 in the placebo group). Among the 89 patients with acute  intermittent porphyria, the mean annualized attack rate was 3.2 in the givosiran  group and 12.5 in the placebo group, representing a 74% lower rate in the  givosiran group (P<0.001); the results were similar among the 94 patients with  acute hepatic porphyria. Among the patients with acute intermittent porphyria,  givosiran led to lower levels of urinary ALA and porphobilinogen, fewer days of  hemin use, and better daily scores for pain than placebo. Key adverse events  that were observed more frequently in the givosiran group were elevations in  serum aminotransferase levels, changes in serum creatinine levels and the  estimated glomerular filtration rate, and injection-site reactions. CONCLUSIONS: Among patients with acute intermittent porphyria, those who  received givosiran had a significantly lower rate of porphyria attacks and  better results for multiple other disease manifestations than those who received  placebo. The increased efficacy was accompanied by a higher frequency of hepatic  and renal adverse events. (Funded by Alnylam Pharmaceuticals; ENVISION  ClinicalTrials.gov number, NCT03338816.).', 'OBJECTIVE: Since 1983, hemin has been FDA-approved for acute intermittent  porphyria (AIP) attacks. In 2019, FDA approved givosiran for the treatment of  adults with acute hepatic porphyria. The objective of this research was to  estimate and compare the total cost of AIP-related healthcare for patients  treated with hemin or givosiran. METHODS: A microsimulation cost model was developed to estimate the annual  economic impact of hemin versus givosiran treatment for patients with AIP from  the U.S. healthcare payer perspective. Hemin treatment costs were calculated  from the Hemin Shipment Data in which patients were defined as receiving acute  attack treatment or prophylaxis treatment based on shipment patterns. Three  separate hemin subpopulations were considered: one attack per year, multiple  attacks per year, and hemin prophylaxis. Treatment costs for givosiran (with  hemin for acute attacks) were simulated based on Phase III trial efficacy  results applied to individual treatment histories in the Hemin Shipment Data.  Other healthcare utilization was also considered. Outcomes were annualized and  expenditures inflated to 2019. RESULTS: For all patients with AIP, the average annual total cost of care with  hemin was 78% lower (difference = $482,113; 95% CI=$373,638-$594,778) than the  average annual total cost of care with givosiran. Average annual total cost of  care with hemin was between 46% and 92% lower than givosiran for the three hemin  subpopulations: one attack per year (difference = $545,219; 95%  CI=$436,584-$657,239), multiple attacks per year (difference = $459,366; 95%  CI=$350,291-$574,403), and hemin prophylaxis (difference = $311,950; 95%  CI=$191,898-$435,893). Cost savings with hemin were robust to one-way and  probabilistic sensitivity as well as scenario analyses. CONCLUSIONS: Hemin is expected to provide cost savings compared to givosiran for  all AIP patients and subpopulations. Lower annual total costs of care with hemin  range from $311,950 to $545,219 less depending on whether the patient uses hemin  prophylactically or for acute treatment attacks.', 'BACKGROUND: Tivozanib hydrochloride (tivozanib) is a potent and selective  tyrosine kinase inhibitor of all 3 vascular endothelial growth factor receptors  with antitumor activity additive to 5-fluorouracil in preclinical models. This  study was conducted to determine maximum tolerated dose (MTD), dose-limiting  toxicities (DLTs), pharmacokinetics (PKs), and antitumor activity of escalating  doses of tivozanib with a modified (m)FOLFOX-6 (leucovorin, 5-fluorouracil  [5-FU], and 85 mg/kg(2) oxaliplatin) regimen in patients with advanced  gastrointestinal tumors. PATIENTS AND METHODS: Tivozanib was administered orally once daily for 21 days  in 28-day cycles, with mFOLFOX-6 administered every 14 days. Patients were  allowed to continue tivozanib after discontinuation of mFOLFOX-6. RESULTS: Thirty patients were assigned to tivozanib 0.5 mg (n = 9), 1.0 mg (n =  3), or 1.5 mg (n = 18) with mFOLFOX-6. Patients received a median of 5.2 (range,  0.03-26.9) months of tivozanib. DLTs were observed in 2 patients: Grade 3/4  transaminase level increases with tivozanib 0.5 mg, and Grade 3 dizziness with  tivozanib 1.5 mg. Other Grade 3/4 adverse events included hypertension (n = 8),  fatigue (n = 8), and neutropenia (n = 6). MTD for tivozanib with mFOLFOX-6 was  confirmed as 1.5 mg. No PK interactions between tivozanib and mFOLFOX-6 were  observed. One patient had an ongoing clinical complete response, 10 had a  partial response, and 11 obtained prolonged stable disease. CONCLUSION: Tivozanib and mFOLFOX-6 is feasible and appears to be safe. The  recommended dose for tivozanib with mFOLFOX-6 is 1.5 mg/d. Observed clinical  activity merits further exploration in gastrointestinal tumors.', 'BACKGROUND: Few therapeutic options are available to treat the late-stage of  human African trypanosomiasis, a neglected tropical disease, caused by  Trypanosoma brucei gambiense (g-HAT). The firstline treatment is a combination  therapy of oral nifurtimox and intravenous eflornithine that needs to be  administered in a hospital setting by trained personnel, which is not optimal  given that patients often live in remote areas with few health resources.  Therefore, we aimed to assess the safety and efficacy of an oral regimen of  fexinidazole (a 2-substituted 5-nitroimidazole with proven trypanocidal  activity) versus nifurtimox eflornithine combination therapy in patients with  late-stage g-HAT. METHODS: In this randomised, phase 2/3, open-label, non-inferiority trial, we  recruited patients aged 15 years and older with late-stage g-HAT from g-HAT  treatment centres in the Democratic Republic of the Congo (n=9) and the Central  African Republic (n=1). Patients were randomly assigned (2:1) to receive either  fexinidazole or nifurtimox eflornithine combination therapy according to a  predefined randomisation list (block size six). The funder, data management  personnel, and study statisticians were masked to treatment. Oral fexinidazole  was given once a day (days 1-4: 1800 mg, days 5-10: 1200 mg). Oral nifurtimox  was given three times a day (days 1-10: 15 mg/kg per day) with eflornithine  twice a day as 2 h infusions (days 1-7: 400 mg/kg per day). The primary endpoint  was success at 18 months (ie, deemed as patients being alive, having no evidence  of trypanosomes in any body fluid, not requiring rescue medication, and having a  cerebrospinal fluid white blood cell count ≤20 cells per μL). Safety was  assessed through routine monitoring. Primary efficacy analysis was done in the  modified intention-to-treat population and safety analyses in the  intention-to-treat population. The acceptable margin for the difference in  success rates was defined as 13%. This study has been completed and is  registered with ClinicalTrials.gov, number NCT01685827. FINDINGS: Between October, 2012, and November, 2016, 419 patients were  pre-screened. Of the 409 eligible patients, 14 were not included because they  did not meet all inclusion criteria (n=12) or for another reason (n=2).  Therefore, 394 patients were randomly assigned, 264 to receive fexinidazole and  130 to receive nifurtimox eflornithine combination therapy. Success at 18 months  was recorded in 239 (91%) patients given fexinidazole and 124 (98%) patients  given nifurtimox eflornithine combination therapy, within the margin of  acceptable difference of -6·4% (97·06% CI -11·2 to -1·6; p=0·0029). We noted no  difference in the proportion of patients who experienced treatment-related  adverse events (215 [81%] in the fexinidazole group vs 102 [79%] in the  nifurtimox eflornithine combination therapy group). Treatment discontinuations  were unrelated to treatment (n=2 [1%] in the fexinidazole group). Temporary  nifurtimox eflornithine combination therapy interruption occurred in three (2%)  patients. 11 patients died during the study (nine [3%] in the fexinidazole group  vs two [2%] in the nifurtimox eflornithine combination therapy group). INTERPRETATION: Our findings show that oral fexinidazole is effective and safe  for the treatment of T b gambiense infection compared with nifurtimox  eflornithine combination therapy in late-stage HAT patients. Fexinidazole could  be a key asset in the elimination of this fatal neglected disease. FUNDING: Drugs for Neglected Diseases initiative.', ""BACKGROUND: Lassa and Junín viruses are the most prominent members of the  Arenaviridae family of viruses that cause viral hemorrhagic fever syndromes  Lassa fever and Argentine hemorrhagic fever, respectively. At present, ribavirin  is the only antiviral drug indicated for use in treatment of these diseases, but  because of its limited efficacy in advanced cases of disease and its toxicity,  safer and more effective antivirals are needed. METHODOLOGY/PRINCIPAL FINDINGS: Here, we used a model of acute arenaviral  infection in outbred guinea pigs based on challenge with an adapted strain of  Pichindé virus (PICV) to further preclinical development of T-705 (Favipiravir),  a promising broad-spectrum inhibitor of RNA virus infections. The guinea  pig-adapted passage 19 PICV was uniformly lethal with an LD(50) of ∼5  plaque-forming units and disease was associated with fever, weight loss,  thrombocytopenia, coagulation defects, increases in serum aspartate  aminotransferase (AST) concentrations, and pantropic viral infection.  Favipiravir (300 mg/kg/day, twice daily orally for 14 days) was highly  effective, as all animals recovered fully from PICV-induced disease even when  therapy was initiated one week after virus challenge when animals were already  significantly ill with marked fevers and thrombocytopenia. Antiviral activity  and reduced disease severity was evidenced by dramatic reductions in peak serum  virus titers and AST concentrations in favipiravir-treated animals. Moreover, a  sharp decrease in body temperature was observed shortly after the start of  treatment. Oral ribavirin was also evaluated, and although effective, the slower  rate of recovery may be a sign of the drug's known toxicity. CONCLUSIONS/SIGNIFICANCE: Our findings support further development of  favipiravir for the treatment of severe arenaviral infections. The optimization  of the experimental favipiravir treatment regimen in the PICV guinea pig model  will inform critical future studies in the same species based on challenge with  highly pathogenic arenaviruses such as Lassa and Junín."", 'Castleman disease (CD) is a rare, heterogeneous lymphoproliferative disorder for  which no standard of care currently exists. Evidence that the pathophysiology of  CD is fueled by excessive interleukin-6 (IL-6) has led to considerable interest  in therapeutic targeting of this cytokine. Siltuximab, a chimeric monoclonal  antibody to IL-6, has thus emerged as a promising treatment option in a disease  lacking efficacious therapy. Here, we review the findings of recent studies  evaluating single-agent siltuximab treatment in CD, including the first-ever  randomized clinical trial in this disease. Although much more work is needed to  establish a standardized treatment approach, siltuximab appears to be a safe and  effective treatment for patients with newly diagnosed and previously treated CD.', 'Gaucher disease is an inherited lysosomal storage disorder, characterized by  deficient activity of glucocerebrosidase leading to storage of glucocerebroside  in tissue macrophages. Type I disease, the most prevalent form, lacks central  nervous system involvement but presents primarily with variable degrees of  hepatosplenomegaly, cytopenia, and bone disease. Intravenous enzyme replacement  therapy can reverse these manifestations. In addition to the two enzymes  currently authorized for use, the newest enzyme, taliglucerase alfa, is at the  late stages of clinical development. Taliglucerase alfa is a unique product, as  it is the first plant cell-based recombinant enzyme therapy. This review  considers the existing evidence for therapeutic efficacy of taliglucerase alfa  in the treatment of the non-neuronopathic manifestations of Gaucher disease.  Clinical studies encompass one phase I trial in healthy volunteers, one phase  III trial, and preliminary results from both an extension study and a switch  study. In the 9-month, randomized, double-blind phase III trial, treatment-naïve  patients with type I Gaucher disease were treated with either 30 or 60 U/kg  every 2 weeks. Dose-dependent improvements were achieved after 6 and 9 months of  therapy, with reductions in spleen and liver volumes and improvements in  hemoglobin levels. Platelet counts improved initially only in the higher-dose  group, but preliminary results from the extension study also show significant  increases in the lower-dose group. Bone marrow involvement, as assessed by  magnetic resonance imaging, improved in almost all patients. Taliglucerase alfa  has shown a good safety profile, with few patients experiencing hypersensitivity  reactions and developing antibodies. An additional enzyme replacement therapy  for Gaucher disease would enable the treatment of more patients and would  provide backup for unexpected production problems. Furthermore, it is expected  that this new treatment would reduce the costs of therapy. Taliglucerase alfa is  a valuable new treatment modality for the non-neuronopathic manifestations of  Gaucher disease.']",Givosiran is approved for treatment of porphyria.
181,Describe King–Kopetzky syndrome.,"['The present study explored illness perceptions of hearing difficulties amongst  one hundred participants who reported experiencing hearing difficulties despite  normal audiometric thresholds. This experience is referred to as King-Kopetzky  syndrome (KKS), obscure auditory dysfunction (OAD), or auditory processing  disorder (APD). Logistic regression was used to consider the associations  between help-seeking and a range of audiological and illness perception  measures. Results indicate that help-seekers present with poorer speech in noise  thresholds than non help-seekers, and that coherent illness perceptions and a  negative belief in the consequences of hearing difficulties are associated with  help-seeking status, regardless of hearing sensitivity.', 'In the present study, mild impairment of cochlear function in patients with  King-Kopetzky syndrome was investigated using DPOAEs. A significant decrease in  DPOAE levels in both ears was found in patients with King-Kopetzky syndrome  compared with the controls after considering the thresholds as a co-variable. It  is noteworthy that the global mean levels of DPOAEs were still significantly  greater in controls than in patients with matched thresholds. Further frequency  analyses showed a significant decrease in DPOAE levels over the mid- and  high-frequency range in patients with better hearing thresholds when compared  with those in the control group. Moreover, significantly smaller DPOAEs were  found in the ears of patients with King-Kopetzky syndrome and without SOAEs,  than in such ears of control subjects after considering the thresholds as a  co-variable. However, when SOAEs were present there was no difference. Decreases  in DPOAE level appear to represent evidence of minor cochlear pathology, and  provide a pathological basis for the difficulty of hearing speech in the  presence of background noise, which characterizes King-Kopetzky syndrome.', 'At least 10% of people who present for help with hearing difficulties will be  found to have normal hearing thresholds. These cases are clinically categorized  as King-Kopetzky syndrome (KKS), obscure auditory dysfunction (OAD), or auditory  processing disorder (APD). While recent research has focussed on the possible  mechanistic basis for these difficulties, the perceptions of the hearing  difficulties that lead people to seek help have not hitherto been identified.  This study presents findings from an observational survey of causal attributions  of hearing difficulties from 100 people with KKS. The findings suggest that  participants regard immunity and risk related causes of hearing difficulties as  pre-dominant. Psychological factors were not considered to be causal for hearing  difficulties. These factors were not affected by diagnostic classification.  These findings inform audiologists about their patient beliefs for the first  time. The authors suggest that clinicians take care to ensure that their  counselling is responsive to these beliefs.', 'King-Kopetzky syndrome is characterized by auditory disability with a clinically  normal hearing threshold. The main reported disability is hearing speech in the  presence of background noise. The degrees of speech-hearing disability in  patients with King-Kopetzky syndrome have been investigated with the use of the  Social Hearing Handicap Index (SHHI), and the relationships between the SHHI  scores and a number of physiological, psychoacoustical and psychological factors  determined in 109 patients. The significantly higher (worse) SHHI scores in  patients with King-Kopetzky syndrome indicate that this group suffer a  considerable degree of speech-hearing disability. In our study, the main  findings are that some psychological factors, performance of the sentence in  noise test and auditory thresholds are significantly correlated with the SHHI  scores. We were unable to find any relationships between the SHHI and frequency  resolution or EOAEs. In a multiple stepwise regression, somatic anxiety and the  performance of the sentence in noise test are the significant predictors of SHHI  scores. These two variables appear to be the main determinants of speech-hearing  disability in King-Kopetzky syndrome.', 'King-Kopetzky syndrome (Obscure Auditory Dysfunction, OAD) has been recognized  as a clinically distinct condition in audiological and ENT clinics. It is  characterized by normal hearing thresholds on pure tone audiometry (PTA) but  complaints of difficulties in understanding speech in the presence of background  noise. In a study on 110 consecutive patients with King-Kopezky syndrome  referred to the Welsh Hearing Institute, subjects were subdivided into seven  subcategories based on sensitized measures of auditory dysfunction and on  psychological assessment. These were: (1) middle ear dysfunction; (2) mild  cochlear pathology; (3) central/medial olivocochlear efferent system (MOCS)  auditory dysfunction; (4) purely psychological problems; (5) multiple auditory  pathologies; (6) combined auditory dysfunction and psychological problems and  (7) unknown. Different subgroups may represent different pathogenic and  aetiological factors. Thus, subcategorization provides further understanding of  the basis of King-Kopetzky syndrome, and hence may guide the rehabilitative  management of these patients.', 'The McKusick-Dungy-Kaufman syndrome is characterized by hydrometrocolpos,  polydactyly and congenital heart disease.

Its polymorphism rs17650 (S>F)  has been reported to be an important factor affecting the binding ability and  effect of antiretroviral protease inhibitors. The aim of this study was to  determine whether the ORM1 rs17650 polymorphism also influences warfarin  therapy. METHODS: A total of 191 Chinese patients with steady-dose warfarin therapy were  enrolled in this study. The patients were studied for warfarin maintenance dose,  the ORM1 rs17650 polymorphism, and two polymorphisms previously demonstrated to  affect warfarin response [CYP2C9 rs1057910 (3) and VKORC1 rs7294 (-1639 G>A)]. RESULTS: Warfarin dose was partially correlated with the VKORC1 rs7294, CYP2C9  rs1057910 and ORM1 rs17650 polymorphisms. Patients carrying the wild-type of  these three genes (n = 96) took a mean dose of 3.0\u2009±\u20091.1 mg warfarin, which was  significantly higher than that taken by the 52 S patients (2.7\u2009±\u20090.7) and 11 S S  patients (2.5\u2009±\u20090.6 mg) (p =\u20090.048). CONCLUSION: We identified ORM1 as another polymorphic gene affecting warfarin  dose requirements. ORM1 S carriers require lower maintenance doses to achieve  and maintain an optimal level of anticoagulation.', 'BACKGROUND: The response to the anticoagulant drug warfarin is greatly affected  by genetic polymorphisms in the VKORC1 and CYP2C9 genes. Genotyping these  polymorphisms has been shown to be important in reducing the time of the trial  and error process for finding the maintenance dose of warfarin thus reducing the  risk of adverse effects of the drug. METHOD: We developed a real-time isothermal DNA amplification system for  genotyping three single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) that influence warfarin  response. For each SNP, real-time isothermal Helicase Dependent Amplification  (HDA) reactions were performed to amplify a DNA fragment containing the SNP.  Amplicons were detected by fluorescently labeled allele specific probes during  real-time HDA amplification. RESULTS: Fifty clinical samples were analyzed by the HDA-based method,  generating a total of 150 results. Of these, 148 were consistent between the  HDA-based assays and a reference method. The two samples with unresolved  HDA-based test results were repeated and found to be consistent with the  reference method. CONCLUSION: The HDA-based assays demonstrated a clinically acceptable  performance for genotyping the VKORC1 -1639G>A SNP and two SNPs (430C>T and  1075A>C) for the CYP2C9 enzyme (CYP2C9*2 and CYP2C9*3), all of which are  relevant in warfarin pharmacogenentics.', ""BACKGROUND: The Azorean population presents the highest standardized mortality  rate for cardiovascular diseases (CVD) when compared to mainland Portugal and  other populations. Since thrombosis is a common cause of CVD, we assessed four  polymorphisms in three thrombotic risk genes - F5 (G1691A), F2 (G20210A) and  MTHFR (C677T, A1298C), in 469 healthy blood donors from São Miguel Island  (Azores). We also analysed the CYP2C9 (C430T, A1075C) and VKORC1 (G1639A)  variants in fifty-eight individuals with predisposition to thrombosis  (possessing at least one variation in F5 or F2 genes and one in MTHFR) to  evaluate their warfarin drug response genetic profiles. RESULTS: Among the 469 individuals, the data showed that thrombotic risk allele  frequencies - 1691A (4.9%), 20210A (1.8%), 677T (41.7%) and 1298C (24.8%) - were  similar to other Caucasians, but significantly different from mainland  Portuguese (chi2, p < 0.001). The combined analysis of these variants identified  twenty-two different genetic profiles (genotype order: F5, F2, MTHFR C677T and  A1298C). Complete homozygosity for all wild-type alleles (GG GG CC AA) was  present in 11.7%, being GG GG CT AA (22.4%) the most frequent profile. The  results also demonstrated that 12.4% (58 out of 469) of São Miguel islanders  have increased genetic predisposition to thrombosis. Subsequently, we evaluated  these individuals for their warfarin response genetic profiles. The data showed  that seven out of fifty-eight individuals are poor metabolizers (two with  CYP2C9*2/*2 and five with CYP2C9*2/*3 genotypes). VKORC1 polymorphism analysis  identified twelve individuals (20.7%) with AA genotype, who probably will  require lower doses of warfarin. The joint analysis of CYP2C9 and VKORC1  revealed that 79.3% (46 out of 58) of the individuals carry at least one  polymorphism in these genes. Within these, twenty-five individuals (43.1%) need  intermediate and/or low doses of warfarin, if treatment is started. CONCLUSION: The present study demonstrated, for the first time, that São Miguel,  and possibly the Azores population, shows significant differences on allele  frequencies of thrombotic risk factors when compared to mainland Portugal. This  research constitutes a primary approach for future studies on CVD, as well as  for the implementation of warfarin dosing protocols using the patient's  genotypic information."", 'Warfarin is an anticoagulant available as a racemic mixture. The R- and  S-isomers differ with respect to relative plasma concentrations, clearance,  potency, sites of metabolism, and cytochrome P450 (CYP) isoenzymes responsible  for metabolism. S-Warfarin, the more potent isomer, is metabolized primarily by  CYP2C9. Genetic polymorphisms resulting from single amino acid substitutions  reduce the metabolic capability of 2C9. A reduction in warfarin metabolism due  to genetic polymorphism may explain the increased warfarin response and bleeding  episodes in some patients. Clinical studies showed an increased plasma level of  S-warfarin, decreased clearance of S-warfarin, increased frequency of bleeding,  and prolongation of hospitalization in patients with variant CYP2C9 alleles.  Adverse outcomes associated with warfarin possibly could be avoided by  identifying patients with variant alleles before therapy and starting therapy at  low dosages.', 'OBJECTIVE: African populations, including the Sudanese, are underrepresented in  warfarin pharmacogenetic studies. We designed a study to determine the  associations between the polymorphisms and haplotype structures of CYP2C9 and  VKORC1 and warfarin dose response in Sudanese patients, one of the most  genetically diverse populations in Africa. MATERIAL AND METHODS: The effect of the CYP2C9 polymorphisms (*2, *3, *5, *6,  *8, *9, and *11), 20 VKORC1 tag SNPs and haplotypes, and clinical covariates  were comprehensively assessed in 203 Sudanese warfarin-treated patients. RESULTS: Patients with the CYP2C9*2,*5,*6, or *11 variant required a daily  warfarin dose that was 21% lower than those with CYP2C9*1/*1 (4.7 vs 5.8\xa0mg/day,  P\u2009<\u20090.001). SNPs around the VKORC1 and POL3S genes were divided into two  haplotype blocks in Sudanese populations. According to multiple linear  regression results, rs8050984, rs7294, and rs7199949 in the VKORC1 and POL3S  genes (P\u2009<0.001, <0.001, <0.001, respectively), CYP2C9 genotype (*2, *5, *6,  *11; P\u2009<\u20090.001), body weight (P\u2009=\u20090.04), target INR (P\u2009=\u20090.007), and concurrent  medications (P\u2009=\u20090.029) could explain about 36.7% of the total warfarin dose  variation. CONCLUSION: Our data revealed that VKORC1 and CYP2C9 polymorphisms are important  factors that influence warfarin dose response in Sudanese patients. Our data  suggest that combinations of the SNPs may improve predictions of warfarin dose  requirements.', 'Determining the optimal dose of warfarin for frail elderly patients is a  challenging task because of the low dose requirements in such patients, the wide  interindividual variability of response, and the associated risk of bleeding.  The objective of this study was to address the influence of 13 common variations  in eight genes on the maintenance dose of warfarin in a cohort of frail elderly  inpatients. For our study, we enrolled 300 Caucasian subjects who were hospital  inpatients, with a mean age of 86.7 +/- 6 years. In addition to age, genetic  variants of VKORC1, CYP2C9, CYP4F2, and EPHX1 were found to be significant  predictor variables for the maintenance dose of warfarin, explaining 26.6% of  dose variability. Among 132 patients in whom warfarin therapy was initiated with  the same low-dose regimen, we studied the relative influences of genetic and  nongenetic factors. The time to first international normalized ratio (INR) > or  =2 was influenced by VKORC1 and CYP2C9 genotypes (P = 0.0003 and P = 0.0016,  respectively); individuals with multiple variant alleles were at highest risk  for overanticoagulation (INR >4) (odds ratio, 12.8; 95% confidence interval,  2.73-60.0). In this special population of frail elderly patients with multiple  comorbidities and polypharmacy, we demonstrated the main impact of genetic  factors on warfarin response.', 'Warfarin is the mainstay of anticoagulation therapy worldwide. Its clinical use,  however, is complicated by the fact that it has a narrow therapeutic index with  potential bleeding complications. The dosage requirement of warfarin to produce  therapeutic anticoagulation varies widely among patients. Recently genetic  factors such as the CYP2C9 and VKORC1 genes have been demonstrated to be  determinants of warfarin response. CYP2C9 is the enzyme primarily responsible  for the metabolic clearance of the S-enantiomer of warfarin. VKORC1 is the  target protein of warfarin which recycles the reduced form of vitamin K, an  essential cofactor in the formation of the vitamin K-dependent clotting factors.  There is strong evidence to support an association between these genetic  variants and a therapeutic dose of warfarin. On the basis of these observations,  the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) approved a labeling change for warfarin  that includes the genetic information of VKORC1 and CYP2C9 as factors  influencing interindividual variability in warfarin dosing. The package insert  as of August 2007 states that ""lower initiation doses should be considered for  patients with certain genetic variations in CYP2C9 and VKORC1 enzymes."" The FDA  has also approved clinical tests for these genetic variants. However, at this  time, validated dosing algorithm and evidence to support the clinical utility of  genotyping and reliable economic analysis are lacking to recommend for routine  CYP2C9 and VKORC1 testing in every patiens before the initiation of warfarin  therapy. In this review, we present the results of several prospective  randomised controlled trials conducted to test the impact of genotype-guided  warfarin dosing in Caucasian and Asian patients initiating warfarin.', 'Personalized medicine is an emerging field with a goal of applying genomic  information as a predictor of disease risk as well as individualization of drug  therapy. For optimization of drug therapy, significant progress has been made in  the past decade in linking genetic variation in genes associated with drug  disposition to prediction of drug response and adverse reactions. For most drugs  in clinical use, the interplay of many factors, including genetics,  demographics, drug-drug interactions, disease states and the environment, result  in the interindividual variability observed during drug therapy. Broadly  speaking, such determinants of drug response are mediated through modulation of  drug concentrations reflective of pharmacokinetic factors, as well as drug  targets, often referred to as pharmacodynamics. It is clear that for  personalized medicine to become clinically meaningful, genomic as well as  clinical and environmental influences must be considered together. We show, for  a number of drugs in clinical use, that genomics-guided treatment options not  only are becoming feasible but are also on the cusp of showing superiority in  terms of clinical outcomes as well as cost-benefit. One of the most widely  studied drugs with regard to genomics-guided dosing options is the oral  anticoagulant, warfarin. Genetic polymorphisms in the gene encoding cytochrome  P450 2C9 (CYP2C9) and those in the target gene responsible for the warfarin  anticoagulant effect, vitamin K epoxide reductase (VKORC1), account for much of  the variability in the warfarin maintenance dose; however, routine genotyping in  warfarin therapy remains controversial. We will outline the importance of  understanding all of the variables that mediate warfarin response as the  prerequisite to successful utilization of genotype-guided warfarin therapy.  Similarly, HMG Co-A reductase inhibitors, commonly known as statins, also  display wide interindividual variability in plasma concentration, response and  toxicity due in part to polymorphisms in transporter genes, including SLCO1B1  and ABCG2. Genetic factors are also important considerations in treatment with  other therapeutic agents discussed, including clopidogrel and tamoxifen.  Implementation of personalized medicine-based treatment options for these and  other drugs, the pharmacokinetics or pharmacodynamics of which are impacted by  functional genetic variations, will require overcoming a number of challenges,  including cost, turnaround time, and demonstration of clinical benefit, as well  as better training of health care professionals about genomics in general, and  pharmacogenomics in particular.', 'PURPOSE: ORM1 is a plasma drug binding protein.

CONCLUSION: We identified ORM1 as another polymorphic gene affecting warfarin  dose requirements. ORM1 S carriers require lower maintenance doses to achieve  and maintain an optimal level of anticoagulation.', 'BACKGROUND: Polymorphisms in the genes encoding the cytochrome P450 2C9 enzyme  (CYP2C9) and the vitamin K epoxide reductase (VKORC1) are known to contribute to  variability in sensitivity to coumarins. Patients with certain common genetic  variants of CYP2C9 (*2 & *3) or a VKORC1 polymorphism (-1639A Allele) require a  lower dose of coumarin and are also at higher risk for over-anticoagulation and  serious bleeding. In August 2007, the FDA label for warfarin was updated to  highlight the benefit of genetic testing to predict warfarin response. AIM: Since the prevalence of these variants in the Lebanese population has not  yet been reported, our aim was to determine the genotypes of CYP2C9 and VKORC1  in our population and to compare allele frequencies with previous findings from  other ethnic groups. MATERIALS AND METHODS: CYP2C9 (*1/*2/*3) and VKORC1 (*A/*G) allelic variants  were assessed by polymerase chain reaction-restriction fragment length  polymorphism assays in a diversified sample of 161 unrelated healthy Lebanese  volunteers. RESULTS: The allele frequencies of CYP2C9 *2 and *3 were 0.112 and 0.096  respectively, whereas VKORC1-1639A was 0.528. Carriers of the CYP2C9 *2 or *3  represented 34.2% of the subjects, whereas those of the VKORC1-1639A represented  73.9%. CONCLUSION: Our data show no significant difference in the frequency of CYP2C9  allelic variants when compared to the Caucasian population, whereas the allelic  frequency of VKORC1-1639A was very high. Over 50% of the Lebanese population  seem to be carrying more than two independent risk alleles, and is therefore  potentially at high risk of over-anticoagulation.']","The following genes have been associated with patient response to warfarin: CYP2C9, VKORC1, ORM1, CYP4F2, EPHX1, CYP2C18, CYP2C19, CYP3A5, protein S, clotting factor V, PROC, GGCX."
183,What is the role of the MCM2-7 complex?,"['During late mitosis and early G1, replication origins are licensed for  subsequent replication by loading heterohexamers of the mini-chromosome  maintenance proteins (Mcm2-7). To prevent re-replication of DNA, the licensing  system is down-regulated at other cell cycle stages. A small protein called  geminin plays an important role in this down-regulation by binding and  inhibiting the Cdt1 component of the licensing system. We examine here the  organization of Xenopus Cdt1, delimiting regions of Cdt1 required for licensing  and regions required for geminin interaction. The C-terminal 377 residues of  Cdt1 are required for licensing and the extreme C-terminus contains a domain  that interacts with an Mcm(2,4,6,7) complex. Two regions of Cdt1 interact with  geminin: one at the N-terminus, and one in the centre of the protein. Only the  central region binds geminin tightly enough to successfully compete with  full-length Cdt1 for geminin binding. This interaction requires a predicted  coiled-coil domain that is conserved amongst metazoan Cdt1 homologues. Geminin  forms a homodimer, with each dimer binding one molecule of Cdt1. Separation of  the domains necessary for licensing activity from domains required for a strong  interaction with geminin generated a construct, whose licensing activity was  partially insensitive to geminin inhibition.', 'The replication fork helicase in eukaryotic cells is comprised of Cdc45, Mcm2-7,  and GINS (CMG complex). In budding yeast, Sld3, Sld2, and Dpb11 are required for  the initiation of DNA replication, but Sld3 and Dpb11 do not travel with the  replication fork. Sld3 and Cdc45 bind to early replication origins during the  G(1) phase of the cell cycle, whereas Sld2, GINS, polymerase ε, and Dpb11 form a  transient preloading complex that associates with origins during S phase. We  show here that Sld3 binds tightly to origin single-stranded DNA (ssDNA).  CDK-phosphorylated Sld3 binds to origin ssDNA with similar high affinity. Origin  ssDNA does not disrupt the interaction between Sld3 and Dpb11, and origin ssDNA  does not disrupt the interaction between Sld3 and Cdc45. However, origin ssDNA  substantially disrupts the interaction between Sld3 and Mcm2-7. GINS and Sld3  compete with one another for binding to Mcm2-7. However, in a mixture of Sld3,  GINS, and Mcm2-7, origin ssDNA inhibits the interaction between Sld3 and Mcm2-7,  whereas origin ssDNA promotes the association between GINS and Mcm2-7. We also  show that origin single-stranded DNA promotes the formation of the CMG complex.  We conclude that origin single-stranded DNA releases Sld3 from Mcm2-7, allowing  GINS to bind Mcm2-7.', 'BACKGROUND: The Mcm proteins are a family of six homologous proteins (Mcm2-7)  that play an important role in DNA replication. They form Mcm4/6/7 and  Mcm2/4/6/7 complexes, but their structures are not known. RESULTS: We found that the human Mcm2/4/6/7 tetramer forms a toroidal structure,  with a central cavity about 3-4 nm in diameter. Observations were made using  electron microscopy, employing the image analysis of single particles. The most  predominant averaged image displayed a toroid harbouring four bulges forming  corners, one of which was larger than the others. This structure was very  similar to the mouse Mcm2/4/6/7 tetramer that was independently prepared and  analysed by electron microscopy. These toroidal structures are distinct from  that of the Mcm4/6/7 hexamer, which was also examined by electron microscopy.  GST(glutathione S-transferase)-pull down and two hybrid experiments suggest that  a putative Mcm6-Mcm6 hinge contributes to the formation of the Mcm7/4/6/6/4/7  heterohexamer. CONCLUSIONS: The Mcm2/4/6/7 tetramer forms a toroidal structure that is distinct  from that of the Mcm4/6/7 hexamer in size and shape.', 'To maintain chromosome stability in eukaryotic cells, replication origins must  be licensed by loading mini-chromosome maintenance (MCM2-7) complexes once and  only once per cell cycle. This licensing control is achieved through the  activities of geminin and cyclin-dependent kinases. Geminin binds tightly to  Cdt1, an essential component of the replication licensing system, and prevents  the inappropriate reinitiation of replication on an already fired origin. The  inhibitory effect of geminin is thought to prevent the interaction between Cdt1  and the MCM helicase. Here we describe the crystal structure of the mouse  geminin-Cdt1 complex using tGeminin (residues 79-157, truncated geminin) and  tCdt1 (residues 172-368, truncated Cdt1). The amino-terminal region of a  coiled-coil dimer of tGeminin interacts with both N-terminal and  carboxy-terminal parts of tCdt1. The primary interface relies on the steric  complementarity between the tGeminin dimer and the hydrophobic face of the two  short N-terminal helices of tCdt1 and, in particular, Pro 181, Ala 182, Tyr 183,  Phe 186 and Leu 189. The crystal structure, in conjunction with our biochemical  data, indicates that the N-terminal region of tGeminin might be required to  anchor tCdt1, and the C-terminal region of tGeminin prevents access of the MCM  complex to tCdt1 through steric hindrance.', 'Mcm10 is an essential replication factor that is required for DNA replication in  eukaryotes. Two key steps in the initiation of DNA replication are the assembly  and activation of Cdc45-Mcm2-7-GINS (CMG) replicative helicase. However, it is  not known what coordinates helicase assembly with helicase activation. We show  in this manuscript, using purified proteins from budding yeast, that Mcm10  directly interacts with the Mcm2-7 complex and Cdc45. In fact, Mcm10 recruits  Cdc45 to Mcm2-7 complex in vitro. To study the role of Mcm10 in more detail in  vivo we used an auxin inducible degron in which Mcm10 is degraded upon addition  of auxin. We show in this manuscript that Mcm10 is required for the timely  recruitment of Cdc45 and GINS recruitment to the Mcm2-7 complex in vivo during  early S phase. We also found that Mcm10 stimulates Mcm2 phosphorylation by DDK  in vivo and in vitro. These findings indicate that Mcm10 plays a critical role  in coupling replicative helicase assembly with helicase activation. Mcm10 is  first involved in the recruitment of Cdc45 to the Mcm2-7 complex. After  Cdc45-Mcm2-7 complex assembly, Mcm10 promotes origin melting by stimulating DDK  phosphorylation of Mcm2, which thereby leads to GINS attachment to Mcm2-7.', 'MCM2 is a subunit of the replicative helicase machinery shown to interact with  histones H3 and H4 during the replication process through its N-terminal domain.  During replication, this interaction has been proposed to assist disassembly and  assembly of nucleosomes on DNA. However, how this interaction participates in  crosstalk with histone chaperones at the replication fork remains to be  elucidated. Here, we solved the crystal structure of the ternary complex between  the histone-binding domain of Mcm2 and the histones H3-H4 at 2.9 Å resolution.  Histones H3 and H4 assemble as a tetramer in the crystal structure, but MCM2  interacts only with a single molecule of H3-H4. The latter interaction exploits  binding surfaces that contact either DNA or H2B when H3-H4 dimers are  incorporated in the nucleosome core particle. Upon binding of the ternary  complex with the histone chaperone ASF1, the histone tetramer dissociates and  both MCM2 and ASF1 interact simultaneously with the histones forming a 1:1:1:1  heteromeric complex. Thermodynamic analysis of the quaternary complex together  with structural modeling support that ASF1 and MCM2 could form a chaperoning  module for histones H3 and H4 protecting them from promiscuous interactions.  This suggests an additional function for MCM2 outside its helicase function as a  proper histone chaperone connected to the replication pathway.', 'The Mini-chromosome maintenance (Mcm) proteins are essential as central  components for the DNA unwinding machinery during eukaryotic DNA replication.  DNA primase activity is required at the DNA replication fork to synthesize short  RNA primers for DNA chain elongation on the lagging strand. Although direct  physical and functional interactions between helicase and primase have been  known in many prokaryotic and viral systems, potential interactions between  helicase and primase have not been explored in eukaryotes. Using purified Mcm  and DNA primase complexes, a direct physical interaction is detected in  pull-down assays between the Mcm2~7 complex and the hetero-dimeric DNA primase  composed of the p48 and p58 subunits. The Mcm4/6/7 complex co-sediments with the  primase and the DNA polymerase α-primase complex in glycerol gradient  centrifugation and forms a Mcm4/6/7-primase-DNA ternary complex in gel-shift  assays. Both the Mcm4/6/7 and Mcm2~7 complexes stimulate RNA primer synthesis by  DNA primase in vitro. However, primase inhibits the Mcm4/6/7 helicase activity  and this inhibition is abolished by the addition of competitor DNA. In contrast,  the ATP hydrolysis activity of Mcm4/6/7 complex is not affected by primase. Mcm  and primase proteins mutually stimulate their DNA-binding activities. Our  findings indicate that a direct physical interaction between primase and Mcm  proteins may facilitate priming reaction by the former protein, suggesting that  efficient DNA synthesis through helicase-primase interactions may be conserved  in eukaryotic chromosomes.', 'Genome integrity in eukaryotes depends on licensing mechanisms that prevent  loading of the minichromosome maintenance complex (MCM2-7) onto replicated DNA  during S phase. Although the principle of licensing appears to be conserved  across all eukaryotes, the mechanisms that control it vary, and it is not clear  how licensing is regulated in plants. In this work, we demonstrate that subunits  of the MCM2-7 complex are coordinately expressed during Arabidopsis (Arabidopsis  thaliana) development and are abundant in proliferating and endocycling tissues,  indicative of a role in DNA replication. We show that endogenous MCM5 and MCM7  proteins are localized in the nucleus during G1, S, and G2 phases of the cell  cycle and are released into the cytoplasmic compartment during mitosis. We also  show that MCM5 and MCM7 are topologically constrained on DNA and that the MCM  complex is stable under high-salt conditions. Our results are consistent with a  conserved replicative helicase function for the MCM complex in plants but not  with the idea that plants resemble budding yeast by actively exporting the MCM  complex from the nucleus to prevent unauthorized origin licensing and  rereplication during S phase. Instead, our data show that, like other higher  eukaryotes, the MCM complex in plants remains in the nucleus throughout most of  the cell cycle and is only dispersed in mitotic cells.', 'Mcm10 has recently been found to play a crucial role in multiple steps of the  DNA replication initiation process in eukaryotes. Here, we have examined the  role of Mcm10 in assembling initiation factors at a well-characterized yeast  replication origin, ARS1. We find that the pre-replication complex (pre-RC)  components Cdc6 and Mcm7 associate with ARS1 in the mcm10-1 mutant, suggesting  that establishment of the pre-RC is not compromised in this mutant. Association  of Cdc45 with ARS1 is reduced in the mcm10-1 mutant, suggesting that Mcm10 is  involved in recruiting Cdc45 to the pre-RC. We find that overexpression of  either Mcm10-1 or Cdc45 suppresses the growth defect of mcm10-1, and that a  physical interaction between Cdc45 and Mcm10 is disrupted in the mcm10-1 mutant.  Our results show that interaction between the Mcm10 and Cdc45 proteins  facilitates the recruitment of Cdc45 onto the ARS1 origin.', 'Activation of the eukaryotic replicative DNA helicase, the Mcm2-7 complex,  requires phosphorylation by Cdc7/Dbf4 (Dbf4-dependent kinase or DDK), which, in  turn, depends on prior phosphorylation of Mcm2-7 by an unknown kinase (or  kinases). We identified DDK phosphorylation sites on Mcm4 and Mcm6 and found  that phosphorylation of either subunit suffices for cell proliferation.  Importantly, prior phosphorylation of either S/T-P or S/T-Q motifs on these  subunits is required for DDK phosphorylation of Mcm2-7 and for normal S phase  passage. Phosphomimetic mutations of DDK target sites bypass both DDK function  and mutation of the priming phosphorylation sites. Mrc1 facilitates Mec1  phosphorylation of the S/T-Q motifs of chromatin-bound Mcm2-7 during S phase to  activate replication. Genetic interactions between priming site mutations and  MRC1 or TOF1 deletion support a role for these modifications in replication fork  stability. These findings identify regulatory mechanisms that modulate origin  firing and replication fork assembly during cell cycle progression.']","The MCM2-7 complex is a ring-shaped heterohexamer helicase, that unwinds the DNA double helix ahead of the other replication machinery. During pre-replication complex (pre-RC) formation, origin recognition complex (ORC), Cdc6, and Cdt1 cooperatively load a double-hexameric MCM2-7 complex onto DNA. Loading of MCM2-7 is a prerequisite for licensing of eukaryotic DNA replication. During S phase MCM2-7 functions as part of the replicative helicase but within the pre-RC MCM2-7 is inactive."
184,Does the CTCF protein co-localize with cohesin?,"[""Kaposi's sarcoma-associated herpesvirus (KSHV) latency is characterized by the  highly regulated transcription of a few viral genes essential for genome  maintenance and host cell survival. A major latency control region has been  identified upstream of the divergent promoters for the multicistronic  transcripts encoding LANA (ORF73), vCyclin (ORF72), and vFLIP (ORF71) and for  the complementary strand transcript encoding K14 and vGPCR (ORF74). Previous  studies have shown that this major latency control region is occupied by the  cellular chromatin boundary factor CTCF and chromosome structural maintenance  proteins SMC1, SMC3, and RAD21, which comprise the cohesin complex. Deletion of  the CTCF-cohesin binding site caused an inhibition of cell growth and viral  genome instability. We now show that the KSHV genes regulated by CTCF-cohesin  are under cell cycle control and that mutation of the CTCF binding sites  abolished cell cycle-regulated transcription. Cohesin subunits assembled at the  CTCF binding sites and bound CTCF proteins in a cell cycle-dependent manner.  Subcellular distribution of CTCF and colocalization with cohesins also varied  across the cell cycle. Ectopic expression of Rad21 repressed CTCF-regulated  transcription of KSHV lytic genes, and a Rad21-CTCF chimeric protein converted  CTCF into an efficient transcriptional repressor of KSHV genes normally  activated in the G(2) phase. We conclude that cohesins interact with CTCF in  mid-S phase and repress CTCF-regulated genes in a cell cycle-dependent manner.  We propose that the CTCF-cohesin complex plays a critical role in regulating the  cell cycle control of viral gene expression during latency and that failure to  maintain cell cycle control of latent transcripts inhibits host cell  proliferation and survival."", 'Contraction of the large Igh and Igkappa loci brings all V genes, spanning >2.5  Mb in each locus, in proximity to DJ(H) or J(kappa) genes.

We therefore hypothesized that CTCF may be crucial for the  contraction of the Ig loci, but no CTCF sites have been described in any V loci.  Using ChIP-chip, we demonstrated many CTCF sites in the V(H) and V(kappa)  regions. However, CTCF enrichment in the Igh locus, but not the Igkappa locus,  was largely unchanged throughout differentiation, suggesting that CTCF binding  alone cannot be responsible for stage-specific looping. Because cohesin can  colocalize with CTCF, we performed chromatin immunoprecipitation for the cohesin  subunit Rad21 and found lineage and stage-specific Rad21 recruitment to CTCF in  all Ig loci. The differential binding of cohesin to CTCF sites may promote  multiple loop formation and thus effective V(D)J recombination.', ""Cohesin is required to prevent premature dissociation of sister chromatids after  DNA replication. Although its role in chromatid cohesion is well established,  the functional significance of cohesin's association with interphase chromatin  is not clear. Using a quantitative proteomics approach, we show that the STAG1  (Scc3/SA1) subunit of cohesin interacts with the CCTC-binding factor CTCF bound  to the c-myc insulator element. Both allele-specific binding of CTCF and  Scc3/SA1 at the imprinted IGF2/H19 gene locus and our analyses of human DM1  alleles containing base substitutions at CTCF-binding motifs indicate that  cohesin recruitment to chromosomal sites depends on the presence of CTCF. A  large-scale genomic survey using ChIP-Chip demonstrates that Scc3/SA1 binding  strongly correlates with the CTCF-binding site distribution in chromosomal arms.  However, some chromosomal sites interact exclusively with CTCF, whereas others  interact with Scc3/SA1 only. Furthermore, immunofluorescence microscopy and  ChIP-Chip experiments demonstrate that CTCF associates with both centromeres and  chromosomal arms during metaphase. These results link cohesin to gene regulatory  functions and suggest an essential role for CTCF during sister chromatid  cohesion. These results have implications for the functional role of cohesin  subunits in the pathogenesis of Cornelia de Lange syndrome and Roberts  syndromes."", 'Cohesin is a DNA-binding protein complex that is essential for sister chromatid  cohesion and facilitates the repair of damaged DNA. In addition, cohesin has  important roles in regulating gene expression, but the molecular mechanisms of  this function are poorly understood. Recent experiments have revealed that  cohesin binds to the same sites in mammalian genomes as the zinc finger  transcription factor CTCF. At a few loci CTCF has been shown to function as an  enhancer-blocking transcriptional insulator, and recent observations indicate  that this function depends on cohesin. Here we review what is known about the  roles of cohesin and CTCF in regulating gene expression in mammalian cells, and  we discuss how cohesin might mediate the insulator function of CTCF.', 'Extraordinary single-cell diversity is generated in the vertebrate nervous  system by the combinatorial expression of the clustered protocadherin genes  (Pcdhα, -β, and -γ). This diversity is generated by a combination of stochastic  promoter choice and alternative pre-mRNA splicing. Here we show that both the  insulator-binding protein CTCF and the cohesin complex subunit Rad21 bind to two  highly conserved DNA sequences, the first within and the second downstream of  transcriptionally active Pcdhα promoters. Both CTCF and Rad21 bind to these  sites in vitro and in vivo, this binding directly correlates with alternative  isoform expression, and knocking down CTCF expression reduces alternative  isoform expression. Remarkably, a similarly spaced pair of CTCF/Rad21 binding  sites was identified within a distant enhancer element (HS5-1), which is  required for normal levels of alternative isoform expression. We also identify  an additional, unique regulatory role for cohesin, as Rad21 binds to another  enhancer (HS7) independently of CTCF, and knockdown of Rad21 reduces expression  of the constitutive, biallelically expressed Pcdhα isoforms αc1 and αc2. We  propose that CTCF and the cohesin complex initiate and maintain Pcdhα promoter  choice by mediating interactions between Pcdhα promoters and enhancers.', 'The CCCTC-binding factor (CTCF) is multi-functional, ubiquitously expressed, and  highly conserved from Drosophila to human. It has important roles in  transcriptional insulation and the formation of a high-dimensional chromatin  structure. CTCF has a paralog called ""Brother of Regulator of Imprinted Sites""  (BORIS) or ""CTCF-like"" (CTCFL). It binds DNA at sites similar to those of CTCF.  However, the expression profiles of the two proteins are quite different. We  investigated the evolutionary trajectories of the two proteins after the  duplication event using a phylogenomic and interactomic approach. We find that  CTCF has 52 direct interaction partners while CTCFL only has 19. Almost all  interactors already existed before the emergence of CTCF and CTCFL. The unique  secondary loss of CTCF from several nematodes is paralleled by a loss of two of  its interactors, the polycomb repressive complex subunit SuZ12 and the  multifunctional transcription factor TYY1. In contrast to earlier studies  reporting the absence of BORIS from birds, we present evidence for a multigene  synteny block containing CTCFL that is conserved in mammals, reptiles, and  several species of birds, indicating that not the entire lineage of birds  experienced a loss of CTCFL. Within this synteny block, BORIS and its genomic  neighbors seem to be partitioned into two nested chromatin loops. The high  expression of SPO11, RAE1, RBM38, and PMEPA1 in male tissues suggests a possible  link between CTCFL, meiotic recombination, and fertility-associated phenotypes.  Using the 65,700 exomes and the 1000 genomes data, we observed a higher number  of intergenic, non-synonymous, and loss-of-function mutations in CTCFL than in  CTCF, suggesting a reduced strength of purifying selection, perhaps due to less  functional constraint.', 'The human CCCTC-binding factor, CTCF, regulates transcription of the  double-stranded DNA genomes of herpesviruses. The architectural complex cohesin  and RNA Polymerase II also contribute to this organization. We profiled the  occupancy of CTCF, cohesin, and RNA Polymerase II on the episomal genome of the  Epstein-Barr virus in a cell culture model of latent infection. CTCF colocalizes  with cohesin but not RNA Polymerase II. CTCF and cohesin bind specific sequences  throughout the genome that are found not just proximal to the regulatory  elements of latent genes, but also near lytic genes. In addition to tracking  with known transcripts, RNA Polymerase II appears at two unannotated positions,  one of which lies within the latent origin of replication. The widespread  occupancy profile of each protein reveals binding near or at a myriad of  regulatory elements and suggests context-dependent functions.', ""The cohesin protein complex contributes to transcriptional regulation in a  CTCF-independent manner by colocalizing with master regulators at  tissue-specific loci. The regulation of transcription involves the concerted  action of multiple transcription factors (TFs) and cohesin's role in this  context of combinatorial TF binding remains unexplored. To investigate  cohesin-non-CTCF (CNC) binding events in vivo we mapped cohesin and CTCF, as  well as a collection of tissue-specific and ubiquitous transcriptional  regulators using ChIP-seq in primary mouse liver. We observe a positive  correlation between the number of distinct TFs bound and the presence of CNC  sites. In contrast to regions of the genome where cohesin and CTCF colocalize,  CNC sites coincide with the binding of master regulators and enhancer-markers  and are significantly associated with liver-specific expressed genes. We also  show that cohesin presence partially explains the commonly observed discrepancy  between TF motif score and ChIP signal. Evidence from these statistical analyses  in wild-type cells, and comparisons to maps of TF binding in Rad21-cohesin  haploinsufficient mouse liver, suggests that cohesin helps to stabilize large  protein-DNA complexes. Finally, we observe that the presence of mirrored CTCF  binding events at promoters and their nearby cohesin-bound enhancers is  associated with elevated expression levels."", 'The cohesin protein complex holds sister chromatids in dividing cells together  and is essential for chromosome segregation. Recently, cohesin has been  implicated in mediating transcriptional insulation, via its interactions with  CTCF. Here, we show in different cell types that cohesin functionally behaves as  a tissue-specific transcriptional regulator, independent of CTCF binding. By  performing matched genome-wide binding assays (ChIP-seq) in human breast cancer  cells (MCF-7), we discovered thousands of genomic sites that share cohesin and  estrogen receptor alpha (ER) yet lack CTCF binding. By use of human  hepatocellular carcinoma cells (HepG2), we found that liver-specific  transcription factors colocalize with cohesin independently of CTCF at  liver-specific targets that are distinct from those found in breast cancer  cells. Furthermore, estrogen-regulated genes are preferentially bound by both ER  and cohesin, and functionally, the silencing of cohesin caused aberrant re-entry  of breast cancer cells into cell cycle after hormone treatment. We combined  chromosomal interaction data in MCF-7 cells with our cohesin binding data to  show that cohesin is highly enriched at ER-bound regions that capture  inter-chromosomal loop anchors. Together, our data show that cohesin cobinds  across the genome with transcription factors independently of CTCF, plays a  functional role in estrogen-regulated transcription, and may help to mediate  tissue-specific transcriptional responses via long-range chromosomal  interactions.', ""Cohesins, which mediate sister chromatin cohesion, and CTCF, which functions at  chromatin boundaries, play key roles in the structural and functional  organization of chromosomes. We examined the binding of these two factors on the  Kaposi's sarcoma-associated herpesvirus (KSHV) episome during latent infection  and found a striking colocalization within the control region of the major  latency transcript responsible for expressing LANA (ORF73), vCyclin (ORF72),  vFLIP (ORF71), and vmiRNAs. Deletion of the CTCF-binding site from the viral  genome disrupted cohesin binding, and crippled colony formation in 293 cells.  Clonal instability correlated with elevated expression of lytic cycle gene  products, notably the neighbouring promoter for K14 and vGPCR (ORF74). siRNA  depletion of RAD21 from latently infected cells caused an increase in K14 and  ORF74, and lytic inducers caused a rapid dissociation of RAD21 from the viral  genome. RAD21 and SMC1 also associate with the cellular CTCF sites at mammalian  c-myc promoter and H19/Igf2 imprinting control region. We conclude that cohesin  subunits associate with viral and cellular CTCF sites involved in complex gene  regulation and chromatin organization.""]","Recent genome-wide studies mapping the binding sites of CTCF and its interacting partner, cohesin, using chromatin immunoprecipitation coupled with deep sequencing (ChIP-seq) revealded that CTCF globally co-localizes with cohesin."
185,Is subdural empyema a complication of sinusitis?,"['The intent of this paper is to raise awareness to primary care and pediatric  colleagues of how a clinically insignificant appearing condition like sinusitis  can lead to a major complication. Subdural empyema is a rare but  life-threatening complication of paranasal sinusitis, otitis media, or mastoid  disease. We report a case of a 12-year-old male patient who originally presented  with clinically insignificant symptoms and later developed intracranial abscess  requiring aggressive neurosurgical intervention. We hope that this article will  raise awareness among colleagues who can educate parents on high-alert symptoms  to watch out for if the patient is discharged home after initial presentation.', 'BACKGROUND: Subdural empyema denotes the collection of purulent material in the  subdural spaceand is commonly seen in infants and older children. In infants,  the most common cause is bacterialmeningitis. In older children, sinusitis and  otitis media are usually the source for subdural empyema. Theclinical  symptomatology is varied and has a wide range including prolonged or recurrent  fever, seizures,meningeal irritation, and raised intracranial pressure. It can  mimic as well as complicate meningitis and aheightened clinical awareness is  therefore paramount. AIMS AND OBJECTIVES: The clinical profile, etiopathogenesis, imaging features  and management of subdural empyema in children is discussed and the relevant  literature is reviewed. CONCLUSION: Subdural empyema is a neurosurgical emergency and rapid recognition  and treatment canavoid life-threatening complications. In most cases, surgical  decompression through burr hole or craniotomyis warranted. Near complete  evacuation of the purulent material and appropriate long-term intravenous  antibiotics are necessary for a gratifying outcome.', 'Despite the availability of new broad-spectrum antibiotics, sinusitis  occasionally causes significant morbidity and mortality. One serious  complication of paranasal sinusitis is subdural empyema, a fulminating  intracranial disease that is invariably fatal if not treated. The symptoms of  subdural empyema may be mild and may be the same as those associated with  sinusitis, or the infection may result in alteration of the level of  consciousness and focal neurologic deficits. Rapid recognition and treatment of  subdural empyema is extremely important. Before magnetic resonance imaging  became available, computed tomography was used for rapid diagnosis of this  infection. Magnetic resonance imaging, however, is now becoming the diagnostic  tool of choice. Neurosurgical intervention and high doses of intravenously  administered antibiotics are the mainstays of treatment. If treatment is  initiated as soon as the diagnosis of subdural empyema is made, the patient has  a good chance of recovering with no, or only slight, neurologic defects.', 'Suppurative intracranial infection, including meningitis, intracranial abscess,  subdural empyema, epidural abscess, cavernous sinus thrombosis, and thrombosis  of other dural sinuses, are uncommon sequelae of paranasal sinusitis. A high  index of suspicion is necessary to identify these serious complications. We  present a patient with subdural empyema in whom the diagnosis was delayed,  followed by a discussion of suppurative complications of sinusitis. The case  shows the rapid progression of subdural empyema, which represents a true  neurosurgical emergency requiring prompt diagnosis and management.', ""INTRODUCTION: Subdural empyema is an uncommon but serious complication of  sinusitis. Despite the use of advanced imaging facilities, modern antibiotic  therapy and aggressive neurosurgical protocols, this condition still carries  significant morbidity and mortality. CASE REPORT: We report an unusual case of sinusitis-associated acute subdural  empyema in a 13-year-old patient, presenting in a catastrophic manner with  acutely raised intracranial pressure. Emergency bifrontal decompressive  craniectomy was necessary both to reduce the intracranial pressure and to drain  the subdural empyema. RESULTS: The full range of intracranial complications subsequently occurred,  including brain abscesses, recurrent subdural empyema and ventriculitis. Despite  this, the patient's outcome was good, with minimal intellectual deficits. CONCLUSION: In cases of severe intracranial infection, we therefore advocate an  aggressive surgical approach coupled with appropriate antibiotics to ensure a  good outcome."", 'A 49-year-old male was brought to the Emergency Department after being found  unresponsive. The patient had multiple seizures and was intubated in the  prehospital setting. A computed tomography scan showed bilateral paranasal sinus  disease, and magnetic resonance imaging showed a right frontal abscess and  subdural empyema. Neurosurgery took the patient to the operating room, performed  a craniotomy, and drained a large amount of purulent fluid. He was subsequently  discharged for acute rehabilitation. Clinicians should consider complicated  frontal sinusitis, especially in the undifferentiated patient presenting with  neurologic deficits and signs or symptoms of sinus disease.', 'OBJECTIVE: To assess the usage of cranial computed tomography (CT) in patients  admitted with meningitis. DESIGN: Retrospective study. SETTING: Heart of England NHS foundation trust, a teaching hospital in the West  Midlands. PARTICIPANTS: Two groups of adult patients admitted with meningitis between  April 2001 and September 2004 and from September 2006 until September 2009. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: The numbers of patients having cranial CT and lumbar  puncture and whether any complications had arisen following lumbar puncture. The  appropriateness of the CT request according to local criteria. RESULTS: A total of 111 patients were admitted in the initial time period and 47  patients in the second time period. In the first group, 67 patients underwent CT  (61%), compared with 36 patients (80%) in the second group. There were eight  abnormal scans (12%) in the initial group including three patients with  radiological features of cerebral oedema. Of these patients, one underwent  lumbar puncture and had no neurological sequelae. In the second group, there  were five abnormal scans (14%) with one presenting a contraindication for lumbar  puncture due to mild ventricular dilatation. A lumbar puncture was performed in  this patient without complication. All patients with abnormal scans had clinical  features to suggest raised intracranial pressure. CT scan requests were  considered inappropriate in 26% of patients in the initial study period and 56%  of patients in the second study period. CONCLUSION: More patients with meningitis are undergoing CT and the number of  inappropriate requests are increasing. There are few abnormal CT scans  presenting a contraindication for lumbar puncture and the majority of these  patients usually have clinical signs to suggest raised intracranial pressure.', 'Despite the frequency of dural tears in spinal surgery, meningitis is a rare  complication reported to occur with a frequency of 0.18%. To the best of our  knowledge, no case of Acinetobacter baumanii meningitis has been reported in the  literature after a dural tear secondary to lumbar spine discectomy. This case  highlights the importance of repairing all dural tears and commencing  antibiotics that cover uncommon bacteria in those who develop symptoms of  meningitis in this setting.', 'Forty-six cases of basilar skull fractures in children were reviewed to  determine the incidence of CNS infection following injury and the possible value  of antimicrobial chemoprophylaxis. The clinical course of the children who were  treated with antibiotics was compared with that of patients who received no  antimicrobial therapy. Included in the study were patients with hemotympanum  alone or with hemotympanum plus additional clinical or roentgenographic signs of  basilar skull fracture; patients with tympanic membrane perforation without  otorrhea but with blood in the auditory canal; and children with either otorrhea  or rhinorrhea. Acute, delayed, or recurrent infection of the CNS did not develop  in any of the patients. This study is the first of its kind presented in  children. It would seem on the basis of the present series that the systematic  use of antibiotic prophylaxis in children with hemotympanum following basilar  skull fractures is unwarranted and that children with other signs of basilar  skull fractures may have an equally small risk of meningitis following injury.', 'OBJECT: The relationship between time of year and surgical site infection (SSI)  following neurosurgical procedures is poorly understood. Authors of previous  reports have demonstrated that rates of SSI following neurosurgical procedures  performed during the summer months were higher compared with rates during other  seasons. It is unclear, however, if this difference was related to  climatological changes or inexperienced medical trainees (the July effect). The  aim of this study was to evaluate for seasonal variation of SSI following spine  surgery in a network of nonteaching community hospitals. METHODS: The authors analyzed 6 years of prospectively collected surveillance  data (January 1, 2007, to December 31, 2012) from all laminectomies and spinal  fusions from 20 hospitals in the Duke Infection Control Outreach Network of  community hospitals. Surgical site infections were defined using National  Healthcare Safety Network criteria and identified using standardized methods  across study hospitals. Regression models were then constructed using Poisson  distribution to evaluate for seasonal trends by month. Each analysis was first  performed for all SSIs and then for SSIs caused by specific organisms or classes  of organisms. Categorical analysis was performed using two separate definitions  of summer: June through September (definition 1), and July through September  (definition 2). The prevalence rate of SSIs during the summer was compared with  the prevalence rate during the remainder of the year by calculating prevalence  rate ratios and 95% confidence intervals. RESULTS: The authors identified 642 SSIs following 57,559 neurosurgical  procedures (overall prevalence rate = 1.11/100 procedures); 215 occurred  following 24,466 laminectomies (prevalence rate = 0.88/100 procedures), and 427  following 33,093 spinal fusions (prevalence rate = 1.29/100 procedures). Common  causes of SSI were Staphylococcus aureus (n = 380; 59%), coagulase-negative  staphylococci (n = 90; 14%), and Escherichia coli (n = 41; 6.4%). Poisson  regression models demonstrated increases in the rates of SSI during each of the  summer months for all SSIs and SSIs due to gram-positive cocci, S. aureus, and  methicillin-sensitive S. aureus. Categorical analysis confirmed that the rate of  SSI during the 4-month summer period was higher than the rate during the  remainder of the year, regardless of which definition for summer was used  (definition 1, p = 0.008; definition 2, p = 0.003). Similarly, the rates of SSI  due to grampositive cocci and S. aureus were higher during the summer months  than the remainder of the year regardless of which definition of summer was  used. However, the rate of SSI due to gram-negative bacilli was not. CONCLUSIONS: The rate of SSI following fusion or spinal laminectomy/laminoplasty  was higher during the summer in this network of community hospitals. The  increase appears to be related to increases in SSIs caused by gram-positive  cocci and, more specifically, S. aureus. Given the nonteaching nature of these  hospitals, the findings demonstrate that increases in the rate of SSI during the  summer are more likely related to ecological and/or environmental factors than  the July effect.']","Yes, subdural empyema can be a complication of sinusitis"
186,Which brain structures have been investigated as potential targets for deep brain stimulation of patients suffering from major depression?,"['A third of patients suffering from major depression cannot be helped by  conventional treatment methods. These patients face reduced quality of life,  high risk of suicide, and little hope of recovery. Deep brain stimulation (DBS)  is under scientific evaluation as a new treatment option for these  treatment-resistant patients. First clinical studies with small samples have  been stimulated at the subgenual cingulate gyrus (Cg25/24), the anterior limb of  the capsula interna (ALIC), and the nucleus accumbens (NAcc). Long-term  antidepressant effects, augmentation of social functioning, and normalization of  brain metabolism have been shown in about 50% of patients. Cognitive safety  regarding attention, learning, and memory has been reported. Adverse events were  wound infection, suicide, and hypomania, amongst others. Larger studies are  under way to confirm these preliminary encouraging results. New  hypothesis-guided targets (e.g., medial forebrain bundle, habenula) are about to  be assessed in clinical trials. The application of DBS for other psychiatric  diseases (e.g., bipolar disorder, alcohol dependency, opioid addiction,  schizophrenia) is debated and single case studies are under way. Standards are  needed for study registration, target selection, patient inclusion and  monitoring, and publication of results to guarantee safety for the patients and  scientific exchange.', 'OBJECTIVES: Deep brain stimulation (DBS) to the nucleus accumbens (NAcc-DBS) has  antidepressant effects in patients suffering from treatment-resistant depression  (TRD). However, limited information exists regarding the impact of NAcc-DBS on  cognitive functioning. The aim of this study was to examine whether NAcc-DBS in  patients with TRD has any cognitive effects. METHODS: A comprehensive neuropsychological battery was administered to 10  patients with TRD before onset of bilateral NAcc-DBS and after 1 year of DBS  stimulation. Neuropsychological testing covered the domains of attention,  learning and memory, executive functions, visual perception, and language.  Performance was analyzed at baseline and after 1 year of continuous DBS. RESULTS: No evidence was found for cognitive decline following NAcc-DBS  comparing test results after 1 year of NAcc-DBS with baseline. However,  significantly improved cognitive performance on tests of attention, learning and  memory, executive functions and visual perception was found. In addition, there  was a general trend towards cognitive enhancement from below average to average  performance. These procognitive effects were independent of the antidepressant  effects of NAcc-DBS or changes in NAcc-DBS parameters. CONCLUSIONS: These results not only support cognitive safety of NAcc-DBS but  also stress its beneficial role in augmenting cognitive performance in patients  with TRD.', ""The burden of depression as a severe illness with high suicidality and  prevalence is immense. Despite substantial advancement in psychopharmacology and  psychotherapy over the last decades a residual group of very ill patients with a  chronic disease and high suicidal risk remains. Modern theories about the  pathophysiology of depression are derived from studies examining the mechanism  of antidepressants influencing the serotonergic (5-HT) and noradrenergic (NE)  systems. Serotonergic fibers originate from the dorsal raphe nuclei (DRN),  noradrenergic fibers from the locus coeruleus (LC). Both nuclei represent  relatively small brain regions and both are controlled to some extent by the  habenular complex. We propose the hypothesis of an overactivation of the  habenula in human major depressive episodes (MDE's). Increased activation of the  lateral habenular nucleus leads to the down regulation of the serotonergic,  noradrenergic, dopaminergic systems and stimulation of the  hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal (HPA) axis. Functional inhibition of the lateral  habenula via deep brain stimulation (DBS) has antidepressive properties. The  hypothesis is based on the findings of a clinical imaging study examining the  habenular after tryptophan depletion and on several animal studies which are  discussed. Providing that our hypothesis will be validated by an analogous  tyrosine depletion study and additional preclinical studies, the next logical  step would be to directly test our hypothesis in patients. Possible criteria for  patient selection, ethical issues and locus of DBS are carefully discussed."", 'Direct peripheral nerve stimulation is an effective treatment for a number of  disorders including epilepsy, depression, neuropathic pain, cluster headache,  and urological dysfunction. The efficacy of this stimulation is ultimately due  to modulation of activity in the central nervous system. However, the exact  brain regions involved in each disorder and how they are modulated by peripheral  nerve stimulation is not fully understood. The use of functional neuroimaging  such as SPECT, PET and fMRI in patients undergoing peripheral nerve stimulation  can help us to understand these mechanisms. We review the literature for  functional neuroimaging performed in patients implanted with peripheral nerve  stimulators for the above-mentioned disorders. These studies suggest that brain  activity in response to peripheral nerve stimulation is a complex interaction  between the stimulation parameters, disease type and severity, chronicity of  stimulation, as well as nonspecific effects. From this information we may be  able to understand which brain structures are involved in the mechanism of  peripheral nerve stimulation as well as define the neural substrates underlying  these disorders.', 'Learning that certain actions lead to risky rewards is critical for biological,  social, and economic survival, but the precise neural mechanisms of such  reward-guided learning remain unclear. Here, we show that the human nucleus  accumbens plays a key role in learning about risks by representing reward value.  We recorded electrophysiological activity directly from the nucleus accumbens of  five patients undergoing deep brain stimulation for treatment of refractory  major depression. Patients engaged in a simple reward-learning task in which  they first learned stimulus-outcome associations (learning task), and then were  able to choose from among the learned stimuli (choosing task). During the  learning task, nucleus accumbens activity reflected potential and received  reward values both during the cue stimulus and during the feedback. During the  choosing task, there was no nucleus accumbens activity during the cue stimulus,  but feedback-related activity was pronounced and similar to that during the  learning task. This pattern of results is inconsistent with a prediction error  response. Finally, analyses of cross-correlations between the accumbens and  simultaneous recordings of medial frontal cortex suggest a dynamic interaction  between these structures. The high spatial and temporal resolution of these  recordings provides novel insights into the timing of activity in the human  nucleus accumbens, its functions during reward-guided learning and  decision-making, and its interactions with medial frontal cortex.', 'PURPOSE: Deep brain stimulation is now widely accepted as an effective treatment  for children with primary generalized dystonia. More variable results are  reported in secondary dystonias and its efficacy in this heterogeneous group has  not been fully elucidated. Deep brain stimulation outcomes are typically  reported using impairment-focused measures, such as the Burke-Fahn-Marsden  Dystonia Rating Scale, which provide little information about function and  participation outcomes or changes in non-motor areas. The aim is to demonstrate  that in some cases of secondary dystonia, the sole use of impairment level  measures, such as the Burke-Fahn-Marsden Dystonia Rating Scale, may be  insufficient to fully evaluate outcome following deep brain stimulation. METHODS: Six paediatric cases who underwent deep brain stimulation surgery with  a minimum of one year follow up were selected on the basis of apparent  non-response to deep brain stimulation, defined as a clinically insignificant  change in the Burke-Fahn-Marsden Dystonia Movement Scale (<20%), but where other  evaluation measures demonstrated clinical efficacy across several domains. RESULTS: Despite no significant change in Burke-Fahn-Marsden Dystonia Rating  Scale scores following deep brain stimulation, parallel outcome measures  demonstrated significant benefit in a range of child and family-centred goal  areas including: pain and comfort, school attendance, seating tolerance, access  to assistive technology and in some cases carer burden. CONCLUSIONS: Sole use of impairment-focused measures, are limited in scope to  evaluate outcome following deep brain stimulation, particularly in secondary  dystonias. Systematic study of effects across multiple dimensions of disability  is needed to determine what deep brain stimulation offers patients in terms of  function, participation, care, comfort and quality of life. Deep brain  stimulation may offer meaningful change across multiple domains of functioning,  disability and health even in the absence of significant change in dystonia  rating scales.', ""OBJECTIVE: To assess the effects of bilateral pallidal deep brain stimulation  (DBS) on mood and cognitive performance in patients with dystonia before surgery  (at baseline, while patients received their usual treatment) and 12 months  postoperatively (while patients received neurostimulation and their medications)  in a multicenter prospective study. METHODS: Twenty-two patients with primary generalized dystonia were evaluated  with tests focused on executive functions. The authors considered the patients'  severe disability and selected the following tests: Raven Progressive Matrices  38, Similarities and Arithmetic subtests of the Wechsler Adult Intelligence  Scale-R, Grober and Buschke, Wisconsin Card Sorting Test (WCST), verbal fluency,  Trail Making Test, and the Beck Depression Inventory. Median age at surgery was  30 years (range = 14 to 54 years), median duration of disease was 18.5 years  (range = 4 to 37 years). RESULTS: Before surgery, no patients showed cognitive decline or depression. The  surgical procedure appeared to be benign cognitively. One year after surgery,  free recall improved. There was a significant reduction in the number of errors  in the WCST. No behavioral or mood changes were found. CONCLUSIONS: Bilateral pallidal stimulation has a good benefit-to-risk ratio as  it did not negatively affect cognitive performance and mood in primary dystonia,  while a significant motor improvement was obtained. Moreover, a significant mild  improvement in executive functions was observed, which may have been related  either to the surgical treatment or to the marked decrease in anticholinergic  drugs."", 'OBJECTIVE: The purpose of this study was to investigate regional structural  abnormalities in the brains of five patients with refractory  obsessive-compulsive disorder (OCD) submitted to gamma ventral capsulotomy. METHODS: We acquired morphometric magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) data before  and after 1 year of radiosurgery using a 1.5-T MRI scanner. Images were  spatially normalized and segmented using optimized voxel-based morphometry (VBM)  methods. Voxelwise statistical comparisons between pre- and post-surgery MRI  scans were performed using a general linear model. Findings in regions predicted  a priori to show volumetric changes (orbitofrontal cortex, anterior cingulate  gyrus, basal ganglia and thalamus) were reported as significant if surpassing a  statistical threshold of p<0.001 (uncorrected for multiple comparisons). RESULTS: We detected a significant regional postoperative increase in gray  matter volume in the right inferior frontal gyri (Brodmann area 47, BA47) when  comparing all patients pre and postoperatively. CONCLUSIONS: Our results support the current theory of  frontal-striatal-thalamic-cortical (FSTC) circuitry involvement in OCD  pathogenesis. Gamma ventral capsulotomy is associated with neurobiological  changes in the inferior orbitofrontal cortex in refractory OCD patients.', 'Relapse to maladaptive eating habits during dieting is often provoked by stress.  Recently, we identified a role of dorsal medial prefrontal cortex (mPFC) neurons  in stress-induced reinstatement of palatable food seeking in male rats. It is  unknown whether endogenous neural activity in dorsal mPFC drives stress-induced  reinstatement in female rats. Here, we used an optogenetic approach, in which  female rats received bilateral dorsal mPFC microinjections of viral constructs  coding light-sensitive eNpHR3.0-eYFP or control eYFP protein and intracranial  fiber optic implants. Rats were food restricted and trained to lever press for  palatable food pellets. Subsequently, pellets were removed, and lever pressing  was extinguished; then the effect of bilateral dorsal mPFC light delivery on  reinstatement of food seeking was assessed after injections of the  pharmacological stressor yohimbine (an α-2 andrenoceptor antagonist) or pellet  priming, a manipulation known to provoke food seeking in hungry rats. Dorsal  mPFC light delivery attenuated yohimbine-induced reinstatement of food seeking  in eNpHR3.0-injected but not eYFP-injected rats. This optical manipulation had  no effect on pellet-priming-induced reinstatement or ongoing food-reinforced  responding. Dorsal mPFC light delivery attenuated yohimbine-induced Fos  immunoreactivity and disrupted neural activity during in vivo  electrophysiological recording in awake rats. Optical stimulation caused  significant outward currents and blocked electrically evoked action potentials  in eNpHR3.0-injected but not eYFP-injected mPFC hemispheres. Light delivery  alone caused no significant inflammatory response in mPFC. These findings  indicate that intracranial light delivery in eNpHR3.0 rats disrupts endogenous  dorsal mPFC neural activity that plays a role in stress-induced relapse to food  seeking in female rats.', 'Monoamine-based treatments for depression have evolved greatly over the past  several years, but shortcomings such as suboptimal efficacy, treatment lag, and  residual cognitive dysfunction are still significant. Preclinical and clinical  studies using compounds directly targeting glutamatergic neurotransmission  present new opportunities for antidepressant treatment, with ketamine having a  surprisingly rapid and sustained antidepressant effect that is presumably  mediated through glutamate-dependent mechanisms. While direct modulation of  glutamate transmission for antidepressant and cognition-enhancing actions may be  hampered by nonspecific effects, indirect modulation through the serotonin  (5-HT) system may be a viable alternative approach. Based on localization and  function, 5-HT can modulate glutamate neurotransmission at least through the  5-HT1A, 5-HT1B, 5-HT3, and 5-HT7 receptors, which presents a rational  pharmacological opportunity for modulating glutamatergic transmission without  the direct use of glutamatergic compounds. Combining one or more of these  glutamate-modulating 5-HT targets with 5-HT transporter inhibition may offer new  therapeutic opportunities. The multimodal compounds vortioxetine and vilazodone  are examples of this approach with diverse mechanisms, and their different  clinical effects will provide valuable insights into serotonergic modulation of  glutamate transmission for the potential treatment of depression and associated  cognitive dysfunction.']","Subgenual cingulate gyrus, the anterior limb of the capsula interna, nucleus accumbens, medial forebrain bundle, habenula, and caudate nucleus have been investigated as potential targeted for the deep brain stimulation of patients suffering from major depression."
187,What is pseudodementia?,"[""BACKGROUND: The literature was reviewed to abstract items which were claimed to  distinguish organic dementia from pseudodementia. Their discriminating powers  were tested in a prospective study. Eighteen of these items were selected to  create a questionnaire which should distinguish organic dementia from  pseudodementia. The gold standard was the final diagnosis given by a consultant  psychiatrist 12-14 months later. METHOD: One hundred and twenty-eight patients referred to our service with a  differential diagnosis of depressive pseudodementia were screened using a  checklist of 44 characteristic features (in the form of questions with 'yes' or  'no' answers) which were claimed in the literature of differentiate between  organic dementia and depressive pseudodementia. This checklist covers the areas  of history, clinical data, insight and performance. RESULTS: Forty points (questions) out of the 44 in the checklist showed  significant discriminating power to differentiate dementia from depressive  pseudodementia (p < 0.01). A principal component and factor analysis was  performed from which 18 questions were extracted. The shortened questionnaire  was able to classify (43/44 cases) 98% of dementia cases and (60/63) 95% of  depression correctly. A new definition has been introduced for 'pseudodementia'  as a syndrome of reversible subjective or objective cognitive problems caused by  non-organic disorder. Thus depressive pseudodementia may be classified into two  subtypes. Type I is a group of patients who have depressive symptoms with  subject complaint of dysmnesia without measurable intellectual deficits. Type II  is a group of patients who have depressive symptoms and show poor cognitive  performance based on poor concentration not due to organic disorder."", 'Pseudodementia is the syndrome in which dementia is mimicked or caricatured by  functional psychiatric disorders. The author describes 10 patients with  pseudodementia and compares its clinical features with those of true dementia.  The syndrome occurred in patients with various psychiatric diagnoses, but a  striking feature in most patients was marked dependency. The recognition of this  clinical syndrome should obviate the need for many neurological diagnostic  studies and lead to earlier and more effective psychiatric treatment.', 'Specific symptoms of depression in aged subjects are presented in the paper.  Cognitive dysfunctions in elder depressive patients (so called pseudodementia)  as well as comorbidity of dementia with depression are special diagnostic  problems. Both etiopathogenetic and clinical issues are discussed.', 'The literature describing pseudodementia was reviewed and a definition for this  neuropsychiatric syndrome is formulated. It is defined as an intellectual  impairment in patients with a primary psychiatric disorder, in which the  features of intellectual abnormality resemble, at least in part, those of a  neuropathologically induced cognitive deficit. This neuropsychological  impairment is reversible, and there is no apparent primary neuropathological  process that leads to the genesis of this disturbance. Data from published  reports and preliminary findings presented here suggest that intellectual  impairment of patients with pseudodementia resembles subcortical dementia in  many of its features.', ""Depression and a number of other psychiatric conditions can impair cognition and  give the appearance of neurodegenerative disease. Collectively, this group of  disorders is known as 'pseudodementia' and are important to identify given their  potential reversibility with treatment. Despite considerable interest  historically, the longitudinal outcomes of patients with pseudodementia remain  unclear. We conducted a systematic review of longitudinal studies of  pseudodementia. Bibliographic databases were searched using a wide range of  search terms. Two reviewers independently assessed papers for inclusion, rated  study quality, and extracted data. The search identified 18 studies with  follow-up varying from several weeks to 18 years. Overall, 284 patients were  studied, including 238 patients with depression, 18 with conversion disorder, 14  with psychosis, and 11 with bipolar disorder. Irrespective of diagnosis, 33%  developed irreversible dementia at follow-up, 53% no longer met criteria for  dementia, and 15% were lost to follow-up. Considerable variability was  identified, with younger age at baseline, but not follow-up duration, associated  with better outcomes. ECT and pharmacological interventions were also reported  to be beneficial, though findings were limited by the poor quality of the  studies. Overall, the findings suggest that pseudodementia may confer an  increased risk of irreversible dementia in older patients. The findings also  indicate, however, that a significant proportion improve, while many remain  burdened with their psychiatric condition, independent of organic dementia. The  findings support the clinical value of the construct and the need for its  re-examination in light of developments in neuroimaging, genomics, other  investigative tools, and trial methodology."", 'Pseudotumor cerebri is a disorder affecting mainly young, obese women.

With the recent approval of two mTOR-targeted drugs (temsirolimus and  everolimus) for the treatment of renal cell carcinoma and mantle cell lymphoma,  this paradigm has been effectively translated into the clinical setting. In this  review, we discuss mTOR biology and regulation, the mode of action of mTOR  inhibitors as anti-cancer agents, and current clinical evidence supporting the  use of rapamycin-like mTOR inhibitors in cancer treatment.', 'Targeted therapies are widely used in cancer because of their effectiveness,  even in tumours that are resistant to conventional chemotherapy such as kidney  or hepatocellular carcinomas. There are different families classified according  to their mode of action. The antiangiogenics block tumor angiogenesis by acting  on VEGF or its receptor. The main molecules are bevacizumab, sunitinib, and  sorafinib. HER inhibitors work by blocking these receptors, which control  different signaling intracellular pathways, and include an inhibitor of HER2,  trastuzumab, and various inhibitors of HER1, or EGFR, including cetuximab,  erlotinib, and gefitinib.

Finally, mTOR  inhibitors act on the signaling pathway PI3K/AKT/mTOR, and key molecules are  temsirolimus, everolimus, and deforolimus.', 'AIM: To describe drugs used in renal cell carcinoma. METHOD: Pubmed search for efficacy, mode of action and side effects for each  molecule. Additional data were searched from the French regulatory agencies  websites (HAS and ANSM). RESULTS: Since 2007, a total of three different therapeutic classes in the  management of metastatic renal cell carcinoma are available. These three classes  are tyrosine kinase inhibitors with sunitinib and sorafenib, the anti-VEGF  antibodies (bevacizumab which is associated with alpha interferon in the  treatment of advanced kidney cancer) and mTOR inhibitors with temsirolimus and  everolimus. These targeted therapies are a major progress in the treatment of  patients with metastatic kidney cancer. The side effects encountered with these  molecules are numerous but serious side effects are less than 5% of all reported  side effects.

Immunosuppression can be achieved by depleting lymphocytes, diverting  lymphocyte traffic, or blocking lymphocyte response pathways. Immunosuppressive  drugs include small-molecule drugs, depleting and nondepleting protein drugs  (polyclonal and monoclonal antibodies), fusion proteins, intravenous immune  globulin, and glucocorticoids. Small-molecule immunosuppressive agents include  calcineurin-inhibitors (cyclosporine, tacrolimus), Target-of-Rapamycin  Inhibitors (Sirolimus, Everolimus), inhibitors of nucleotide synthesis and  azathioprine. The review covers the mode of action of these drugs with a special  focus on belatacept, a new promising fusion protein. Different immuo-suppressive  strategies mean also different safety profiles. Common side effects include the  consequences of diminished immuno- response, i.e. infections and cancer (mainly  involving the skin). Toxic side effects of immunosuppressive drugs range in a  wide spectrum that involves almost every organ. The major interest of this toxic  effects is the cardiovascular tolerance (with large differences from drug to  drug), that are discussed seperately.

Overexpression of the  proto-oncogene Akt/PKB (protein kinase B) has been demonstrated in certain  neuro-endocrine tumours: Akt activates downstream proteins including mTOR and  p70S6K, which play an important role in cell proliferation. RAD001 (everolimus)  is a novel agent that is being trialled in the treatment of neuro-endocrine  tumours, and is known to interact with mTOR. We explored the mechanism of action  of octreotide, RAD001, and their combination on cell proliferation and kinase  activation in a neuro-endocrine tumour cell line (rat insulinoma cell line,  INS1). METHODS: Proliferation assays were used to determine the effects of octreotide,  RAD001, and their combination on cell proliferation. Western blotting was used  to characterize the expression of phosphorylated Akt, phosphorylated TSC2,  phosphorylated mTOR, and phosphorylated 70S6K. RESULTS: Treatment with octreotide and RAD001 inhibited proliferation and  attenuated phosphorylation of all downstream targets of Akt: TSC2, mTOR, and  p70S6K. CONCLUSIONS: In this cell model, octreotide and RAD001 appear to act through a  similar pathway and inhibit the Akt-mTOR-p70S6 kinase pathway downstream of Akt.

METHODS: Recently, a phase I/II trial of everolimus demonstrated significant  reductions in subependymal giant cell astrocytoma (SEGA) volume and decreased  seizure frequency. Subgroup analysis was performed on DTI data available from  this study. TSC patients with SEGA received everolimus, titrated to tolerability  to achieve target trough concentrations of 5-15 ng/mL. DTI (1.5 T, 15  directions) was used to calculate fractional anisotropy (FA) and axial, radial,  and mean diffusivity within regions of interest (ROIs). Baseline scans were  compared to 12-18 months post-treatment and compared to a TSC age- and  gender-matched nontreatment control cohort. RESULTS: Of 28 enrolled patients, 20 had sufficient DTI data. Comparing baseline  values with those acquired 12-18 months after treatment, a significant change in  FA was observed in the corpus callosum, internal capsule, and geniculo-calcarine  region (p < 0.05). Mean change in FA was 0.04 (p < 0.01), driven primarily by a  significant decrease in radial diffusivity. Mean diffusivity of the combined  ROIs decreased slightly (p < 0.05), axial diffusivity remained stable. The  control group showed no change over time. CONCLUSION: Significant changes in FA and radial diffusivity were observed after  treatment with everolimus in patients with TSC, suggesting that the genetic  defect of TSC in the brain may be modified pharmacologically, even in  normal-appearing white matter.', 'BACKGROUND: Neurosurgical resection is the standard treatment for subependymal  giant-cell astrocytomas in patients with the tuberous sclerosis complex. An  alternative may be the use of everolimus, which inhibits the mammalian target of  rapamycin, a protein regulated by gene products involved in the tuberous  sclerosis complex. METHODS: Patients 3 years of age or older with serial growth of subependymal  giant-cell astrocytomas were eligible for this open-label study. The primary  efficacy end point was the change in volume of subependymal giant-cell  astrocytomas between baseline and 6 months. We gave everolimus orally, at a dose  of 3.0 mg per square meter of body-surface area, to achieve a trough  concentration of 5 to 15 ng per milliliter. RESULTS: We enrolled 28 patients. Everolimus therapy was associated with a  clinically meaningful reduction in volume of the primary subependymal giant-cell  astrocytoma, as assessed on independent central review (P<0.001 for baseline vs.  6 months), with a reduction of at least 30% in 21 patients (75%) and at least  50% in 9 patients (32%). Marked reductions were seen within 3 months and were  sustained. There were no new lesions, worsening hydrocephalus, evidence of  increased intracranial pressure, or necessity for surgical resection or other  therapy for subependymal giant-cell astrocytoma. Of the 16 patients for whom  24-hour video electroencephalography data were available, seizure frequency for  the 6-month study period (vs. the previous 6-month period) decreased in 9, did  not change in 6, and increased in 1 (median change, -1 seizure; P=0.02). The  mean (±SD) score on the validated Quality-of-Life in Childhood Epilepsy  questionnaire (on which scores can range from 0 to 100, with higher scores  indicating a better quality of life) was improved at 3 months (63.4±12.4) and 6  months (62.1±14.2) over the baseline score (57.8±14.0). Single cases of grade 3  treatment-related sinusitis, pneumonia, viral bronchitis, tooth infection,  stomatitis, and leukopenia were reported.

METHODS: This was an open-label extension phase of a prospective, phase 1-2  trial (NCT00411619) in patients ≥3 years of age with SEGA associated with TSC.  Patients received oral everolimus starting at 3 mg/m2 per day and subsequently  titrated, subject to tolerability, to attain whole blood trough concentrations  of 5-15 ng/mL. Change in SEGA volume, seizures, and safety assessments were the  main outcome measures. RESULTS: Of 28 patients enrolled, 25 were still under treatment at the time of  analysis.

At all time points (18, 24, 30, and 36 months), primary  SEGA volume was reduced by ≥30% from baseline (treatment response) in 65%-79% of  patients. All patients reported ≥1 adverse event (AE), mostly grade 1/2 in  severity, consistent with that previously reported, and none led to everolimus  discontinuation.

This statistic is mainly attributable to the side effects of  immunosuppression, with loss of allografts due to the chronic allograft  nephropathy that is a consequence of calcineurin inhibitor toxicity or  hypertension. Patient death due to cardiovascular events, infections and  malignancy also contribute to allograft loss. The introduction of the inhibitors  of the mammalian target of rapamycin sirolimus and everolimus in renal  transplantation has increased the repertoire of immunosuppressive protocols  substantially. They have a different mode of action and a different side effect  profile (i.e. lower nephrotoxicity, less hypertension and less neoplastic  potential) than the calcineurin inhibitors. The inhibitors of the mammalian  target of rapamycin therefore provide an especially promising alternative for  the maintenance immunosuppression after renal transplantation.

An ideal candidate for  combination with safinamide is opicapone. This inhibitor of peripheral  catechol-O-methyltransferase supports continuous brain delivery of levodopa and,  thus, the continuous dopaminergic stimulation concept. Both compounds with their  once-daily application and good tolerability may complement each other by  reduction of necessary oral levodopa intakes and ""OFF"" times. Thus, a promising,  future option will be combination of safinamide and opicapone in one  formulation. It will reduce adherence issues and may complement levodopa  treatment.

Until now,  the four orally available medications, fingolimod, dimethylfumarate (BG-12),  teriflunomide, and cladribine have received market authorization, whereas  laquinimod is still under development. Fingolimod is a sphingosine-1-phosphate  inhibitor, which is typically used as escalation therapy and leads to up to 60%  reduction of the annualized relapse rate, but might also have neuroprotective  properties. In addition, there are three more specific S1P agonists in late  stages of development: siponimod, ponesimod, and ozanimod. Dimethylfumarate has  immunomodulatory and cytoprotective functions and is used as baseline therapy.

METHODS: This was a retrospective European multicenter study on eight patients  who had started an intention-to-treat trial of RUF between July 2007 and June  2010. Clinical information was collected via questionnaire. Responder rate was  defined as reduction of seizure frequency ≥50% in comparison to four weeks  before starting RUF. Maximum follow-up was eighteen months. RESULTS: Responder rates were 7/8 patients after 3 months, 6/8 patients after 6  months and 5/8 patients after 12 months. RUF seemed particularly effective in  the prevention of myoclonic-astatic seizures (comparable with drop attacks in  Lennox-Gastaut-Syndrome, for which RUF is particularly effective). Some loss of  efficacy was noticed in the long-term observation. Side-effects occurred in two  patients. Seizure aggravation was not observed. CONCLUSION: RUF seems to be a promising therapeutic option in children with MAE.  Further studies are warranted to confirm these first observations.', 'BACKGROUND: Siponimod is an oral selective modulator of sphingosine 1-phosphate  receptor types 1 and type 5, with an elimination half-life leading to washout in  7 days.

METHODS: In this double-blind, adaptive dose-ranging phase 2 study, we enrolled  adults (aged 18-55 years) with relapsing-remitting multiple sclerosis at 73  medical centres in Europe and North America. We tested two patient cohorts  sequentially, separated by an interim analysis at 3 months. We randomly  allocated patients in cohort 1 (1:1:1:1) to receive once-daily siponimod 10 mg,  2 mg, or 0·5 mg, or placebo for 6 months. We randomly allocated patients in  cohort 2 (4:4:1) to siponimod 1·25 mg, siponimod 0·25 mg, or placebo once-daily  for 3 months. Randomisation was done with a central, automated system and  patients and investigators were masked to treatment assignment. The primary  endpoint was dose-response, assessed by percentage reduction in monthly number  of combined unique active lesions at 3 months for siponimod versus placebo; this  endpoint was analysed by a multiple comparison procedure with modelling  techniques in all patients with at least one MRI scan up to 3 months. We  assessed safety in all patients who received at least one dose of study drug.  This study is registered with ClinicalTrials.gov, number NCT00879658. FINDINGS: Between March 30, 2009, and Oct 22, 2010, we recruited 188 patients  into cohort 1 and 109 patients into cohort 2. We showed a dose-response relation  (p=0·0001) across the five doses of siponimod, with reductions in combined  unique active lesions at 3 months compared with placebo of 35% (95% CI 17-57)  for siponimod 0·25 mg (51 patients included in the primary endpoint analysis),  50% (29-69) for siponimod 0·5 mg (43 patients), 66% (48-80) for siponimod 1·25  mg (42 patients), 72% (57-84) for siponimod 2 mg (45 patients), and 82% (70-90)  for siponimod 10 mg (44 patients). In patients treated for 6 months, 37 (86%) of  43 patients who received siponimod 0·5 mg had adverse events (eight serious), as  did 48 (98%) of 49 patients who received siponimod 2 mg (four serious), 48 (96%)  of 50 patients who received siponimod 10 mg (three serious), and 36 (80%) of 45  controls (none serious). For individuals treated to 3 months, 38 (74%) of 51  patients who received siponimod 0·25 mg had adverse events (none serious), as  did 29 (69%) of 42 patients who received siponimod 1·25 mg (two serious) and 13  (81%) of 16 controls (none serious). INTERPRETATION: Therapeutic effects of siponimod on MRI lesion activity in  model-based analyses and its tolerability in relapsing-remitting multiple  sclerosis warrant investigation in a phase 3 trial. FUNDING: Novartis Pharma AG.', 'Siponimod (Mayzent®) is an oral selective sphingosine 1-phosphate receptor  subtypes 1 and 5 (S1PR1,5) modulator being developed by Novartis Pharmaceuticals  for the treatment of multiple sclerosis (MS) and intracerebral haemorrhage. In  March 2019, siponimod received its first global approval in the USA, for the  treatment of adults with relapsing forms of MS, including clinically isolated  syndrome, relapsing-remitting disease and active secondary progressive disease.  Siponimod is under regulatory review in the EU and Japan for secondary  progressive MS. This article summarizes the milestone in the development of  siponimod leading to this first global approval for MS in the USA.', 'Three oral disease-modifying drugs-fingolimod, teriflunomide, and dimethyl  fumarate (DMF)-are available for treatment of relapsing forms of multiple  sclerosis (MS). All three agents were approved in the last decade, primarily on  the basis of a moderate to substantial reduction in the occurrence of MS  relapses and central nervous system lesion formation detected by MRI. In the  trials leading to approval, the first oral disease-modifying drug, fingolimod,  reduced the annualized relapse rate (ARR) from 0.40 in placebo-treated patients  to 0.18 (FREEDOMS) and from 0.33 in patients treated with interferon β1a  intramuscularly to 0.16 (TRANSFORMS). Teriflunomide, approved on the basis of  the two placebo-controlled trials TEMSO and TOWER, demonstrated a reduction in  the ARR from 0.54 to 0.37 and from 0.50 to 0.32 respectively. The latest oral MS  medication, approved in 2014, is DMF, which had been used in a different  formulation for treatment of psoriasis for decades. In the 2-year DEFINE study,  the proportion of patients with a relapse was reduced to 27 %, compared with 46  % in placebo arm, whereas in the CONFIRM trial, the ARR was reduced from 0.40  (placebo) to 0.22 in the DMF-treated group of patients. In this review, we will  elucidate the mechanisms of action of these three medications and compare their  efficacy, safety, and tolerability as a practical guideline for their use. We  will further discuss effects other than relapse reduction these small molecules  may exert, including potential activities within the central nervous system, and  briefly summarize emerging data on new oral MS drugs in clinical development.']",Safinamide is a monoamine-oxidase B (MAO-B) inhibitor licensed as add-on therapy for people with idiopathic Parkinson's disease who are experiencing motor fluctuations with levodopa.
190,Which transcription factors (TFs) participate in the formation of the interferon-beta (IFN-b) enhanceosome?,"['A functional interferon-beta gene enhanceosome was assembled in vitro using the  purified recombinant transcriptional activator proteins ATF2/c-JUN, IRF1, and  p50/p65 of NF-kappa B. Maximal levels of transcriptional synergy between these  activators required the specific interactions with the architectural protein HMG  I(Y) and the correct helical phasing of the binding sites of these proteins on  the DNA helix. Analyses of the in vitro assembled enhanceosome revealed that the  transcriptional synergy is due, at least in part, to the cooperative assembly  and stability of the complex. Reconstitution experiments showed that the  formation of a stable enhanceosome-dependent preinitiation complex require  cooperative interactions between the enhanceosome; the general transcription  factors TFID, TFIIA, and TFIIB; and the cofactor USA. These studies provide a  direct biochemical demonstration of the importance of the structure and function  of natural multicomponent transcriptional enhancer complexes in gene regulation.', 'Transcriptional activation of the interferon-beta (IFN-beta) gene requires  assembly of an enhanceosome containing the transcription factors ATF-2/c-Jun,  IRF-3/IRF-7, NF-kappaB and HMGI(Y). These factors cooperatively bind a composite  DNA site and activate expression of the IFN-beta gene. The 3.0 A crystal  structure of the DNA-binding domains of ATF-2/c-Jun and two IRF-3 molecules in a  complex with 31 base pairs (bp) of the PRDIV-PRDIII region of the IFN-beta  enhancer shows that association of the four proteins with DNA creates a  continuous surface for the recognition of 24 bp. The structure, together with in  vitro binding studies and protein mutagenesis, shows that protein-protein  interactions are not critical for cooperative binding. Instead, cooperativity  arises mainly through nucleotide sequence-dependent structural changes in the  DNA that allow formation of complementary DNA conformations. Because the binding  sites overlap on the enhancer, the unit of recognition is the entire nucleotide  sequence, not the individual subsites.', 'The transcriptional coactivators CBP and P/CAF are required for activation of  transcription from the IFN beta enhanceosome. We show that CBP and P/CAF  acetylate HMG I(Y), the essential architectural component required for  enhanceosome assembly, at distinct lysine residues, causing distinct effects on  transcription. Thus, in the context of the enhanceosome, acetylation of HMG I by  CBP, but not by P/CAF, leads to enhanceosome destabilization and disassembly. We  demonstrate that acetylation of HMG I(Y) by CBP is essential for turning off IFN  beta gene expression. Finally, we show that the acetyltransferase activities of  CBP and P/CAF modulate both the strength of the transcriptional response and the  kinetics of virus-dependent activation of the IFN beta gene.', 'Transcriptional activation of the IFN beta gene in response to virus infection  requires the assembly of an enhanceosome, consisting of the transcriptional  activators NF-kappa B, IRF1, ATF2/c-Jun, and the architectural protein HMG I(Y).  The level of transcription generated by all of these activators is greater than  the sum of the levels generated by individual factors, a phenomenon designated  transcriptional synergy. We demonstrate that this synergy, in the context of the  enhanceosome, requires a new protein-protein interaction domain in the p65  subunit of NF-kappa B. Transcriptional synergy requires recruitment of the  CBP/p300 coactivator to the enhanceosome, via a new activating surface assembled  from the novel p65 domain and the activation domains of all of the activators.  Deletion, substitution, or rearrangement of any one of the activation domains in  the context of the enhanceosome decreases both recruitment of CBP and  transcriptional synergy.', 'Small molecules that modulate specific protein functions are valuable tools for  dissecting complex signaling pathways. Here, we identified a small molecule that  induces the assembly of the interferon-beta (IFN-beta) enhanceosome by  stimulating all the enhancer-binding activator proteins: ATF2/c-JUN, IRF3, and  p50/p65 of NF-kappaB. This compound stimulates mitogen-activated protein kinase  kinase kinase 1 (MEKK1), which is a member of a family of proteins involved in  stress-mediated signaling pathways. Consistent with this, MEKK1 activates IRF3  in addition to ATF2/c-JUN and NF-kappaB for the assembly of the IFN-beta  enhanceosome. MEKK1 activates IRF3 through the c-JUN amino-terminal kinase (JNK)  pathway but not the p38 and IkappaB kinase (IKK) pathway. Taken together with  previous observations, these results implicate that, for the assembly of an  IFN-beta enhanceosome, MEKK1 can induce IRF3 and ATF2/c-JUN through the JNK  pathway, whereas it can induce NF-kappaB through the IKK pathway. Thus, specific  MEKK family proteins may be able to integrate some of multiple signal  transduction pathways leading to the specific activation of the IFN-beta  enhanceosome.', 'Using nuclear factor-κB (NF-κB) ChIP-Seq data, we present a framework for  iterative learning of regulatory networks. For every possible transcription  factor-binding site (TFBS)-putatively regulated gene pair, the relative distance  and orientation are calculated to learn which TFBSs are most likely to regulate  a given gene. Weighted TFBS contributions to putative gene regulation are  integrated to derive an NF-κB gene network. A de novo motif enrichment analysis  uncovers secondary TFBSs (AP1, SP1) at characteristic distances from NF-κB/RelA  TFBSs. Comparison with experimental ENCODE ChIP-Seq data indicates that  experimental TFBSs highly correlate with predicted sites. We observe that  RelA-SP1-enriched promoters have distinct expression profiles from that of  RelA-AP1 and are enriched in introns, CpG islands and DNase accessible sites.  Sixteen novel NF-κB/RelA-regulated genes and TFBSs were experimentally  validated, including TANK, a negative feedback gene whose expression is  NF-κB/RelA dependent and requires a functional interaction with the AP1 TFBSs.  Our probabilistic method yields more accurate NF-κB/RelA-regulated networks than  a traditional, distance-based approach, confirmed by both analysis of gene  expression and increased informativity of Genome Ontology annotations. Our  analysis provides new insights into how co-occurring TFBSs and local chromatin  context orchestrate activation of NF-κB/RelA sub-pathways differing in  biological function and temporal expression patterns.', 'The Mediator complex regulates transcription by connecting enhancers to  promoters. High Mediator binding density defines super enhancers, which regulate  cell-identity genes and oncogenes. Protein interactions of Mediator may explain  its role in these processes but have not been identified comprehensively. Here,  we purify Mediator from neural stem cells (NSCs) and identify 75 protein-protein  interaction partners. We identify super enhancers in NSCs and show that  Mediator-interacting chromatin modifiers colocalize with Mediator at enhancers  and super enhancers. Transcription factor families with high affinity for  Mediator dominate enhancers and super enhancers and can explain genome-wide  Mediator localization. We identify E-box transcription factor Tcf4 as a key  regulator of NSCs. Tcf4 interacts with Mediator, colocalizes with Mediator at  super enhancers and regulates neurogenic transcription factor genes with super  enhancers and broad H3K4me3 domains. Our data suggest that high binding-affinity  for Mediator is an important organizing feature in the transcriptional network  that determines NSC identity.', 'The multi-subunit, human CRSP coactivator-also known as Mediator (Med)-regulates  transcription by mediating signals between enhancer-bound factors (activators)  and the core transcriptional machinery. Interestingly, different activators are  known to bind distinct subunits within the CRSP/Med complex. We have isolated a  stable, endogenous CRSP/Med complex (CRSP/Med2) that specifically lacks both the  Med220 and the Med70 subunits. The three-dimensional structure of CRSP/Med2 was  determined to 31 A resolution using electron microscopy and single-particle  reconstruction techniques. Despite lacking both Med220 and Med70, CRSP/Med2  displays potent, activator-dependent transcriptional coactivator function in  response to VP16, Sp1, and Sp1/SREBP-1a in vitro using chromatin templates.  However, CRSP/Med2 is unable to potentiate activated transcription from a  vitamin D receptor-responsive promoter, which requires interaction with Med220  for coactivator recruitment, whereas VDR-directed activation by CRSP/Med occurs  normally. Thus, it appears that CRSP/Med may be regulated by a combinatorial  assembly mechanism that allows promoter-selective function upon exchange of  specific coactivator targets.', 'We have previously identified a silencer (negative enhancer) in glutathione  transferase P (GST-P) gene which is strongly and specifically induced during  hepatocarcinogenesis of the rat. At least three trans-acting factors bind to  multiple cis-elements located in this silencer. One of these factors, SF-B  (Silencer Factor B) specifically binds to GPS1 (GST-P Silencer 1) and has been  cloned by a Southwestern protocol. Analysis of DNA and deduced amino acid  sequence reveals that SF-B clone is most likely identical to an IL-6 inducible  trans-activator LAP/IL6-DBP. Binding efficiency of SF-B to GPS1 is  indistinguishable from that to IL6-responsive element found in C-reactive  protein gene. The possibility that SF-B/LAP/IL6-DBP functions as a dual positive  and negative regulator is discussed.', 'NuA4 (nucleosome acetyltransferase of H4) promotes transcriptional initiation of  TFIID (a complex of TBP and TBP-associated factors [TAFs])-dependent ribosomal  protein genes involved in ribosome biogenesis. However, it is not clearly  understood how NuA4 regulates the transcription of ribosomal protein genes.  Here, we show that NuA4 is recruited to the promoters of ribosomal protein  genes, such as RPS5, RPL2B, and RPS11B, for TFIID recruitment to initiate  transcription, and the recruitment of NuA4 to these promoters is impaired in the  absence of its Eaf1p component. Intriguingly, impaired NuA4 recruitment in a  Δeaf1 strain depletes recruitment of TFIID (a TAF-dependent form of TBP) but not  the TAF-independent form of TBP to the promoters of ribosomal protein genes.  However, in the absence of NuA4, SAGA (Spt-Ada-Gcn5-acetyltransferase) is  involved in targeting the TAF-independent form of TBP to the promoters of  ribosomal protein genes for transcriptional initiation. Thus, NuA4 plays an  important role in targeting TFIID to the promoters of ribosomal protein genes  for transcriptional initiation in vivo. Such a function is mediated via its  targeted histone acetyltransferase activity. In the absence of NuA4, ribosomal  protein genes lose TFIID dependency and become SAGA dependent for  transcriptional initiation. Collectively, these results provide significant  insights into the regulation of ribosomal protein gene expression and, hence,  ribosome biogenesis and functions.']","Transcriptional activation of the IFN beta gene in response to virus infection requires the assembly of an enhanceosome, consisting of the transcriptional activators NF-kappa B, IRF1, ATF2/c-Jun, and the architectural protein HMG I(Y).

191,Which cyclin- dependent kinase inhibitor is regulated by Bmi-1?,"['In this issue of Cell Stem Cell, Fasano et al. (2007) investigate the role of  Bmi-1 in neural stem cells in vitro and in vivo. They find a progressively  increasing requirement for Bmi-1 function in stem cells during development that,  surprisingly, seems to involve regulation of the cell-cycle inhibitor p21.', 'AIMS: The polycomb factor BMI-1 has recently been implicated in tumorigenesis of  the central nervous system in several experimental animal models. However, the  significance of BMI-1 in human glioma has not been investigated. Here we  describe expression of the polycomb protein BMI-1 and its downstream targets  p16(Ink4a) and MDM2 in both high- and low-grade human glioma. METHODS: Tumour samples were collected from 305 adult patients treated for  primary grades 2-4 gliomas between 1980 and 2006 in Finland and Germany. BMI-1,  p16 and MDM2 expression was evaluated using immunohistochemistry in  representative paraffin-embedded tumour tissue. The significance of observed  immunoreactivity, age at onset, gender, histopathological findings and  proliferative index was analysed in univariate and multivariate survival models. RESULTS: BMI-1 was expressed in all histologic types of diffuse gliomas. We  found a significant correlation (P = 0.007) between the frequency of BMI-1  immunoreactive tumour cells and poor survival in World Health Organization  grades II-III oligodendrogliomas and oligoastrocytomas (n = 62). The median  survival of patients grouped by low, intermediate or high frequency of BMI-1  immunoreactive tumour cells was 191 months, 151 months and 68 months,  respectively. This association was also significant in the Cox multivariate  regression model. Nuclear p16 immunopositivity predicted better survival in  astrocytomas and an inverse correlation between p16 expression and the Ki-67  mitotic index was also observed. CONCLUSIONS: BMI-1 is found in all histological types of gliomas and the  relative protein expression of BMI-1 is a novel independent prognostic marker in  oligodendroglial tumours.', 'It is generally assumed that squamous cell carcinoma develops in a stepwise  manner from normal bronchial epithelium towards cancer by the accumulation of  (epi)genetic alterations. Several mechanisms including mutations and homozygous  deletions or hypermethylation of the p16(INK4a) promoter region can cause loss  of p16 expression. Recent studies suggest overexpression of the polycomb-group  gene BMI-1 might also down-regulate p16 expression. In this study, we analyzed  the p16 expression in relation to the methylation status of the p16 promoter  region of the p16(INK4a) gene and the expression of BMI-1 in bronchial squamous  cell carcinomas (SCC) and its premalignant lesions. Nine (69%) SCC showed loss  of p16 expression and 10 (77%) showed expression of BMI-1. Of four p16 positive  samples two (50%) were BMI-1 positive, whereas among nine p16 negative samples,  eight (89%) revealed BMI-1 staining. Four (44%) p16 negative samples were  hypermethylated at the p16(INK4a) promoter region; the other p16 negative tumors  that showed no hypermethylation revealed BMI-1 staining. Only two premalignant  lesions showed absence of p16 expression, of which one (carcinoma in situ) was  hypermethylated at the p16(INK4a) promoter region and the other (severe  dysplasia) showed BMI-1 expression. In total, 11 precursor lesions (48%)  revealed BMI-1 expression. In conclusion, the results of this study suggest that  loss of p16 expression by promoter hypermethylation is inconsistently and occurs  late in the carcinogenic process at the level of severe dysplasia. To what  extent overexpression of the polycomb-group protein BMI-1 attributes to down  regulating of p16 expression remains unclear.', 'The molecular mechanisms that regulate the age-induced increase of p16(INK4a)  expression associated with decreased beta-cell proliferation and regeneration  are not well understood. We report that in aged islets, derepression of the  Ink4a/Arf locus is associated with decreased Bmi-1 binding, loss of H2A  ubiquitylation, increased MLL1 recruitment, and a concomitant increase in H3K4  trimethylation. During beta-cell regeneration these histone modifications are  reversed resulting in reduced p16(INK4a) expression and increased proliferation.  We suggest that PcG and TrxG proteins impart a combinatorial code of histone  modifications on the Ink4a/Arf locus to control beta-cell proliferation during  aging and regeneration.', 'Knockout studies have shown that the polycomb gene Bmi-1 is important for  postnatal, but not embryonic, neural stem cell (NSC) self-renewal and have  identified the cell-cycle inhibitors p16/p19 as molecular targets. Here, using  lentiviral-delivered shRNAs in vitro and in vivo, we determined that Bmi-1 is  also important for NSC self-renewal in the embryo. We found that neural  progenitors depend increasingly on Bmi-1 for proliferation as development  proceeds from embryonic through adult stages. Acute shRNA-mediated Bmi-1  reduction causes defects in embryonic and adult NSC proliferation and  self-renewal that, unexpectedly, are mediated by a different cell-cycle  inhibitor, p21. Gene array analyses revealed developmental differences in  Bmi-1-controlled expression of genes in the p21-Rb cell cycle regulatory  pathway. Our data therefore implicate p21 as an important Bmi-1 target in NSCs,  potentially with stage-related differences. Understanding stage-related  mechanisms underlying NSC self-renewal has important implications for  development of stem cell-based therapies.', 'The polycomb gene Bmi-1 is required for the self-renewal of stem cells from  diverse tissues, including the central nervous system (CNS). Bmi-1 expression is  elevated in most human gliomas, irrespective of grade, raising the question of  whether Bmi-1 over-expression is sufficient to promote self-renewal or  tumorigenesis by CNS stem/progenitor cells. To test this we generated  Nestin-Bmi-1-GFP transgenic mice. Analysis of two independent lines with  expression in the fetal and adult CNS demonstrated that transgenic neural stem  cells formed larger colonies, more self-renewing divisions, and more neurons in  culture. However, in vivo, Bmi-1 over-expression had little effect on CNS stem  cell frequency, subventricular zone proliferation, olfactory bulb neurogenesis,  or neurogenesis/gliogenesis during development. Bmi-1 transgenic mice were born  with enlarged lateral ventricles and a minority developed idiopathic  hydrocephalus as adults, but none of the transgenic mice formed detectable CNS  tumors, even when aged. The more pronounced effects of Bmi-1 over-expression in  culture were largely attributable to the attenuated induction of p16(Ink4a) and  p19(Arf) in culture, proteins that are generally not expressed by neural  stem/progenitor cells in young mice in vivo. Bmi-1 over-expression therefore has  more pronounced effects in culture and does not appear to be sufficient to  induce tumorigenesis in vivo.', 'It is generally assumed that squamous cell carcinoma develops in a stepwise  manner from normal bronchial epithelium towards cancer by the accumulation of  (epi)genetic alterations.

Thus, genes that negatively  regulate tumor suppressors could be considered novel types of oncogenes such as  Bmi-1 repressing p16Ink4a and inhibiting p53 and were found to be frequently  up-regulated in a variety of cancers. p38 mitogen-activated protein kinase  (MAPK), which reportedly plays a crucial role as a tumor suppressor, is  activated in number of lung adenocarcinomas, which is seemingly at odds with its  role as a tumor suppressor. METHODS: We examined 10 lung adenocarcinomas and corresponding normal tissues  and determined the expression levels of a variety of tumor suppressor proteins  through real-time polymerase chain reaction and immunohistochemistry and  measured p38 MAPK activity by immunoblotting or immunohistochemistry analysis.  In the in vitro cellular model, p38 activation by H-Ras and consequent  senescence induction was achieved through retro-viral gene transduction.  Similarly, the suppression of p16Ink4a by Bmi-1 after the introduction of H-Ras  was achieved through transient transfection with cationic liposome. RESULTS: We detected several lung adenocarcinomas that were positive for  activated p38 MAPK but evidenced reduced levels of p16Ink4a expression. The  suppression of p16Ink4a occurred in parallel with an increase in Bmi-1 and/or  p16Ink4a promoter hypermethylation. Consistent with these observations, the  H-Ras-stimulated induction of p16Ink4a was suppressed significantly through the  coexpression of Bmi-1 in vitro. DISCUSSION: These results demonstrate that the suppression of p16Ink4a by either  the induction of Bmi-1 or the hypermethylation of p16Ink4 may be an important  step in avoiding tumor surveillance by p38 MAPK during the development of lung  cancer.', 'PURPOSE: Leptin, an adipose secreted cytokine, is implicated in mammary cancer  stem cell self-renewal and tumor growth in murine mammary tumor virus  (MMTV)-Wnt-1 transgenic mice. In vitro studies indicate that leptin induces  expression of cyclin D1, a cell-cycle control protein necessary for mammary  tumor development. The aim of the present study was to assess cyclin D1  expression in spontaneous tumors that develop in the MMTV-Wnt-1 transgenic mice  and interrogate the in vivo effect of leptin. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Cells derived from spontaneous MMTV-Wnt-1 tumors were  orthotopically transplanted into wild-type, leptin-deficient, and  hyperleptinemic mice. After 6\xa0weeks, tumors were collected and formalin fixed.  Immunoflurescence staining was used to assess cyclin D1, keratin 8, α-SMA,  phospho-AKT expression. RESULTS: Cyclin D1 is expressed exclusively in luminal keratin 8 immunoreactive  tumor cells and is dependent on the adipose secreted hormone leptin. Tumor cell  transplant into leptin-deficient mice resulted in approximately an 80\xa0%  reduction of cyclin D1 immunoreactivity in keratin 8 luminal epithelial cells,  and this was independent of Akt activation. CONCLUSIONS: These data and our previous findings indicate that inhibition of  leptin signaling provides an excellent therapeutic target for breast cancer. The  current data indicate that in luminal mammary tumors, leptin antagonists would  potentially inhibit growth in a cyclin D1-dependent mechanism. In contrast, in  basal mammary tumors, leptin antagonists would inhibit growth in an  Akt-dependent manner leading to reduction in cancer stem cell self-renewal.  Thus, leptin therapeutics may inhibit breast cancer via distinct mechanisms  related to tumor type.', 'Loss-of-function alterations of INK4A are commonly observed in lymphoid  malignancies, but are consistently absent in pre-B cell leukemias induced by the  chimeric oncoprotein E2a-Pbx1 created by t(1;19) chromosomal translocations. We  report here that experimental induction of E2a-Pbx1 enhances expression of  BMI-1, a lymphoid oncogene whose product functions as a transcriptional  repressor of the INK4A-ARF tumor suppressor locus. Bmi-1-deficient hematopoietic  progenitors are resistant to transformation by E2a-Pbx1; however, the  requirement for Bmi-1 is alleviated in cells deficient for both Bmi-1 and  INK4A-ARF. Furthermore, the adverse effects of E2a-Pbx1 on pre-B cell survival  and differentiation are partially bypassed by forced expression of p16(Ink4a).  These results link E2a-Pbx1 with Bmi-1 on an oncogenic pathway that is likely to  play a role in the pathogenesis of human lymphoid leukemias through  downregulation of the INK4A-ARF gene.']",p16INK4 (also known as CDKN2A)
192,"What is the phenomenon described as ""complex coacervation""?","['We report the effect of neutral macromolecular crowders poly(ethylene glycol)  (PEG) (8 kDa) and Ficoll (70 kDa) on liquid-liquid phase separation in a  polyuridylic acid (polyU)/spermine complex coacervate system. The addition of  PEG decreased both the amount of spermine required for phase separation and the  coacervation temperature (TC). We interpret these effects on phase behavior as  arising due to excluded volume and preferential interactions on both the  secondary structure/condensation of spermine-associated polyU molecules and on  the association of soluble polyU/spermine polyelectrolyte complexes to form  coacervate droplets. Examination of coacervates formed in the presence of  fluorescently-labeled PEG or Ficoll crowders indicated that Ficoll is  accumulated while PEG is excluded from the coacervate phase, which provides  further insight into the differences in phase behavior. Crowding agents impact  distribution of a biomolecular solute: partitioning of a fluorescently-labeled  U15 RNA oligomer into the polyU/spermine coacervates was increased approximately  two-fold by 20 wt% Ficoll 70 kDa and by more than two orders of magnitude by 20  wt% PEG 8 kDa. The volume of the coacervate phase decreased in the presence of  crowder relative to a dilute buffer solution. These findings indicate that  potential impacts of macromolecular crowding on phase behavior and solute  partitioning should be considered in model systems for intracellular  membraneless organelles.', 'Complex coacervation is an associative liquid/liquid phase separation resulting  in the formation of two liquid phases: a polymer-rich coacervate phase and a  dilute continuous solvent phase. In the presence of a third liquid phase in the  form of disperse oil droplets, the coacervate phase tends to wet the oil/water  interface. This affinity has long been known and used for the formation of  core/shell capsules. However, while encapsulation by simple or complex  coacervation has been used empirically for decades, there is a lack of a  thorough understanding of the three-phase wetting phenomena that control the  formation of encapsulated, compound droplets and the role of the viscoelasticity  of the biopolymers involved. In this contribution, we review and discuss the  interplay of wetting phenomena and fluid viscoelasticity in coacervate/oil/water  systems from the perspective of colloid chemistry and fluid dynamics, focusing  on aspects of rheology, interfacial tension measurements at the  coacervate/solvent interface, and on the formation and fragmentation of  three-phase compound drops.', 'There has been a resurgence of interest in complex coacervation, a form of  liquid-liquid phase separation (LLPS) in systems of oppositely charged  macroions, but very few reports describe the somewhat anomalous coacervation  between acidic and basic proteins, which occurs under very narrow ranges of  conditions. We sought to identify the roles of equilibrium interprotein  complexes during the coacervation of β-lactoglobulin dimer (BLG2) with  lactoferrin (LF) and found that this LLPS arises specifically from LF(BLG2)2. We  followed the progress of complexation and coacervation as a function of r, the  LF/BLG molar ratio, using turbidity to monitor the degree of coacervation and  proton release and dynamic light scattering (DLS) to assess the stoichiometry  and abundance of complexes. Isothermal titration calorimetry (ITC) showed that  initial complex formation is endothermic, but a large exotherm related to  coacervate formation obscured other regions. On the basis of turbidimetry,  proton release, and DLS, we propose a speciation diagram that presents the  abundance of various complexes as a function of r. Although multiple species  could be simultaneously present, distinct regions could be identified  corresponding to equilibria among particular protein pairs.', 'Coacervation was defined as the phenomenon in which a colloidal dispersion  separated into colloid-rich (the coacervate), and colloid-poor phases, both with  the same solvent. Complex coacervation covered the situation in which a mixture  of two polymeric polyions with opposite charge separated into liquid dilute and  concentrated phases, in the same solvent, with both phases, at equilibrium,  containing both polyions. Voorn and Overbeek provided the first theoretical  analysis of complex coacervation by applying Flory-Huggins polymer statistics to  model the random mixing of the polyions and their counter ions in solution,  assuming completely random mixing of the polyions in each phase, with the  electrostatic free energy, ΔG(elect), providing the driving force. However,  experimentally complete randomness does not apply: polyion size, heterogeneity,  chain stiffness and charge density (σ) all affect the equilibrium phase  separation and phase concentrations. Moreover, in pauci-disperse systems  multiple phases are often observed. As an alternative, Veis and Aranyi proposed  the formation of charge paired Symmetrical Aggregates (SA) as an initial step,  followed by phase separation driven by the interaction parameter, χ(23),  combining both entropy and enthalpy factors other than the ΔG(elect)  electrostatic term. This two stage path to equilibrium phase separation allows  for understanding and quantifying and modeling the diverse aggregates produced  by interactions between polyampholyte molecules of different charge density, σ,  and intrinsic polyion structure.', 'Complex coacervation is a phenomenon of phase separation that may occur in a  solution of positively and negatively charged polyions. The resulting two phases  are distinguished by the total concentration of both polyions, with the  concentrated phase often containing vesicular structures composed of the two  polyelectrolytes. We have used this phenomenon in an attempt to-prepare a  hemoglobin-based red blood cell analog. Hemoglobin-containing coacervate  vesicles have been prepared from gelatin A and the polyanionic carbohydrates  acacia, pectin, or dextranstilfate. Hemoglobin seems to be anchored into the  vesicle walls through interaction of its polyanion binding site with the  negatively charged residues on the carbohydrates. Oxygen binding by the  immobilized HbA is reversible and cooperative, with p50 values at 20 degrees C  of 2.8, 6, and 24 mm Hg for the acacia- (pH 7.5), pectin- (pH 6.6), and  dextransulfate-(pH 6.6) derived coacervates. Kinetic studies on CO binding show  that the rate of CO uptake by the coacervates (t((1/2)) = 13-27 ms at 0.5 mM CO)  is similar to that of human erythrocytes.The HbA-containing coacervates slowly  dissolve in isotonic salt solutions (145 mM NaCl, pH 7.4), but they can be  stabilized by treatment with glutaraldehyde. Oxygen binding by HbA incorporated  into the stabilized coacervates derived from dextran sulfate is very similar to  oxy gen binding by human red blood cells: p50 = 26 mm Hg and n = 1.89 at 37  degrees C in isotonic salt. These results show how a novel approach, based on an  old concept, has led to the preparation of immobilized HbA, with functional  properties similar to those of intraerythrocytic HbA.', 'Netherton syndrome (NTS) is a rare genetic skin disease caused by mutations in  the serine protease inhibitor Kazal-type 5 gene, which encodes the  lympho-epithelial Kazal-type-related inhibitor. NTS patients have profoundly  impaired skin barrier function. As stratum corneum (SC) lipids have a crucial  role in the skin barrier function, we investigated the SC lipid composition and  organization in NTS patients. We studied the SC lipid composition by means of  mass spectrometry, and the lipid organization was examined by infrared  spectroscopy and X-ray diffraction. Decreased free fatty acid (FFA) chain length  and increased levels of monounsaturated FFAs were observed in the SC of NTS  patients compared with controls. Furthermore, the level of short-chain ceramides  (CERs) was enhanced in NTS patients and a strong reduction in long-chain CER  levels was seen in several patients. The changes in lipid composition modified  the lipid organization leading to an increased disordering of the lipids  compared with the controls. In addition, in a subgroup of patients the  organization of the lipid layers changed dramatically. The altered FFA and CER  profiles in NTS patients corresponded to changes in the expression of enzymes  involved in SC lipid processing. The observed changes in lipid composition,  lipid organization, and enzyme expression are likely to contribute to the  barrier dysfunction in NTS.', 'The mechanism of membrane permeabilization by dermcidin (DCD-1L), an  antimicrobial peptide present in human sweat, was investigated at a  mercury-supported monolayer of dioleoylphosphatidylcholine (DOPC) or  dioleoylphosphatidylserine (DOPS) and at a mercury-supported tethered bilayer  lipid membrane (tBLM) consisting of a thiolipid (DPTL) with a DOPC or DOPS  monolayer self-assembled on top of it. In an unbuffered solution of pH 5.4,  DCD-1L is almost neutral and permeabilizes a DPTL/DOPS tBLM at transmembrane  potentials, ϕtrans, which are physiological. In a pH 7 buffer solution DCD-1L  bears two negative charges and has no effect on a DPTL/DOPC tBLM, whereas it  permeabilizes a DPTL/DOPS tBLM only outside the physiological ϕtrans range;  however, the presence of zinc ion induces DCD-1L to permeabilize the DPTL/DOPS  tBLM at physiological ϕtrans values. The effect of zinc ions suggests a DCD-1L  conformation with its positive N-terminus embedded in the lipid bilayer and the  negative C terminus floating on the membrane surface. This conformation can be  stabilized by a zinc ion bridge between the His(38) residue of the C terminus  and the carboxyl group of DOPS. Chronocoulometric potential jumps from ϕtrans ≅  +160 mV to sufficiently negative values yield charge transients exhibiting a  sigmoidal shape preceded by a relatively long ""foot"". This behavior is  indicative of ion-channel formation characterized by disruption of DCD-1L  clusters adsorbed on top of the lipid bilayer, incorporation of the resulting  monomers and their aggregation into hydrophilic pores by a mechanism of  nucleation and growth.', 'Macrophage foam cell formation in vitro requires uptake of modified low density  lipoproteins (LDL) such as acetylated LDL (AcLDL) and moderately oxidized LDL  (OxLDL). Macrophages incubated with AcLDL and OxLDL, but not LDL, showed  increased membrane ruffling as seen with time-lapse phase contrast video light  microscopy. Modified LDLs stimulated circular membrane ruffles between 2 and 10  min after incubation. These membrane ruffles were readsorbed into the plasma  membrane between 5 and 15 min later. Phase-bright macropinosomes formed at the  base of the stimulated membrane ruffles. The fluid-phase marker lucifer yellow  labeled the modified LDL stimulated macropinosomes. Modified LDLs stimulate  fluid-phase uptake by 1.5-fold to threefold as measured with 14C-sucrose uptake.  Transmission electron microscopy showed that gold conjugated AcLDL and OxLDL  bound preferentially to membrane ruffles and were present in macropinosomes  (diameter >0.2 pm) underneath these membrane ruffles. AcLDL and OxLDL were also  present in clathrin-coated pits and endosomes. These studies suggest that  modified lipoproteins stimulate macropinocytosis. AcLDL and OxLDL are partially  internalized by macropinocytosis and partially internalized via clathrin-coated  pit endocytosis.', 'PURPOSE: Caveolae are cholesterol and sphingolipids rich subcellular domains on  plasma membrane. Caveolae contain a variety of signaling proteins which provide  platforms for signaling transduction. In addition to enriched with cholesterol  and sphingolipids, caveolae also contain a variety of fatty acids. It has been  well-established that acylation of protein plays a pivotal role in subcellular  location including targeting to caveolae. However, the fatty acid compositions  of caveolae and the type of acylation of caveolar proteins remain largely  unknown. In this study, we investigated the fatty acids in caveolae and  caveolin-1 bound fatty acids. METHODS: Caveolae were isolated from Chinese hamster ovary (CHO) cells. The  caveolar fatty acids were extracted with Folch reagent, methyl esterificated  with BF3, and analyzed by gas chromatograph-mass spectrometer (GC/MS). The  caveolin-1 bound fatty acids were immunoprecipitated by anti-caveolin-1 IgG and  analyzed with GC/MS. RESULTS: In contrast to the whole CHO cell lysate which contained a variety of  fatty acids, caveolae mainly contained three types of fatty acids, 0.48 µg  palmitic acid, 0.61 µg stearic acid and 0.83 µg oleic acid/caveolae  preparation/5 × 10(7) cells. Unexpectedly, GC/MS analysis indicated that  caveolin-1 was not acylated by myristic acid; instead, it was acylated by  palmitic acid and stearic acid. CONCLUSION: Caveolae contained a special set of fatty acids, highly enriched  with saturated fatty acids, and caveolin-1 was acylated by palmitic acid and  stearic acid. The unique fatty acid compositions of caveolae and acylation of  caveolin-1 may be important for caveolae formation and for maintaining the  function of caveolae.', ""In a distinct autosomal recessive variant of epidermolysis bullosa, EB-MD,  life-long skin blistering is associated with late-onset muscular dystrophy of  unknown etiology. Electron microscopy of these patients' skin suggests that  tissue separation occurs intracellularly at the level of the hemidesmosomal  inner plaque, which contains plectin, a high molecular weight cytoskeletal  associated protein, also expressed in the sarcolemma of the muscle. In this  study, we report two patients with EB-MD, each with a homozygous deletion  mutation in the plectin gene, PLEC1. In the first case, the proband and her  similarly affected sister had a homozygous 9 bp deletion mutation, designated as  2719de19, which resulted in elimination of three amino acids, QEA, in a sequence  of 23 amino acids entirely conserved between the mouse and human sequences. The  proband in the second family demonstrated a single nucleotide deletion at  position 5866, designated as 5866delC, which resulted in frameshift and a  premature termination codon for translation 16 bp downstream from the site of  deletion. The absence of plectin in the hemidesmosomes, as reflected by negative  immunofluorescence with an anti-plectin antibody (HD-1), associated with  fragility of basal keratinocytes, implicates plectin as critical for binding of  intermediate keratin filament network to hemidesmosomal complexes. The function  of plectin as a putative attachment protein also in the muscle would explain the  clinical phenotype consisting of cutaneous fragility and muscular dystrophy in  EB-MD.""]","Here, we demonstrate that charge-mediated phase separation, or complex coacervation, of RNAs with cationic peptides can generate simple model liquid organelles capable of reversibly compartmentalizing biomolecules.

193,Which receptors can be evaluated with the [18F]altanserin?,"['Serotonin (5-hydroxytryptamine, 5-HT) has diverse physiological roles as a  neurotransmitter in the central nervous system (1). It is involved in the  regulation and modulation of sleep, affective and personality behaviors, and  pain. It also is a regulator of smooth muscle function and platelet aggregation.  The brain cortical 5-HT system has been implicated in several neuropsychiatric  disorders, including major depression, anxiety, obsessive-compulsive disorder,  and schizophrenia (2, 3). The effects of 5-HT are mediated by as many as seven  classes of receptor populations (5-HT1 to 5-HT7), many of which include several  subtypes (4). There are three receptor subtypes within the G-protein–coupled  5-HT2 receptor family: 5-HT2A, 5-HT2B, and 5-HT2C. 5-HT2A receptors are  abundantly present in the cerebral cortex, basal forebrain, hippocampus,  amygdala, dorsal thalamus, hypothalamus, superior colliculus, substantia nigra,  pedunculopontine nucleus, legmental area, and myelencephalon (5). 5-HT2A  receptors are involved in mediation of normal and psychotic states, working  memory, regulation of GABAergic and cholinergic neuronal cells, sleep,  peripheral pain, and cardiovascular functions. 5-HT2B receptors are found mainly  in several peripheral tissues, such as the stomach, intestine, pulmonary smooth  muscle, and myocardium. In the brain, 5-HT2B receptors are found in discrete  nuclei of the cerebellum, lateral septum, dorsal hypothalamus, dorsal raphe, and  amygdala. 5-HT2C receptors are found in the choroid plexus, substantia nigra,  globus pallidus, and ventromedial thalamus. 5-HT2A receptors are implicated in  several psychiatric disorders, such as schizophrenia, depression, and  obsessive-compulsive disorder. Thus, there is a need for selective ligands to  investigate the pharmacological role of 5-HT2A receptors. There have been  several studies to develop specific 5-HT2A radioligands, such as [11C]ketanserin  (6), [18F]spiperone (7), [11C]methylspiperone ([11C]NMSP), and [18F]setoperone  [PubMed], for positron emission tomography (8) imaging. However, none of these  ligands has proven to be specific for 5-HT2A receptors because these compounds  also bind to other receptors, such as dopamine receptors and the 5-HT1 receptor  subtypes. Altanserin, a fluorobenzoyl derivative related to ketanserin, was  reported to be a potent antagonist of 5-HT2A receptors with >100-fold  selectivity over D2/3 receptors, 5-HT1A, 5-HT6, and 5-HT7 (9, 10). This led to  the development of  3-{2-[4-(4-[18F]fluorobenzoyl)-1-piperidyl]ethyl}-2-sulfanyl-3H-quinazolin-4-one  ([18F]altanserin) as a useful tool for 5-HT2A receptor PET imaging in vivo (11).  5-HT2A antagonists bind to the total pool of receptors, whereas 5-HT2A agonists  bind only to the high-affinity functional state of the receptor but may be more  important in disease states because the high affinity sites are the ones that  transmit the intracellular signals. Furthermore,  2-(4-Iodo-2,5-dimethoxyphenyl)-N-(2-[11C]methoxybenzyl)ethanamine  ([11C]CIMBI-5), a potent and selective 5-HT2A agonist, has been developed as a  tool for studying 5-HT2A agonist binding in the brain (12).', 'Serotonin (5-hydroxytryptamine, 5-HT) has diverse physiological roles as a  neurotransmitter in the central nervous system (1).

Successful inhibition of a prepotent response in 'NoGo' paradigms  requires the integrity of both the inferior frontal gyrus (IFG) and the  serotonergic system. We investigated individual differences in serotonergic  regulation of response inhibition. In 24 healthy adults, we used  (18)F-altanserin positron emission tomography to assess cerebral 5-HT2A  receptors, which have been related to impulsivity. We then investigated the  impact of two acute manipulations of brain serotonin levels on behavioral and  neural correlates of inhibition using intravenous citalopram and acute  tryptophan depletion during functional magnetic resonance imaging. We adapted  the NoGo paradigm to isolate effects on inhibition per se as opposed to other  aspects of the NoGo paradigm. Successful NoGo inhibition was associated with  greater activation of the right IFG compared to control trials with alternative  responses, indicating that the IFG is activated with inhibition in NoGo trials  rather than other aspects of invoked cognitive control. Activation of the left  IFG during NoGo trials was greater with citalopram than acute tryptophan  depletion. Moreover, with the NoGo-type of response inhibition, the right IFG  displayed an interaction between the type of serotonergic challenge and  neocortical 5-HT2A receptor binding. Specifically, acute tryptophan depletion  (ATD) produced a relatively larger NoGo response in the right IFG in subjects  with low 5-HT2A BPP but reduced the NoGo response in those with high 5-HT2A BPP.  These links between serotonergic function and response inhibition in healthy  subjects may help to interpret serotonergic abnormalities underlying impulsivity  in neuropsychiatric disorders."", 'The aim of the present study was to develop an experimental paradigm for the  study of serotonergic neurotransmission in humans using positron emission  tomography and the 5-HT2A selective radioligand [18F]altanserin. [18F]altanserin  studies were conducted in seven subjects using the bolus/infusion approach  designed for attaining steady state in blood and brain 2 hours after the initial  [18F]altanserin administration. Three hours after commencement of radiotracer  administration, 0.25 mg/kg of the selective serotonin reuptake inhibitor,  citalopram (Lundbeck, Valby, Denmark), was administered to all subjects as a  constant infusion for 20 minutes. To reduce 5-HT1A-mediated autoinhibition of  cortical 5-HT release, four of the seven subjects were pretreated with the  partial 5-HT1A agonist pindolol for 3 days at an increasing oral dose (25 mg on  the day of scanning). In each subject, the baseline condition (120 to 180  minutes) was compared with the stimulated condition (195 to 300 minutes).  Despite a pronounced increase in plasma prolactin and two subjects reporting hot  flushes compatible with an 5-HT-induced adverse effect, cortical [18F]altanserin  binding was insensitive to the citalopram challenge, even after pindolol  pretreatment. The biochemical and cellular events possibly affecting the  unsuccessful translation of the citalopram/pindolol challenge into a change in  5-HT2A receptor binding of [18F]altanserin are discussed.', ""Numerous studies indicate that the serotonergic (5-HT) transmitter system is  involved in the regulation of impulsive aggression and there is from  post-mortem, in vivo imaging and genetic studies evidence that the 5-HT2A  receptor may be involved. We investigated 94 healthy individuals (60 men, mean  age 47.0±18.7, range 23-86) to determine if trait aggression and trait  impulsivity were related to frontal cortex 5-HT2A receptor binding (5-HT2AR) as  measured with [18F]-altanserin PET imaging. Trait aggression and trait  impulsivity were assessed with the Buss-Perry Aggression Questionnaire (AQ) and  the Barratt Impulsiveness Scale 11 (BIS-11). Statistical analyses were conducted  using a multiple linear regression model and internal consistency reliability of  the AQ and BIS-11 was evaluated by Cronbach's alpha. Contrary to our hypothesis,  results revealed no significant associations between 5-HT2AR and the AQ or  BIS-11 total scores. Also, there was no significant interaction between gender  and frontal cortex 5-HT2AR in predicting trait aggression and trait impulsivity.  This is the first study to examine how 5-HT2AR relates to trait aggression and  trait impulsivity in a large sample of healthy individuals.

PROCEDURES: Ten Sprague Dawley rats underwent 180 min PET scans with arterial  blood sampling. Reference tissue methods were evaluated on the basis of invasive  kinetic models with metabolite-corrected arterial input functions. In vivo  5-HT2AR quantification with PET was validated by in vitro autoradiographic  saturation experiments in the same animals. RESULT: Overall brain uptake of [18F]altanserin was reliably quantified by  invasive and non-invasive models with the cerebellum as reference region shown  by linear correlation of outcome parameters. Unlike in humans, no lipophilic  metabolites occurred so that brain activity derived solely from parent compound.  PET data correlated very well with in vitro autoradiographic data of the same  animals. CONCLUSION: [18F]Altanserin PET is a reliable tool for in vivo quantification of  5-HT2AR availability in albino rats. Models based on both blood input and  reference tissue describe radiotracer kinetics adequately. Low cerebral tracer  uptake might, however, cause restrictions in experimental usage.', 'The vulnerability to mood disorders, impulsive-aggression, eating disorders, and  suicidal behavior varies greatly with gender, and may reflect gender differences  in central serotonergic function. We investigated the relationships of gender,  mood, impulsivity, aggression and temperament to 5HT(2A) receptor binding in 21  healthy subjects using [18F]altanserin and PET neuroimaging. Binding potentials  in pre-defined regions-of-interest (ROI) were calculated using the Logan  graphical method, corrected for partial volume effects, and compared by gender  with age co-varied. SPM analysis was used for voxel level comparisons.  Altanserin binding (BP(P)) was greater in male than female subjects in the  following nine ROIs: hippocampus (HIP) and Lt. HIP, lateral orbital frontal  cortex (LOF) and Lt. LOF, left medial frontal cortex (Lt. MFC), left medial  temporal cortex (Lt. MTC), left occipital cortex (Lt. OCC), thalamus (THL) and  Lt. THL. Differences in Lt. HIP and Lt. MTL remained significant after  Bonferroni correction. Gender differences were noted in the co-variation of  psychological traits with BP(P) values in specific ROIs. Among males alone,  aggression was negatively correlated with BP(P) values in Lt. LOF and Lt. MFC,  and Suspiciousness positively correlated in LOF, Lt. LOF and Lt. MFC. Among  female subjects alone, Negativism was positively correlated with BP(P) values in  HIP, and Verbal Hostility in Lt. HIP. Altanserin binding in Lt. MTC was  positively correlated with Persistence, with no significant gender effect.  Gender differences in 5HT(2A) receptor function in specific ROIs may mediate  expression of psychological characteristics such as aggression, suspiciousness  and negativism. Future studies of 5HT(2A) receptor function and its relationship  to behavior should control for gender.', 'INTRODUCTION: The selective 5-hydroxytryptamine type 2a receptor (5-HT(2A)R)  radiotracer [(18)F]altanserin is a promising ligand for in vivo brain imaging in  rodents. However, [(18)F]altanserin is a substrate of P-glycoprotein (P-gp) in  rats. Its applicability might therefore be constrained by both a differential  expression of P-gp under pathological conditions, e.g. epilepsy, and its  relatively low cerebral uptake. The aim of the present study was therefore  twofold: (i) to investigate whether inhibition of multidrug transporters (MDT)  is suitable to enhance the cerebral uptake of [(18)F]altanserin in vivo and (ii)  to test different pharmacokinetic, particularly reference tissue-based models  for exact quantification of 5-HT(2A)R densities in the rat brain. METHODS: Eighteen Sprague-Dawley rats, either treated with the MDT inhibitor  cyclosporine A (CsA, 50 mg/kg, n=8) or vehicle (n=10) underwent 180-min PET  scans with arterial blood sampling. Kinetic analyses of tissue time-activity  curves (TACs) were performed to validate invasive and non-invasive  pharmacokinetic models. RESULTS: CsA application lead to a two- to threefold increase of  [(18)F]altanserin uptake in different brain regions and showed a trend toward  higher binding potentials (BP(ND)) of the radioligand. CONCLUSIONS: MDT inhibition led to an increased cerebral uptake of  [(18)F]altanserin but did not improve the reliability of BP(ND) as a  non-invasive estimate of 5-HT(2A)R. This finding is most probable caused by the  heterogeneous distribution of P-gp in the rat brain and its incomplete blockade  in the reference region (cerebellum). Differential MDT expressions in  experimental animal models or pathological conditions are therefore likely to  influence the applicability of imaging protocols and have to be carefully  evaluated.', 'Although alterations of serotonin (5-HT) system functioning have been proposed  for a variety of psychiatric disorders, a direct method quantitatively assessing  5-HT release capacity in the living human brain is still lacking. Therefore, we  evaluated a novel method to assess 5-HT release capacity in vivo using  dexfenfluramine challenge and [(18)F]altanserin positron emission tomography  (PET). Thirteen healthy male subjects received placebo and single oral doses of  40 mg (n = 6) or 60 mg (n = 7) of the potent 5-HT releaser dexfenfluramine  separated by an interval of 14 days. Three further subjects received placebo on  both days. Two hours after placebo/drug administration, 250 MBq of the 5-HT(2A)  receptor selective PET-radiotracer [(18)F]altanserin was administered  intravenously as a 30s bolus. Dynamic PET data were subsequently acquired over  90 min. Moreover, arterial blood samples were drawn for measurement of total  activity and metabolite correction of the input function. Dexfenfluramine as  well as cortisol and prolactin plasma concentration-time profiles was  quantitatively determined. Tracer distribution volumes for five  volumes-of-interest (prefrontal and occipital cortex, insula, thalamus,  caudatum) were calculated by the Logan plot and a 2-tissue compartment model.  Dexfenfluramine dose-dependently decreased the total distribution volume of  [(18)F]altanserin in cortical regions independent of the PET modeling approach.  Cortisol and prolactin plasma concentrations were dose-dependently increased by  dexfenfluramine. The decrease in cortical [(18)F]altanserin receptor binding  under dexfenfluramine was correlated with the increase of plasma prolactin.  These data suggest that the combination of a dexfenfluramine-induced 5-HT  release and subsequent assessment of 5-HT(2A) receptor availability with  [(18)F]altanserin PET is suitable to measure cortical 5-HT release capacity in  the human brain.', 'PURPOSE: The serotonin 2A (5-HT(2A)) receptor is of interest in several  psychiatric and neurological diseases. In the present study we investigated the  longitudinal stability of 5-HT(2A) receptors and the stability of the  quantification procedure in the elderly in order to be able to study elderly  patients with neuropsychiatric diseases on a longitudinal basis. METHODS: [(18)F]-Altanserin PET was used to quantify 5-HT(2A) receptors in 12  healthy elderly individuals at baseline and at 2 years in six volumes of  interest. A bolus/infusion protocol was used to achieve the binding potential,  BP(P). The reproducibility as assessed in terms of variability and the  reliability as assessed in terms of intraclass correlation coefficient (ICC)  were used to compare inter- and intraobserver stability and to evaluate the  effects of increasing complexity of partial volume (PV) corrections. We also  compared the stability of our measurements over 2 years with the stability of  data from an earlier study with 2-week test-retest measurements. RESULTS: BP(P) was unaltered at follow-up without the use of PV correction and  when applying two-tissue PV correction, test-retest reproducibility was 12-15%  and reliability 0.45-0.67 in the large bilateral regions such as the parietal,  temporal, occipital and frontal cortices, while orbitofrontal and anterior  cingulate cortical regions were less stable. The use of PV correction decreased  the variability but also decreased the between-subject variation, thereby  worsening the reliability. CONCLUSION: In healthy elderly individuals, brain 5-HT(2A) receptor binding  remains stable over 2 years, and acceptable reproducibility and reliability in  larger regions and high intra- and interobserver stability allow the use of  [(18)F]-altanserin in longitudinal studies of patients with neuropsychiatric  disorders.']",5-HT2A (5-hydroxytryptamine type 2a) receptor can be evaluated with the [18F]altanserin.
194,How can B-cells transdifferentiate into macrophages?,"['Experimental perturbation of signaling or transcription factor networks has been  used to study the developmental potential of lymphoid progenitors,  lineage-committed precursors and mature lymphocytes. Common lymphoid progenitors  and uncommitted pro-T cells can be efficiently diverted into myeloid or  erythroid lineages by ectopic cytokine signaling or retroviral expression of the  myeloid C/EBPalpha or erythroid GATA1 transcription factor. Forced C/EBPalpha  expression furthermore induces direct transdifferentiation of immature  thymocytes or B cells into macrophages. Notably, conditional inactivation of the  B cell commitment factor Pax5 is sufficient to convert mature B cells into  functional T cells via dedifferentiation to uncommitted progenitors. Together  these experiments have uncovered an unanticipated developmental plasticity of  lymphocytes, which may account for lineage switches observed in human  malignancies.', 'The generation of induced pluripotent stem cells (iPSCs) achieved by  overexpression of Oct4, Sox2, Klf4 and c-Myc, transformed our classical views of  the cellular epigenetic landscape and delivered a new concept for cell and  tissue engineering. In addition to iPSCs, several other cell types have also  been generated by master transcription factor (TF)-mediated  transdifferentiation. However, the critical molecular mechanisms amongst diverse  cellular identity changes are not well understood. Through the investigation of  reprogramming mechanisms, we recently revealed that over-expression of  constitutive active Smad3 boosted not only iPSC generation, but also 3 other  master TF-mediated conversions, from B cells to macrophages, myoblasts to  adipocytes, and human fibroblasts to neurons. This demonstrated that there were  common mechanisms underlying different master TF-mediated cell conversions. To  illuminate such mechanisms further, we have recently performed  CRISPR/Cas9-mediated genome-wide knockout screening during reprogramming with a  lentiviral gRNA library containing 90,000 gRNAs. This screening provided us with  ~15 novel reprogramming roadblock genes as well as ~20 candidate genes essential  for the reprogramming process but not for ES cell self-renewal. This data set  will be a valuable resource to further understand how overexpression of master  TFs alters cellular identity, and to achieve more faithful, efficient cell  conversions for regenerative medicine.(Presented at the 1934th Meeting, March  17, 2017).', 'The methylcytosine hydroxylase Tet2 has been implicated in hematopoietic  differentiation and the formation of myeloid malignancies when mutated. An ideal  system to study the role of Tet2 in myelopoeisis is CEBPα-induced  transdifferentiation of pre-B cells into macrophages. Here we found that CEBPα  binds to upstream regions of Tet2 and that the gene becomes activated. Tet2  knockdowns impaired the upregulation of macrophage markers as well as phagocytic  capacity, suggesting that the enzyme is required for both early and late stage  myeloid differentiation. A slightly weaker effect was seen in primary cells with  a Tet2 ablation. Expression arrays of transdifferentiating cells with Tet2  knockdowns permitted the identification of a small subset of myeloid genes whose  upregulation was blunted. Activation of these target genes was accompanied by  rapid increases of promoter hydroxy-methylation. Our observations indicate that  Tet2 helps CEBPα rapidly derepress myeloid genes during the conversion of pre-B  cells into macrophages.', 'Accumulating evidence suggests that Pax5 plays essential roles in B cell lineage  commitment. However, molecular mechanisms of B cell-specific expression of Pax5  are not fully understood. Here, we applied insertional chromatin  immunoprecipitation (iChIP) combined with stable isotope labeling using amino  acids in cell culture (SILAC) (iChIP-SILAC) to direct identification of proteins  interacting with the promoter region of the endogenous single-copy chicken Pax5  gene. By comparing B cells with macrophage-like cells trans-differentiated by  ectopic expression of C/EBPβ, iChIP-SILAC detected B cell-specific interaction  of a nuclear protein, Thy28/Thyn1, with the Pax5 1A promoter.  Trans-differentiation of B cells into macrophage-like cells caused  down-regulation of Thy28 expression. Loss-of-function of Thy28 induced decrease  in Pax5 expression and recruitment of myosin-9 (MYH9), one of Thy28-interacting  proteins, to the Pax5 1A promoter. Loss-of-function of MYH9 also induced  decrease in Pax5 expression. Thus, our analysis revealed that Thy28 is  functionally required for B cell-specific expression of Pax5 via recruitment of  MYH9 to the Pax5 locus in chicken B cells.', 'MicroRNAs (miRNAs) exert negative effects on gene expression and influence cell  lineage choice during hematopoiesis. C/EBPa-induced pre-B cell-to-macrophage  transdifferentiation provides an excellent model to investigate the contribution  of miRNAs to hematopoietic cell identity, especially because the two cell types  involved fall into separate lymphoid and myeloid branches. In this process,  efficient repression of the B cell-specific program is essential to ensure  transdifferentation and macrophage function. miRNA profiling revealed that  upregulation of miRNAs is highly predominant compared with downregulation and  that C/EBPa directly regulates several upregulated miRNAs. We also determined  that miRNA 34a (miR-34a) and miR-223 sharply accelerate C/EBPa-mediated  transdifferentiation, whereas their depletion delays this process. These two  miRNAs affect the transdifferentiation efficiency and activity of macrophages,  including their lipopolysaccharide (LPS)-dependent inflammatory response.  miR-34a and miR-223 directly target and downregulate the lymphoid transcription  factor Lef1, whose ectopic expression delays transdifferentiation to an extent  similar to that seen with miR-34a and miR-223 depletion. In addition, ectopic  introduction of Lef1 in macrophages causes upregulation of B cell markers,  including CD19, Pax5, and Ikzf3. Our report demonstrates the importance of these  miRNAs in ensuring the erasure of key B cell transcription factors, such as  Lef1, and reinforces the notion of their essential role in fine-tuning the  control required for establishing cell identity.', 'The clearest evidence that B cells play an important role in human autoimmunity  is that immunotherapies that deplete B cells are very effective treatments for  many autoimmune diseases. All people, healthy or ill, have autoreactive B cells,  but not at the same frequency. A number of genes influence the level of these  autoreactive B cells and whether they are eliminated or not during development  at a central checkpoint in the bone marrow (BM) or at a later checkpoint in  peripheral lymphoid tissues. These genes include those encoding proteins that  regulate signaling through the B-cell receptor complex such as Btk and PTPN22,  proteins that regulate innate signaling via Toll-like receptors (TLRs) such as  MyD88 and interleukin-1 receptor-associated kinase 4, as well as the gene  encoding the activation-induced deaminase (AID) essential for B cells to undergo  class switch recombination and somatic hypermutation. Recent studies have  revealed that TLR signaling elements and AID function not only in peripheral B  cells to help mediate effective antibody responses to foreign antigens, but also  in the BM to help remove autoreactive B-lineage cells at a very early point in  B-cell development. Newly arising B cells that leave the BM and enter the blood  and splenic red pulp can express both AID and TLR signaling elements like TLR7,  and thus are fully equipped to respond rapidly to antigens (including  autoantigens), to isotype class switch, and to undergo somatic hypermutation.  These red pulp B cells may thus be an important source of autoantibody-producing  cells arising particularly in extrafollicular sites, and indeed may be as  significant a source of autoantibody-producing cells as B cells arising from  germinal centers.', 'Macropinocytosis has received increasing attention in recent years for its  various roles in nutrient acquisition, immune surveillance, and virus and cancer  pathologies. In most cases macropinocytosis is initiated by the sudden increase  in an external stimulus such as a growth factor. This ""induced"" form of  macropinocytosis has been the subject of much of the work addressing its  mechanism and function over the years. An alternative, ""constitutive"" form of  macropinocytosis restricted to primary innate immune cells also exists, although  its mechanism has remained severely understudied. This mini-review focuses on  the very recent advances that have shed new light on the initiation, formation  and functional relevance of constitutive macropinocytosis in primary innate  immune cells. An emphasis is placed on how this new understanding of  constitutive macropinocytosis is helping to define the sentinel function of  innate immune cells including polarized macrophages and dendritic cells.', 'The design and evaluation of therapies for the sickle cell and beta-thalassemia  syndromes rely on our understanding of hemoglobin accumulation during human  erythropoiesis. Here we report direct measurements of hemoglobin composition and  messenger RNA (mRNA) levels in cultured CD34(+) cells and correlate those  measurements with studies of freshly obtained bone marrow samples. Hemoglobin  levels in differentiating cells were also compared with morphologic,  immunophenotypic, and cell cycle assessments. A population of large  preproerythroblasts was first identified within 24 hours and became the dominant  population by day 5. The transition from proerythroblast to basophilic  normoblast occurred later, from days 7 to 9, and correlated with a peak of 74.1%  +/- 3.9% of the cells in the S phase of cell cycle. Orthochromatic normoblasts  were the dominant and final cell type by day 13. High-performance liquid  chromatography-based quantitation of fetal (HbF) and adult (HbA) hemoglobin and  real-time polymerase chain reaction globin mRNA quantitation demonstrated a  coordinate rise in the accumulation of both proteins and mRNA among these  developmentally staged populations. Quantitative analyses on freshly sorted bone  marrow populations demonstrated a similar rising pattern with beta-globin and  HbA as the dominant species at both early and late stages of differentiation. We  found no evidence for HbF dominant populations or switching during  differentiation in adult cells. Instead, rapid increases in both HbF  (heterocellular) and HbA (pancellular) content were observed, which coincided  with the apex in cell cycling and the proerythroblast-basophilic normoblast  transition. Based on these measurements, we conclude that HbF and HbA content  are regulated with the rate of proliferation during adult erythropoiesis.', 'Previously, we reported that fluid-phase endocytosis of native LDL by  PMA-activated human monocytederived macrophages converted these macrophages into  cholesterol-enriched foam cells (Kruth, H. S., Huang, W., Ishii, I., and Zhang,  W. Y. (2002) J. Biol. Chem. 277, 34573-34580). Uptake of fluid by cells can  occur either by micropinocytosis within vesicles (<0.1 microm diameter) or by  macropinocytosis within vacuoles ( approximately 0.5-5.0 microm) named  macropinosomes. The current investigation has identified macropinocytosis as the  pathway for fluid-phase LDL endocytosis and determined signaling and  cytoskeletal components involved in this LDL endocytosis. The  phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase inhibitor, LY294002, which inhibits  macropinocytosis but does not inhibit micropinocytosis, completely blocked  PMA-activated macrophage uptake of fluid and LDL. Also, nystatin and filipin,  inhibitors of micropinocytosis from lipid-raft plasma membrane domains, both  failed to inhibit PMA-stimulated macrophage cholesterol accumulation. Time-lapse  video phase-contrast microscopy and time-lapse digital confocal-fluorescence  microscopy with fluorescent DiI-LDL showed that PMA-activated macrophages took  up LDL in the fluid phase by macropinocytosis. Macropinocytosis of LDL depended  on Rho GTPase signaling, actin, and microtubules. Bafilomycin A1, the vacuolar  H+-ATPase inhibitor, inhibited degradation of LDL and caused accumulation of  undegraded LDL within macropinosomes and multivesicular body endosomes. LDL in  multivesicular body endosomes was concentrated >40-fold over its concentration  in the culture medium consistent with macropinosome shrinkage by maturation into  multivesicular body endosomes. Macropinocytosis of LDL taken up in the fluid  phase without receptor-mediated binding of LDL is a novel endocytic pathway that  generates macrophage foam cells. Macropinocytosis in macrophages and possibly  other vascular cells is a new pathway to target for modulating foam cell  formation in atherosclerosis.', 'We have previously reported that apolipoprotein E (apoE), a protein component of  very-low-density lipoproteins (VLDL) and high-density lipoproteins and a potent  plasma-borne atheroprotective factor, exerts anti-inflammatory activity in  macrophages by switching the activation profile from M1 (""classic"") to M2  (""alternative"") in a process involving signaling via low-density lipoprotein  receptor (LDLR) family members including the VLDL receptor (VLDLR) or apoE  receptor-2 (apoER2). The present study was undertaken to investigate whether  LDLR-related protein 1 (LRP-1), another member of the LDLR family and a  ubiquitously expressed multifunctional cell surface receptor, modulates M1→M2  conversion in murine macrophages. We investigate bone marrow or peritoneal  macrophages isolated from wild-type C57/Bl6 mice or mice with conditional  inactivation of the LRP-1 gene in the myeloid lineage for the expression of  polarization markers. Our results suggest that the deficiency of LRP-1  down-regulates M2 marker expression in macrophages, while enhancing the  macrophage response to M1 stimuli. To our knowledge, this is the first  demonstration that LRP-1 affects macrophage polarization and promotes the  development of an anti-inflammatory M2 functional phenotype.']",Inflammatory macrophages can transdifferentiate into myofibroblasts during renal fibrosis .

195,What is the name of Bruton's tyrosine kinase inhibitor that can be used for treatment of chronic lymphocytic leukemia?,"[""Normal B lymphocytes receive signals from B-cell antigen receptor (BCR) that are  triggered by binding of the BCR to an external antigen. Tonic signaling through  the BCR provides growth and signals to chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL) cells,  and plays an important role in the pathogenesis and progression of the disease.  Antigen engagement of BCR is followed by intracellular recruitment and  activation of BCR-associated kinases including spleen tyrosine kinase (Syk),  Bruton's tyrosine kinase (Btk) and phosphatidylinositol 3-kinases (PI3K).  Inhibition of signaling pathways downstream of the BCR induces disruption of  chemokine-mediated CLL cell migration and cell killing. BCR signal transduction  inhibitors represent a promising new strategy for targeted CLL treatment. A  number of therapeutic agents have recently been developed with significant  activity in CLL. The compounds that are currently investigated in patients with  CLL include ibrutinib -inhibitor of Btk, fostamatinib-inhibitor of Syk and  idelalisib (GS-1101) -a specific isoform of the PI3K (PI3K) inhibitor. The  clinical activity of ibrutinib, GS-1101 and fostamatinib in patients with CLL is  associated with marked lymphocytosis due to release of tumor cells from the  lymph nodes into the peripheral blood. Further studies are ongoing with single  agents and their combinations with other targeted and conventional therapies.  This article will review the preclinical rationale of BCR signaling inhibitors  in the treatment of CLL, and the clinical evidence supporting the use of these  agents in CLL patients."", ""In chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL) signals from the B cell receptor (BCR)  play a major role in disease development and progression. In this light, new  therapies that specifically target signaling molecules downstream of the BCR  continue to be developed. While first studies on the selective small molecule  inhibitor of Bruton's tyrosine kinase (Btk), Ibrutinib (PCI-32765), demonstrated  that Btk inhibition sensitizes CLL cells to apoptosis and alters their migratory  behavior, these studies however did not address whether Btk-mediated signaling  is involved in the process of CLL leukemogenesis. To investigate the requirement  of Btk signaling for CLL development, we modulated Btk expression in the IgH.ETμ  CLL mouse model, which is based on sporadic expression of the simian oncovirus  SV40 T-antigen in mature B cells. To this end, we crossed IgH.ETμ mice on a  Btk-deficient background or introduced a human Btk transgene (CD19-hBtk). Here  we show that Btk deficiency fully abrogates CLL formation in IgH.ETμ mice, and  that leukemias formed in Btk haplo-insufficient mice selectively expressed the  wild-type Btk allele on their active X chromosome. Conversely, Btk  overexpression accelerated CLL onset, increased mortality, and was associated  with selection of non-stereotypical BCRs into CLL clones. Taken together, these  data show that Btk expression represents an absolute prerequisite for CLL  development and that Btk mediated signaling enhances leukemogenesis in mice. We  therefore conclude that in CLL Btk expression levels set the threshold for  malignant transformation."", ""Recent clinical data suggest remarkable activity of ibrutinib, the  first-in-class covalent inhibitor of Bruton's tyrosine kinase (BTK), in chronic  lymphocytic leukemia (CLL), as well as excellent activity in other B cell  malignancies, including in particular mantle cell lymphoma and Waldenstrom  macroglobulinemia. This review evaluates the data from ongoing clinical and  correlative studies of ibrutinib in B cell malignancies with a particular focus  on CLL, and considers these data in the context of other B cell receptor pathway  inhibitors."", ""Chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL) is characterized by constitutive activation  of the B-cell receptor (BCR) signaling pathway, but variable responsiveness of  the BCR to antigen ligation. Bruton's tyrosine kinase (BTK) shows constitutive  activity in CLL and is the target of irreversible inhibition by ibrutinib, an  orally bioavailable kinase inhibitor that has shown outstanding activity in CLL.  Early clinical results in CLL with other reversible and irreversible BTK  inhibitors have been less promising, however, raising the question of whether  BTK kinase activity is an important target of ibrutinib and also in CLL. To  determine the role of BTK in CLL, we used patient samples and the Eμ-TCL1 (TCL1)  transgenic mouse model of CLL, which results in spontaneous leukemia  development. Inhibition of BTK in primary human CLL cells by small interfering  RNA promotes apoptosis. Inhibition of BTK kinase activity through either  targeted genetic inactivation or ibrutinib in the TCL1 mouse significantly  delays the development of CLL, demonstrating that BTK is a critical kinase for  CLL development and expansion and thus an important target of ibrutinib.  Collectively, our data confirm the importance of kinase-functional BTK in CLL."", ""PURPOSE OF REVIEW: Despite ongoing efforts to decipher the cancer genome,  discoveries of new targetable genetic lesions within cancer cells are rare.  Therefore, alternative approaches are needed. Signals from the microenvironment  are increasingly recognized as drivers of disease progression in hematologic and  solid cancers. Consequently, there is growing interest in targeting the  tumor-microenvironment cross-talk. This review highlights recent therapeutic  advances in targeting the microenvironment in chronic lymphocytic leukemia  (CLL). RECENT FINDINGS: CLL is the poster child for microenvironment-dependent  malignancies, because the clonal CLL B cells are highly dependent on external  signals for maintenance and expansion. These pathways recapitulate those  responsible for normal B-cell expansion in germinal centers. The most prominent,  conserved mechanism is B-cell receptor (BCR) signaling, which promotes CLL cell  survival and expansion in lymphatic tissue areas designated proliferation  centers. BCR signaling now can be targeted by new targeted kinase inhibitors. SUMMARY: Small molecule inhibitors of BCR signaling kinases, Bruton's tyrosine  kinase (Btk) inhibitor ibrutinib and the phosphoinositide 3'-kinase delta  (PI3Kδ) inhibitor GS-1101, are currently transforming the landscape of CLL  therapy. This development exemplifies that the microenvironment has become a  lively successful area of translational research."", ""Understanding the pathogenesis of CLL has uncovered a plethora of novel targets  for human application of monoclonal antibodies, engineered T cells, or  inhibitors of signal transduction pathways. The B-cell receptor signaling  pathway is being actively explored as a therapeutic target in CLL. Ibrutinib, an  inhibitor of Bruton's tyrosine kinase is showing impressive responses in heavily  pre-treated high-risk CLL, whether alone or in combination with MoAbs or  chemotherapy. Other key components of the BCR pathway, namely PI3K-δ, are also  being targeted with novel therapies with promising results as well. Future  trials would likely evaluate ibrutinib in the front-line setting. Moreover,  improvements in allogeneic HCT mostly by continuing to reduce associated  toxicity as well as incorporating cellular therapies such as autologous CLL  tumor vaccines, among others, will continue to expand. This is also the case for  the next generation of chimeric antigen receptor therapy for CLL once  genetically modified T cells are available at broad scale and with improved  efficacy. As our ability to further refine and integrate these therapies  continues to improve, and we gain further knowledge from gene sequencing, we  anticipate that treatment algorithms will continue to be revised to a more  personalized approach to treat this disease with improved efficacy and devoid of  unnecessary toxicity."", ""Protein kinases (PKs) and lipid kinases (LKs) are good choices for targets of  signal transduction therapy as these enzymes are involved in signaling pathways,  and are often related to the pathogenesis of lymphoid malignancies. The  attractiveness of PKs and LKs as drug able targets is enhanced by the fact that  they are enzymes whose biological activity can be turned off by drugs that block  their catalytic site. In the last few years small molecular kinase inhibitors  (KIs) have been synthesized and become available for preclinical studies and  clinical trials. The first KI, introduced into clinical practice in 1998, was  imatinib mesylate, which became the first choice drug in chronic myeloid  leukemia. More recently, several KIs have been developed to target the proximal  B-cell receptor (BCR) signaling pathway including spleen tyrosine kinase  inhibitor (Fostamatinib) and Bruton's tyrosine kinase inhibitors (Ibrutinib,  AVL-263). These agents are currently evaluated in early clinical trials in  chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL) and other diseases. Cyclin-dependent kinase  (Cdk) inhibitors, flavopiridol (alvocidib), BMS-387032 (SNS-032), sunitinib and  sorafenib are currently under evaluation in clinical trials for  relapsed/refractory CLL. Multi-tyrosine kinase inhibitors including vandetanib  (ZD6474) bosutinib (SKI-606), TKI258 (CHIR-258), pazopanib (GW786034) and  axitinib (AG013736) have been also developed for the treatment of lymphoid  malignancies. Phosphatidylinositol 3-kinases (PI3K ) are a family of lipid  kinases that mediate signals from cell surface receptors. CAL-101 (GS-1101) is  an oral PI3Kδ-specific inhibitor which has shown preclinical and clinical  activity against CLL. This article summarizes recent achievements in the  mechanism of action, pharmacological properties and clinical activity and  toxicity of PK and LK inhibitors in CLL."", ""INTRODUCTION: Systemic lupus erythematosus is a chronic autoimmune disease  characterized by an abundance of autoantibodies against nuclear antigens.  Bruton's tyrosine kinase (Btk) is a proximal transducer of the BCR signal that  allows for B-cell activation and differentiation. Recently, selective inhibition  of Btk by PCI-32765 has shown promise in limiting activity of multiple cells  types in various models of cancer and autoimmunity. The aim of this study was to  determine the effect of Btk inhibition by PCI-32765 on the development of lupus  in lupus-prone B6.Sle1 and B6.Sle1.Sle3 mice. METHODS: B6.Sle1 or B6.Sle1.Sle3 mice received drinking water containing either  the Btk inhibitor PCI-32765 or vehicle for 56 days. Following treatment, mice  were examined for clinical and pathological characteristics of lupus. The effect  of PCI-32765 on specific cell types was also investigated. RESULTS: In this study, we report that Btk inhibition dampens humoral  autoimmunity in B6.Sle1 monocongenic mice. Moreover, in B6.Sle1.Sle3 bicongenic  mice that are prone to severe lupus, Btk inhibition also dampens humoral and  cellular autoimmunity, as well as lupus nephritis. CONCLUSIONS: These findings suggest that partial crippling of cell signaling in  B cells and antigen presenting cells (APCs) may be a viable alternative to total  depletion of these cells as a therapeutic modality for lupus."", 'Bruton tyrosine kinase (Btk) is expressed in B-lymphocytes, myeloid cells and  platelets, and Btk-inhibitors (BTKi) are used to treat patients with B-cell  malignancies, developed against autoimmune diseases, have been proposed as novel  antithrombotic drugs, and been tested in patients with severe COVID-19. However,  mild bleeding is frequent in patients with B-cell malignancies treated with the  irreversible BTKi ibrutinib and the recently approved 2nd generation BTKi  acalabrutinib, zanubrutinib and tirabrutinib, and also in volunteers receiving  in a phase-1 study the novel irreversible BTKi BI-705564. In contrast, no  bleeding has been reported in clinical trials of other BTKi. These include the  brain-penetrant irreversible tolebrutinib and evobrutinib (against multiple  sclerosis), the irreversible branebrutinib, the reversible BMS-986142 and  fenebrutinib (targeting rheumatoid arthritis and lupus erythematodes), and the  reversible covalent rilzabrutinib (against pemphigus and immune  thrombocytopenia). Remibrutinib, a novel highly selective covalent BTKi, is  currently in clinical studies of autoimmune dermatological disorders. This  review describes twelve BTKi approved or in clinical trials. By focusing on  their pharmacological properties, targeted disease, bleeding side effects and  actions on platelets it attempts to clarify the mechanisms underlying bleeding.  Specific platelet function tests in blood might help to estimate the probability  of bleeding of newly developed BTKi.', ""Mantle cell lymphoma (MCL) is an aggressive and incurable malignant disease.  Despite of general chemotherapy, relapse and mortality are common, highlighting  the need for the development of novel targeted drugs or combination of  therapeutic regimens. Recently, several drugs that target the B-cell receptor  (BCR) signaling pathway, especially the Bruton's tyrosine kinase (BTK) inhibitor  ibrutinib, have demonstrated notable therapeutic effects in relapsed/refractory  patients, which indicate that pharmacological inhibition of BCR pathway holds  promise in MCL treatment. Here, we have developed a novel irreversible BTK  inhibitor, PLS-123, that has more potent and selective anti-tumor activity than  ibrutinib in vitro and in vivo. Using in vitro screening, we discovered that the  combination of PLS-123 and the mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR) inhibitor  everolimus exert synergistic activity in attenuating proliferation and motility  of MCL cell lines. Simultaneous inhibition of BTK and mTOR resulted in marked  induction of apoptosis and cell cycle arrest in the G1 phase, which were  accompanied by upregulation of pro-apoptotic proteins (cleaved Caspase-3,  cleaved PARP and Bax), repression of anti-apoptotic proteins (Mcl-1, Bcl-xl and  XIAP), and downregulation of regulators of the G1/S phase transition (CDK2,  CDK4, CDK6 and Cyclin D1). Gene expression profile analysis revealed  simultaneous treatment with these agents led to inhibition of the JAK2/STAT3,  AKT/mTOR signaling pathways and SGK1 expression. Finally, the anti-tumor and  pro-apoptotic activities of combination strategy have also been demonstrated  using xenograft mice models. Taken together, simultaneous suppression of BTK and  mTOR may be indicated as a potential therapeutic modality for the treatment of  MCL.""]","Ibrutinib is the covalent inhibitor of Bruton's tyrosine kinase that can be used for treatment of chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL). Ibrutinib has shown highly encouraging results in phase I/II trials in patients with treatment-naive, relapsed and refractory CLL even in the presence of high risk disease or poor prognostic markers. Ibrutinib demonstrated that Bruton's tyrosine kinase inhibition sensitizes CLL cells to apoptosis and alters their migratory behavior. Ibrutinib has excellent activity in other B cell malignancies, including in particular mantle cell lymphoma and Waldenstrom macroglobulinemia."
196,What is a ciliopathy?,"[""A group of disorders with disparate symptomatology, including congenital  cerebellar ataxia, retinal blindness, liver fibrosis, polycystic kidney disease,  and polydactyly, have recently been united under a single disease mechanism  called 'ciliopathies'. The ciliopathies are due to defects of the cellular  antenna known as the primary cilium, a microtubule-based extension of cellular  membranes found in nearly all cell types. Key among these ciliopathies is  Joubert syndrome, displaying ataxia, oculomotor apraxia, and mental retardation*  with a pathognomonic 'molar tooth sign' on brain magnetic resonance imaging. The  importance of ciliary function in neuronal development has been appreciated only  in the last decade with the classification of Joubert syndrome as a ciliopathy.  This, together with the identification of many of the clinical features of  ciliopathies in individuals with Joubert syndrome and the localization of  Joubert syndrome's causative gene products at or near the primary cilium, have  defined a new class of neurological disease. Cilia are involved in diverse  cellular processes including protein trafficking, photoreception, embryonic axis  patterning, and cell cycle regulation. Ciliary dysfunction can affect a single  tissue or manifest as multi-organ involvement. Ciliary defects have been  described in retinopathies such as retinitis pigmentosa and Leber congenital  amaurosis (defects in photoreceptor ciliary protein complexes), renal syndromes  with nephronophthisis and cystic dysplastic kidneys, and liver conditions such  as fibrosis and biliary cirrhosis. Recognizing the diverse presentations of the  ciliopathies and screening strategies following diagnosis is an important part  of the treatment plan of children with cilia-related disorders."", 'The ""ciliopathies"" are a newly defined group of disorders characterized by  defects in the structure or function of the cellular primary cilium. Patients  with these disorders display variably expressive fibrocystic renal disease,  retinal blindness, polydactyly, obesity, and brain dysgenesis as well as  neurocognitive impairments. Joubert syndrome is a ciliopathy defined by  cerebellar vermis hypoplasia, oculomotor apraxia, intermittent hyperventilation,  and mental retardation. Recent evidence suggests important roles for the primary  cilium in mediating a host of extracellular signaling events such as morphogen,  mitogen, homeostatic and polarity signals. Based upon the clinical features of  ciliopathies and cilia mediated signaling pathways, the data support a role for  the primary cilium in modulating neurogenesis, cell polarity, axonal guidance  and possibly adult neuronal function.', 'Publisher: Ciliopatie to choroby genetyczne spowodowane zaburzeniami w  funkcjonowaniu rzęsek, wypustek komórkowych utworzonych na bazie mikrotubul.

W tym opracowaniu przedstawiono najważniejsze mechanizmy leżące u  podstaw nieprawidłowej budowy i funkcjonowania rzęsek, a tym samym będące  przyczyną ciliopatii.', ""'Ciliopathies' are an emerging class of genetic multisystemic human disorders  that are caused by a multitude of largely unrelated genes that affect ciliary  structure/function. They are unified by shared clinical features, such as mental  retardation, cystic kidney, retinal defects and polydactyly, and by the common  localization of the protein products of these genes at or near the primary  cilium of cells. With the realization that many previously disparate conditions  are a part of this spectrum of disorders, there has been tremendous interest in  the function of cilia in developmental signaling and homeostasis. Ciliopathies  are mostly inherited as simple recessive traits, but phenotypic expressivity is  under the control of numerous genetic modifiers, putting these conditions at the  interface of simple and complex genetics. In this review, we discuss the  ever-expanding ciliopathy field, which has three interrelated goals: developing  a comprehensive understanding of genes mutated in the ciliopathies and required  for ciliogenesis; understanding how the encoded proteins work together in  complexes and networks to modulate activity and structure-function  relationships; and uncovering signaling pathways and modifier relationships."", 'BACKGROUND: Ciliopathies are a class of inherited pleiotropic genetic disorders  in which alterations in cilia assembly, maintenance, and/or function exhibit  penetrance in the multiple organ systems. Olfactory dysfunction is one such  clinical manifestation that has been shown in both patients and model organisms.  Existing therapies for ciliopathies are limited to the treatment or management  of symptoms. The last decade has seen an increase in potential curative  therapeutic options including small molecules and biologics. Recent work in  multiciliated olfactory sensory neurons has demonstrated the capacity of  targeted gene therapy to restore ciliation in terminally differentiated cells  and rescue olfactory function. This review will discuss the current  understanding of the penetrance of ciliopathies in the olfactory system.  Importantly, it will highlight both pharmacological and biological approaches,  and their potential therapeutic value in the olfactory system and other ciliated  tissues. METHODS: We undertook a structured and comprehensive search of peer-reviewed  research literature encompassing in vitro, in vivo, model organism, and clinical  studies. From these publications, we describe the olfactory system, and discuss  the penetrance of ciliopathies and impact of cilia loss on olfactory function.  In addition, we outlined the developing therapies for ciliopathies across  different organ and cell culture systems, and discussed their potential  therapeutic application to the mammalian olfactory system. RESULTS: One-hundred sixty-one manuscripts were included in the review,  centering on the understanding of olfactory penetrance of ciliopathies, and  discussing the potential therapeutic options for ciliopathies in the context of  the mammalian olfactory system. Forty-four manuscripts were used to generate a  table listing the known congenital causes of olfactory dysfunction, with the  first ten listed are linked to ciliopathies. Twenty-three manuscripts were used  to outline the potential of small molecules for the olfactory system. Emphasis  was placed on HDAC6 inhibitors and lithium, both of which were shown to  stabilize microtubule structures, contributing to ciliogenesis and cilia  lengthening. Seventy-five manuscripts were used to describe gene therapy and  gene therapeutic strategies. Included were the implementation of adenoviral,  adeno-associated virus (AAV), and lentiviral vectors to treat ciliopathies  across different organ systems and application toward the olfactory system. Thus  far, adenoviral and AAVmeditated ciliary restoration demonstrated successful  proof-of-principle preclinical studies. In addition, gene editing, ex vivo gene  therapy, and transplantation could serve as alternative therapeutic and  long-term approaches. But for all approaches, additional assessment of vector  immunogenicity, specificity, and efficacy need further investigation. Currently,  ciliopathy treatments are limited to symptomatic management with no curative  options. However, the accessibility and amenability of the olfactory system to  treatment would facilitate development and advancement of a viable therapy. CONCLUSION: The findings of this review highlight the contribution of  ciliopathies to a growing list of congenial olfactory dysfunctions. Promising  results from other organ systems imply the feasibility of biologics, with  results from gene therapies proving to be a viable therapeutic option for  ciliopathies and olfactory dysfunction.', 'The primary cilium is a well-established target in the pathogenesis of numerous  developmental and chronic disorders, and more recently is attracting interest as  a structure relevant to cancer. Here we discuss mechanisms by which changes in  cilia can contribute to the formation and growth of tumors. We emphasize the  cancer-relevance of cilia-dependent signaling pathways and proteins including  mTOR, VHL, TSC, WNT, Aurora-A, NEDD9, and Hedgehog, and highlight the emerging  role of ciliary dysfunction in renal cell carcinoma, medulloblastoma, and breast  cancer.', 'Intraflagellar transport (IFT) depends on two evolutionarily conserved modules,  subcomplexes A (IFT-A) and B (IFT-B), to drive ciliary assembly and maintenance.  All six IFT-A components and their motor protein, DYNC2H1, have been linked to  human skeletal ciliopathies, including asphyxiating thoracic dystrophy (ATD;  also known as Jeune syndrome), Sensenbrenner syndrome, and Mainzer-Saldino  syndrome (MZSDS). Conversely, the 14 subunits in the IFT-B module, with the  exception of IFT80, have unknown roles in human disease. To identify additional  IFT-B components defective in ciliopathies, we independently performed different  mutation analyses: candidate-based sequencing of all IFT-B-encoding genes in  1,467 individuals with a nephronophthisis-related ciliopathy or whole-exome  resequencing in 63 individuals with ATD. We thereby detected biallelic mutations  in the IFT-B-encoding gene IFT172 in 12 families. All affected individuals  displayed abnormalities of the thorax and/or long bones, as well as renal,  hepatic, or retinal involvement, consistent with the diagnosis of ATD or MZSDS.  Additionally, cerebellar aplasia or hypoplasia characteristic of Joubert  syndrome was present in 2 out of 12 families. Fibroblasts from affected  individuals showed disturbed ciliary composition, suggesting alteration of  ciliary transport and signaling. Knockdown of ift172 in zebrafish recapitulated  the human phenotype and demonstrated a genetic interaction between ift172 and  ift80. In summary, we have identified defects in IFT172 as a cause of complex  ATD and MZSDS. Our findings link the group of skeletal ciliopathies to an  additional IFT-B component, IFT172, similar to what has been shown for IFT-A.', 'Autosomal dominant polycystic kidney disease (ADPKD) is an inherited genetic  disorder that results in progressive renal cyst formation with ultimate loss of  renal function and other systemic disorders. These systemic disorders include  abnormalities in cardiovascular, portal, pancreatic and gastrointestinal  systems. ADPKD is considered to be among the ciliopathy diseases due to the  association with abnormal primary cilia function. In order to understand the  full course of primary cilia and its association with ADPKD, the structure,  functions and role of primary cilia have been meticulously investigated. As a  result, the focus on primary cilia has emerged to support the vital roles of  primary cilia in ADPKD. The primary cilia have been shown to have not only a  mechanosensory function but also a chemosensory function. Both structural and  functional defects in primary cilia result in cystic kidney disease and vascular  hypertension. Thus, the mechanosenory and chemosensory functions will be  analyzed in regards to ADPKD.', 'Cysts in the kidney are among the most common inherited human pathologies, and  recent research has uncovered that a defect in cilia-mediated signaling activity  is a key factor that leads to cyst formation. The cilium is a microtubule-based  organelle that is found on most cells in the mammalian body. Multiple proteins  whose functions are disrupted in cystic diseases have now been localized to the  cilium or at the basal body at the base of the cilium. Current data indicate  that the cilium can function as a mechanosensor to detect fluid flow through the  lumen of renal tubules. Flow-mediated deflection of the cilia axoneme induces an  increase in intracellular calcium and alters gene expression. Alternatively, a  recent finding has revealed that the intraflagellar transport 88/polaris  protein, which is required for cilia assembly, has an additional role in  regulating cell-cycle progression independent of its function in ciliogenesis.  Further research directed at understanding the relationship between the cilium,  cell-cycle, and cilia-mediated mechanosensation and signaling activity will  hopefully provide important insights into the mechanisms of renal cyst  pathogenesis and lead to better approaches for therapeutic intervention.', 'Mutations in genes encoding cilia proteins cause human ciliopathies, diverse  disorders affecting many tissues. Individual genes can be linked to ciliopathies  with dramatically different phenotypes, suggesting that genetic modifiers may  participate in their pathogenesis. The ciliary transition zone contains two  protein complexes affected in the ciliopathies Meckel syndrome (MKS) and  nephronophthisis (NPHP). The BBSome is a third protein complex, affected in the  ciliopathy Bardet-Biedl syndrome (BBS). We tested whether mutations in MKS, NPHP  and BBS complex genes modify the phenotypic consequences of one another in both  C. elegans and mice. To this end, we identified TCTN-1, the C. elegans ortholog  of vertebrate MKS complex components called Tectonics, as an evolutionarily  conserved transition zone protein. Neither disruption of TCTN-1 alone or  together with MKS complex components abrogated ciliary structure in C. elegans.  In contrast, disruption of TCTN-1 together with either of two NPHP complex  components, NPHP-1 or NPHP-4, compromised ciliary structure. Similarly,  disruption of an NPHP complex component and the BBS complex component BBS-5  individually did not compromise ciliary structure, but together did. As in  nematodes, disrupting two components of the mouse MKS complex did not cause  additive phenotypes compared to single mutants. However, disrupting both Tctn1  and either Nphp1 or Nphp4 exacerbated defects in ciliogenesis and  cilia-associated developmental signaling, as did disrupting both Tctn1 and the  BBSome component Bbs1. Thus, we demonstrate that ciliary complexes act in  parallel to support ciliary function and suggest that human ciliopathy  phenotypes are altered by genetic interactions between different ciliary  biochemical complexes.']","A ciliopathy is any genetic disorder that affects the cellular cilia or the cilia anchoring structures, the basal bodies, or ciliary function"
197,What is the effect of Dkk1 in Wnt signaling?,"['Embryonic stem (ES) cells give rise to mesodermal progenitors that differentiate  to hematopoietic and cardiovascular cells. The wnt signaling pathway plays  multiple roles in cardiovascular development through a network of intracellular  effectors. To monitor global changes in wnt signaling during ES cell  differentiation, we generated independent ES cell lines carrying the luciferase  gene under promoters that uniquely respond to specific wnt pathway branches. Our  results show that successive, mutually exclusive waves of noncanonical and  canonical wnt signaling precede mesoderm differentiation. Blocking the initial  noncanonical JNK/AP-1 signaling with SP60125 aborts cardiovascular  differentiation and promotes hematopoiesis, whereas interference with the  subsequent peak of canonical wnt signaling using Dkk1 has the opposite effect.  Dkk1 blockade triggers counter mechanisms that lead to delayed and extended  activation of canonical wnt signaling and mesoderm differentiation that appear  to favor the cardiomyocytic lineage at the expense of hematopoietic cells. The  cardiomyocytic yield can be further enhanced by overexpression of Wnt11 leading  to approximately 95-fold enrichment in contracting cells. Our results suggest  that the initial noncanonical wnt signaling is necessary for subsequent  activation of canonical signaling and that the latter operates under a  regulatory loop which responds to suppression with hyperactivation of  compensatory mechanisms. This model provides new insights on wnt signaling  during ES cell differentiation and points to a method to induce cardiomyocytic  differentiation without precise timing of wnt signaling manipulation. Taking  into account the heterogeneity of pluripotent cells, these findings might  present an advantage to enhance the cardiogenic potential of stem cells.', 'DKK1 is a secreted protein that antagonizes Wnt signaling and plays essential  roles in vertebrate embryogenesis including head induction, skeletal  development, and limb patterning. DKK1 is also implicated in osteoporosis,  arthritis, and cancer and represents a potential therapeutic target for the  treatment of these diseases. DKK1 is a high affinity antagonistic ligand for  LRP6, which is a Wnt coreceptor that acts together with the Frizzled serpentine  receptor to initiate Wnt signal transduction. Two different models have been  proposed to account for the mechanism by which DKK1 antagonizes LRP6 function.  One model suggests that DKK1 binding to LRP6 disrupts Wnt-induced Frizzled-LRP6  complex formation, whereas the other model proposes that DKK1 interaction with  LRP6 promotes LRP6 internalization and degradation, thereby reducing the cell  surface LRP6 level. To clarify the molecular basis of DKK1 action, we examined  how DKK1 affects the endogenous LRP6 in several mammalian cell lines including  mouse embryonic fibroblasts. Here we show that DKK1 inhibits Wnt signaling but  induces neither LRP6 down-regulation from the cell surface nor reduction of  total LRP6 protein level and that DKK1 has no effect on the rate of continuous  internalization of LRP6 and the half-life (about 4.7 h) of LRP6. We conclude  that DKK1 inhibition of LRP6 is independent of LRP6 internalization and  degradation.', 'Parathyroid hormone (PTH) suppresses Dickkopf 1 (Dkk1) expression in  osteoblasts. To determine whether this suppression is essential for PTH-mediated  Wnt signaling and bone formation, we examined mice that overexpress Dkk1 in  osteoblasts (Dkk1 mice). Dkk1 mice were osteopenic due to abnormal osteoblast  and osteoclast activity. When fed a low-calcium diet, and in two other models of  hyperparathyroidism, these mice failed to develop the peritrabecular stromal  cell response (""osteitis fibrosis"") and new bone formation seen in wild-type  mice. Despite these effects of Dkk1 overexpression, PTH still activated Wnt  signaling in Dkk1 mice and in osteoblastic cells cultured from these mice. In  cultured MC3T3E1 preosteoblastic cells, PTH dramatically suppressed Dkk1  expression, induced PKA-mediated phosphorylation of beta-catenin, and  significantly enhanced Lef1 expression. Our findings indicate that the full  actions of PTH require intact Wnt signaling but that PTH can activate the Wnt  pathway despite overexpression of Dkk1.', 'The Wnt/β-catenin pathway plays a crucial role in the pathogenesis of various  human cancers. In multiple myeloma (MM), aberrant auto-and/or paracrine  activation of canonical Wnt signaling promotes proliferation and dissemination,  while overexpression of the Wnt inhibitor Dickkopf1 (DKK1) by MM cells  contributes to osteolytic bone disease by inhibiting osteoblast differentiation.  Since DKK1 itself is a target of TCF/β-catenin mediated transcription, these  findings suggest that DKK1 is part of a negative feedback loop in MM and may act  as a tumor suppressor. In line with this hypothesis, we show here that DKK1  expression is low or undetectable in a subset of patients with advanced MM as  well as in MM cell lines. This absence of DKK1 is correlated with enhanced Wnt  pathway activation, evidenced by nuclear accumulation of β-catenin, which in  turn can be antagonized by restoring DKK1 expression. Analysis of the DKK1  promoter revealed CpG island methylation in several MM cell lines as well as in  MM cells from patients with advanced MM. Moreover, demethylation of the DKK1  promoter restores DKK1 expression, which results in inhibition of  β-catenin/TCF-mediated gene transcription in MM lines. Taken together, our data  identify aberrant methylation of the DKK1 promoter as a cause of DKK1 silencing  in advanced stage MM, which may play an important role in the progression of MM  by unleashing Wnt signaling.', 'BACKGROUND: Thymic epithelial cell (TEC) microenvironments are essential for the  recruitment of T cell precursors from the bone marrow, as well as the subsequent  expansion and selection of thymocytes resulting in a mature self-tolerant T cell  repertoire. The molecular mechanisms, which control both the initial development  and subsequent maintenance of these critical microenvironments, are poorly  defined. Wnt signaling has been shown to be important to the development of  several epithelial tissues and organs. Regulation of Wnt signaling has also been  shown to impact both early thymocyte and thymic epithelial development. However,  early blocks in thymic organogenesis or death of the mice have prevented  analysis of a role of canonical Wnt signaling in the maintenance of TECs in the  postnatal thymus. METHODOLOGY/PRINCIPAL FINDINGS: Here we demonstrate that tetracycline-regulated  expression of the canonical Wnt inhibitor DKK1 in TECs localized in both the  cortex and medulla of adult mice, results in rapid thymic degeneration  characterized by a loss of DeltaNP63(+) Foxn1(+) and Aire(+) TECs, loss of  K5K8DP TECs thought to represent or contain an immature TEC progenitor,  decreased TEC proliferation and the development of cystic structures, similar to  an aged thymus. Removal of DKK1 from DKK1-involuted mice results in full  recovery, suggesting that canonical Wnt signaling is required for the  differentiation or proliferation of TEC populations needed for maintenance of  properly organized adult thymic epithelial microenvironments. CONCLUSIONS/SIGNIFICANCE: Taken together, the results of this study demonstrate  that canonical Wnt signaling within TECs is required for the maintenance of  epithelial microenvironments in the postnatal thymus, possibly through effects  on TEC progenitor/stem cell populations. Downstream targets of Wnt signaling,  which are responsible for maintenance of these TEC progenitors may provide  useful targets for therapies aimed at counteracting age associated thymic  involution or the premature thymic degeneration associated with cancer therapy  and bone marrow transplants.', 'Embryonic stem (ES) cells give rise to mesodermal progenitors that differentiate  to hematopoietic and cardiovascular cells.

Recurrent genetic alterations in  defined genes in association with perturbations of developmental cell signaling  pathways have been associated with PDAC development and progression. Here, we  show that GATA6 contributes to pancreatic carcinogenesis during the temporal  progression of pancreatic intraepithelial neoplasia by virtue of Wnt pathway  activation. GATA6 is recurrently amplified by both quantitative-PCR and  fluorescent in-situ hybridization in human pancreatic intraepithelial neoplasia  and in PDAC tissues, and GATA6 copy number is significantly correlated with  overall patient survival. Forced overexpression of GATA6 in cancer cell lines  enhanced cell proliferation and colony formation in soft agar in vitro and  growth in vivo, as well as increased Wnt signaling. By contrast siRNA mediated  knockdown of GATA6 led to corresponding decreases in these same parameters. The  effects of GATA6 were found to be due to its ability to bind DNA, as forced  overexpression of a DNA-binding mutant of GATA6 had no effects on cell growth in  vitro or in vivo, nor did they affect Wnt signaling levels in these same cells.  A microarray analysis revealed the Wnt antagonist Dickopf-1 (DKK1) as a  dysregulated gene in association with GATA6 knockdown, and direct binding of  GATA6 to the DKK1 promoter was confirmed by chromatin immunoprecipitation and  electrophoretic mobility shift assays. Transient transfection of GATA6, but not  mutant GATA6, into cancer cell lines led to decreased DKK1 mRNA expression and  secretion of DKK1 protein into culture media. Forced overexpression of DKK1  antagonized the effects of GATA6 on Wnt signaling in pancreatic cancer cells.  These findings illustrate that one mechanism by which GATA6 promotes pancreatic  carcinogenesis is by virtue of its activation of canonical Wnt signaling via  regulation of DKK1.', ""17β-estradiol (E2 or estrogen) is an endogenous steroid hormone that is well  known to exert neuroprotection. Along these lines, one mechanism through which  E2 protects the hippocampus from cerebral ischemia is by preventing the  post-ischemic elevation of Dkk1, a neurodegenerative factor that serves as an  antagonist of the canonical Wnt signaling pathway, and simultaneously inducing  pro-survival Wnt/β-Catenin signaling in hippocampal neurons. Intriguingly, while  expression of Dkk1 is required for proper neural development, overexpression of  Dkk1 is characteristic of many neurodegenerative diseases, such as stroke,  Alzheimer's disease, Parkinson's disease, and temporal lobe epilepsy. In this  review, we will briefly summarize the canonical Wnt signaling pathway, highlight  the current literature linking alterations of Dkk1 and Wnt/β-Catenin signaling  with neurological disease, and discuss E2's role in maintaining the delicate  balance of Dkk1 and Wnt/β-Catenin signaling in the adult brain. Finally, we will  consider the implications of long-term E2 deprivation and hormone therapy on  this crucial neural pathway.

METHODS: We subjected purified plasma cells from the bone marrow of patients  with newly diagnosed multiple myeloma and control subjects to oligonucleotide  microarray profiling and biochemical and immunohistochemical analyses to  identify molecular determinants of osteolytic lesions. RESULTS: We studied 45 control subjects, 36 patients with multiple myeloma in  whom focal lesions of bone could not be detected by magnetic resonance imaging  (MRI), and 137 patients in whom MRI detected such lesions. Different patterns of  expression of 57 of approximately 10,000 genes from purified myeloma cells could  be used to distinguish the two groups of patients (P<0.001). Permutation  analysis, which adjusts the significance level to account for multiple  comparisons in the data sets, showed that 4 of these 57 genes were significantly  overexpressed by plasma cells from patients with focal lesions. One of these  genes, dickkopf 1 (DKK1), and its corresponding protein (DKK1) were studied in  detail because DKK1 is a secreted factor that has been linked to the function of  osteoblasts. Immunohistochemical analysis of bone marrow-biopsy specimens showed  that only myeloma cells contained detectable DKK1. Elevated DKK1 levels in bone  marrow plasma and peripheral blood from patients with multiple myeloma  correlated with the gene-expression patterns of DKK1 and were associated with  the presence of focal bone lesions. Recombinant human DKK1 or bone marrow serum  containing an elevated level of DKK1 inhibited the differentiation of osteoblast  precursor cells in vitro. CONCLUSIONS: The production of DKK1, an inhibitor of osteoblast differentiation,  by myeloma cells is associated with the presence of lytic bone lesions in  patients with multiple myeloma.', 'The Dvl-1 gene on chromosome 1p36 belongs to a family of highly conserved  secreted proteins which regulates embryonic induction, generation of cell  polarity and specification of cell fate through activation of Wnt signaling  pathways. Wnt signaling activates the gene encoding DVL-1; the latter suppresses  beta-catenin by promoting its degradation through enhanced inactivation of  glycogen-synthase-kinase 3 (GSK3). Here we demonstrate increased expression of  DVL-1 mRNA in over two thirds of primary cervical squamous cell cancers (11 of  15 cases) when compared to corresponding non-cancerous uterine squamous cell  tissues. In addition, we noted up-regulation of cyclin D1, a downstream effector  of Wnt signal pathway in cervical cancer. Immunohistochemical staining  demonstrated that DVL-1 protein was prominent in the cytoplasm of cancer cells  whereas it was unreactive in the surrounding normal cervical squamous cells.  These data indicate that amplification and increased expression of the DVL-1  gene may play some role in the development of a portion of human cervical  squamous cell cancer through derangement of the Wnt signaling pathway.']",Transcriptional silencing of the Wnt-antagonist DKK1 is a secreted protein that antagonizes Wnt signaling and plays essential roles in vertebrate embryogenesis.

The  cotransformation of P. tricornutum with a non-selective GUS gene together with  the selectable resistance gene has also been achieved using our new method and  found to be very efficient (up to 60%).

As a model, two lipid  formulations were used for comparison. The first formulation is made of the  cationic lipid 1,2-dioleoyl-3-trimethylammonium-propane (DOTAP) and the  zwitterionic lipid dioleoylphosphocholine (DOPC), while the second mixture is  made of the cationic 3β-[N-(N,N-dimethylaminoethane)-carbamoyl] cholesterol  (DC-Chol) and the zwitterionic helper lipid dioleoylphosphatidylethanolamine  (DOPE). Our findings indicate that lipoplexes are efficiently taken up through  fluid-phase macropinocytosis, while a less efficient uptake of LPD NPs occurs  through a combination of both macropinocytosis and clathrin-dependent pathways.  Inside the cell, both lipoplexes and LPD NPs are actively transported towards  the cell nucleus, as quantitatively addressed by spatio-temporal image  correlation spectroscopy (STICS). For each lipid formulation, LPD NPs escape  from endosomes more efficiently than lipoplexes. When cells were treated with  DOTAP-DOPC-containing systems the majority of the DNA was trapped in the  lysosome compartment, suggesting that extensive lysosomal degradation was the  rate-limiting factors in DOTAP-DOPC-mediated transfection. On the other side,  escape from endosomes is large for DC-Chol-DOPE-containing systems most likely  due to DOPE and cholesterol-like molecules, which are able to destabilize the  endosomal membrane. The lipid-dependent and structure-dependent enhancement of  transfection activity suggests that DNA is delivered to the nucleus  synergistically: the process requires both the membrane-fusogenic activity of  the nanocarrier envelope and the employment of lipid species with intrinsic  endosomal rupture ability.', 'Plant Biotechnology involves manipulation of genetic material to develop better  crops. Keeping in view the challenges being faced by humanity in terms of  shortage of food and other resources, we need to continuously upgrade the  genomic technologies and fine tune the existing methods. For efficient genetic  transformation, Agrobacterium-mediated as well as direct delivery methods have  been used successfully. However, these methods suffer from many disadvantages  especially in terms of transfer of large genes, gene complexes and gene  silencing. To overcome these problems, recently, some efforts have been made to  develop genetic transformation systems based on engineered plant chromosomes  called minichromosomes or plant artificial chromosomes. Two approaches namely,  ""top-down"" or ""bottom-up"" have been used for minichromosomes. The former  involves engineering of the existing chromosomes within a cell and the latter de  novo assembling of chromosomes from the basic constituents. While some success  has been achieved using these chromosomes as vectors for genetic transformation  in maize, however, more studies are needed to extend this technology to crop  plants. The present review attempts to trace the genesis of minichromosomes and  discusses their potential of development into plant artificial chromosome  vectors.

As demonstrated here,  the combined use of Red/ET recombination and unique restriction site elimination  enables extensive manipulation regardless of plasmid size and DNA sequence  elements. First, a selectable marker is PCR-amplified with synthetic primers  attaching 50-bp homology target flanks for Red/ET recombination and an arbitrary  restriction site absent in the substrate plasmid. The resulting cassette is  co-electroporated with substrate plasmids in Red/ET-proficient Escherichia coli  cells. Following isolation of recombinant plasmids, linear nonselectable DNA  replaces the cassette and introduces the desired mutation(s) in a second Red/ET  recombination step. Upon selective digestion of parental plasmids and  retransformation, a 38% mutation efficiency was achieved using a synthetic  97-nucleotide oligonucleotide to cure a 17-bp deletion within lacZalpha of pUC19  (2,686 bp). A PCR fragment was used with similar efficiency to co-replace mouse  Cdkn1b codons 9 and 76 in gene-targeting vector pGTC (13,083 bp).', 'Transposons have been promising elements for gene integration, and the Sleeping  Beauty (SB) system has been the major one for many years, although there have  been several other transposon systems available, for example, Tol2. However,  recently another system known as PiggyBac (PB) has been introduced and developed  for fulfilling the same purposes, for example, mutagenesis, transgenesis and  gene therapy and in some cases with improved transposition efficiency and  advantages over the Sleeping Beauty transposon system, although improved  hyperactive transposase has highly increased the transposition efficacy for SB.  The PB systems have been used in many different scientific research fields;  therefore, the purpose of this review is to describe some of these versatile  uses of the PiggyBac system to give readers an overview on the usage of PiggyBac  system.', 'Engineered DNA-binding proteins that manipulate the human genome and  transcriptome have enabled rapid advances in biomedical research. In particular,  the RNA-guided CRISPR/Cas9 system has recently been engineered to create  site-specific double-strand breaks for genome editing or to direct targeted  transcriptional regulation. A unique capability of the CRISPR/Cas9 system is  multiplex genome engineering by delivering a single Cas9 enzyme and two or more  single guide RNAs (sgRNAs) targeted to distinct genomic sites. This approach can  be used to simultaneously create multiple DNA breaks or to target multiple  transcriptional activators to a single promoter for synergistic enhancement of  gene induction. To address the need for uniform and sustained delivery of  multiplex CRISPR/Cas9-based genome engineering tools, we developed a single  lentiviral system to express a Cas9 variant, a reporter gene and up to four  sgRNAs from independent RNA polymerase III promoters that are incorporated into  the vector by a convenient Golden Gate cloning method. Each sgRNA is efficiently  expressed and can mediate multiplex gene editing and sustained transcriptional  activation in immortalized and primary human cells. This delivery system will be  significant to enabling the potential of CRISPR/Cas9-based multiplex genome  engineering in diverse cell types.']","Genetic engineering, also called genetic modification, is the direct manipulation of an organism's genome using biotechnology. New DNA may be inserted in the host genome by first isolating and copying the genetic material of interest using molecular cloning methods to generate a DNA sequence, or by synthesizing the DNA, and then inserting this construct into the host organism. Genes may be removed, or ""knocked out"", using a nuclease. Gene targeting is a different technique that uses homologous recombination to change an endogenous gene, and can be used to delete a gene, remove exons, add a gene, or introduce point mutations. Based on results there are developed many methods for genetic manipulation of cells such as Microinjection, electroporation, liposomes and via viral vectors."
199,Is creatinine assessment included in the MELD score?,"[""INTRODUCTION: Endovascular therapy represents a less invasive alternative to  open surgery for reconstruction of the portal vein (PV) and the  spleno-mesenteric venous confluence to treat Portal hypertension. The objective  of this study is to determine if the Model for End-Stage Liver Disease (MELD)  score is a useful method to evaluate the risk of morbidity and mortality during  endovascular approaches. MATERIAL AND METHODS: Patients that underwent endovascular reconstruction of the  PV or spleno-mesenteric confluence were identified retrospectively. Data were  collected from November 2011 to August 2016. The MELD score was calculated using  international normalized ratio, serum billirubin and creatinine. Patients were  grouped into moderate (≤ 15) and high (> 15) MELD. Associations of the MELD  score on the postprocedural morbidity, mortality and vessels patency were  assessed by two-sided Fisher's exact test. RESULTS: Seventeen patients were identified; MELD score distribution was: ≤ 15  in 10 patients (59%) and > 15 in 7 (41%). Even distribution of severe PV  thrombosis was treated in both groups, performing predominately jugular access  in the high MELD score group (OR 0.10; 95%; CI 0.014-0.89; p = 0.052) in  contrast to a percutaneous transhepatic access in the moderate MELD score group.  Analysis comparing moderate and high MELD scores was not able to demonstrate  differences in mortality, morbidity or patency rates. CONCLUSION: MELD score did not prove to be a useful method to evaluate risk of  morbidity and mortality; however a high score should not contraindicate  endovascular approaches. In our experience a high technical success, good  patency rates and low complication rates were observed."", 'BACKGROUND & AIM: Patients with end-stage liver disease require valid  estimations of mortality for organ allocation and risk stratification. The model  of end-stage liver disease (MELD) score is used for this purpose in most  countries and incorporates bilirubin, International Normalized ratio, and  creatinine. The aim of this study was to evaluate the comparability of  creatinine results from different routine assays in the serum samples of  patients with liver cirrhosis. METHODS: Residual material from 60 serum samples was available from patients in  different stages of liver cirrhosis. Four centers participated; each center  analyzed the samples with Jaffé-based and enzymatic routine assays in parallel.  In addition, an accredited calibration laboratory certified the panel of samples  by an internationally accepted reference measurement procedure (RMP) based on  isotope dilution mass spectrometry (ID-MS). This method served as the  independent reference. RESULTS: All routine methods displayed a high correlation to the RMP (r ≥0.937,  p<0.001). Two enzymatic and two Jaffé-based methods provided results that were  all within a ±20% range of the RMP. The other methods showed deviations >20% in  up to 27% of the samples. The enzymatic methods were systematically lower,  whereas the Jaffé-based methods were systematically higher (p<0.001). The  resulting MELD scores differed from 0 to 4 points. CONCLUSIONS: There are systematic deviations from the RMP. Jaffé-based assays  gave higher results, whereas the enzymatic-based assays gave lower results  compared to the results of the RMP. The comparability of results is limited and  could be disadvantageous to patients listed for liver transplantation.', 'To compare the performance of eight score systems (MELD, uMELD, MELD-Na. iMELD,  UKELD, MELD-AS, CTP, and mCTP) in predicting the post-transplant mortality, we  analyzed the data of 6,014 adult cirrhotic patients who underwent liver  transplantation between January 2003 and December 2010 from the China Liver  Transplant Registry database. In hepatitis B virus (HBV) group, MELD, uMELD and  MELD-AS showed good predictive accuracies at 3-month mortality after liver  transplantation; by comparison with other five models, MELD presented the best  ability in predicting 3-month, 6-month and 1-year mortality, showing a  significantly better predictive ability than UKELD and iMELD. In hepatitis C  virus and Alcohol groups, the predictive ability did not differ significantly  between MELD and other models. Patient survivals in different MELD categories  were of statistically significant difference. Among patients with MELD score  >35, a new prognostic model based on serum creatinine, need for hemodialysis and  moderate ascites could identify the sickest one. In conclusion, MELD is superior  to other score systems in predicting short-term post-transplant survival in  patients with HBV-related liver disease. Among patients with MELD score >35, a  new prognostic model can identify the sickest patients who should be excluded  from waiting list to prevent wasteful transplantation.', 'Author information: (1)University of Minnesota Medical Center, Minneapolis, MN.

However, its  short-term prognostic superiority over the traditional Child-Turcotte-Pugh (CTP)  score has not been definitely confirmed. The creatinine serum level is an  important predictor of survival in patients with liver cirrhosis. AIMS: To evaluate and compare the short-term prognostic accuracy of the CTP, the  creatinine-modified CTP, and the MELD scores in patients with liver cirrhosis. METHODS: CTP, creatinine-modified CTP, and MELD scores were calculated in a  cohort of 145 cirrhotic patients. The creatinine-modified CTP was calculated as  follows: we assessed the mean creatinine serum level and standard deviation (SD)  of the 145 study patients, then assigned a score of 1 to patients with  creatinine serum levels < or = to the mean, a score of 2 to patients with  creatinine levels between the mean and the mean+1 SD, and a score of 3 to  patients with creatinine levels above the mean+1 SD. The creatinine-modified CTP  was then calculated by simply adding each patients' creatinine score to their  traditional CTP scores. We calculated and compared the accuracy (c-index) of the  three parameters in predicting 3-month survival. RESULTS: The creatinine-modified CTP score showed better prognostic accuracy as  compared with the traditional CTP (P=0.049). However, the MELD score proved to  be better at defining patients' prognosis in the short-term as compared with  both the traditional CTP score (P=0.012) and the creatinine-modified CTP  (P=0.047). The excellent short-term prognostic accuracy of the MELD score was  confirmed even when patients with abnormal creatinine serum levels were excluded  from the analysis (c-index=0.935). CONCLUSIONS: Adding creatinine values to the CTP slightly improves the  prognostic usefulness of the traditional CTP score alone. The MELD score has a  short-term prognostic yield that is better than what is provided by both the CTP  and CTP creatinine-modified scores, even in cirrhotic patients who are not  critically ill. The positive results obtained by using the MELD score were  confirmed even after excluding patients with impaired renal function."", 'BACKGROUND: A number of recent reports have suggested that the cystatin  C/creatinine (CysC/Cr) ratio might be a useful biomarker of renal function in  pediatric patients. In this study we investigated the reference intervals of the  serum CysC/Cr ratio for neonates including very low birth weight infants. CASE-DIAGNOSIS/TREATMENT: A total of 883 blood samples were collected from 246  neonates during the first 30 days of life for the concurrent measurement of  serum CysC and Cr levels. Infants with symptoms or signs of acute kidney injury,  systemic illness, congenital anomaly, or renal pathology were excluded. The  association between serum CysC/Cr ratio and the subgroups of patients was also  analyzed. Reference intervals of serum CysC/Cr ratio were determined according  to the postnatal age and post-conceptional age (PCA). CysC/Cr ratio level  increased according to PCA, except in the first three postnatal days. The serum  CysC/Cr ratio correlated positively with gestational age at birth, birth weight,  postnatal age, and PCA, and negatively with serum CysC and Cr (P < 0.001). CONCLUSIONS: Reference levels of serum CysC/Cr ratio were determined according  to postnatal age and PCA. As the serum CysC/Cr ratio is dependent on several  clinical parameters, these should be considered when assessing the serum CysC/Cr  ratio in neonates.', 'In patients with resistant hypertension (RH) we investigated the importance of  urinary neutrophil gelatinase-associated lipocalin (uNGAL- a chemiluminescent  microparticle immunoassay (CMIA) method became using (Abbott Diagnostics) for  the measurement of NGAL in urine samples) and incidence of chronic kidney  disease using the Modification of Diet in Renal Disease Study (MDRD) and Chronic  Kidney Disease Epidemiology Collaboration (CKD-EPI) equations in estimating  glomerular filtration rate (eGFR) based on standardised serum creatinine method  traceable to isotope dilution mass spectrometry (IDMS) method. It would have  been difficult to predict that levels of these biomarker would perform better  organ damage than traditional measurements of kidney function such as  standardised serum creatinine, MDRD, or CKD-EPI equations in special population  such as RH. Serum creatinine concentrations were measured in 50 patients  (24M:26F from RH Registar in Clinical Hospital Merkur) by the kinetic Jaffe  method. There were no significant differences between the GFR values derived by  MDRD and CKD-EPI equations in the group of patients with RH. 62% of patients  have eGFR > 60 mL/minl/1.73 m2, while a 38% of patients have eGFR < 60  mL/min/1.73 m2. The measurement of NGAL in urine samples of 40 patients with RH  showed no difference and seems to be of no use in further determination of renal  impairement. Higher value of uNGAL in some resistant hypertension patients could  have link in the repair stage after AKI and would reveal pathways that could  link AKI and CKD.', 'BACKGROUND/AIMS: Several formulas for glomerular filtration rate (GFR)  estimation, based on serum creatinine or cystatin C, have been proposed. We  assessed the impact of some of these equations on estimated GFR (eGFR) and  chronic kidney disease (CKD) prevalence, and on the association with  cardiovascular risk factors, in a general population sample characterized by a  young mean age. METHODS: We studied 1,199 individuals from three Alpine villages enrolled into  the MICROS study. eGFR was obtained with the 4- and 6-parameter MDRD study  equations, the Virga equation, and with the three CKD-EPI formulas for  creatinine, cystatin C, and the combination of creatinine and cystatin C. We  assessed the concordance between quantitative eGFR levels, CKD prevalence, and  in terms of association with total, LDL, and HDL cholesterol. RESULTS: The highest and lowest eGFR levels corresponded to the cystatin C-based  and MDRD-4 equations, respectively. CKD prevalence varied from 1.8% (Virga) to  5.8% (MDRD-4). The CKD-EPI based on creatinine showed the highest agreement with  all other equations. Agreement between methods was higher at lower eGFR levels,  older age, and in the presence of diabetes and hypertension. Creatinine-based  estimates of eGFR were associated with total and low-density lipoprotein but not  high-density lipoprotein cholesterol. The opposite was observed for the cystatin  C-based GFR. CONCLUSION: GFR estimation is strongly affected by the chosen equation.  Differences are more pronounced in healthy and younger individuals. To identify  CKD risk factors, the choice of the equation is of secondary importance to the  choice of the biomarker used in the formula. If eGFR is not calibrated to a gold  standard GFR in the general population, reports about CKD prevalence should be  considered with caution.', 'Patients undergoing long-term hemodialysis (HD) are known to have abnormal blood  concentrations of antioxidant minerals; concurrent oxidative stress can  contribute to increased vascular calcification. This study aims to evaluate the  associations between circulating antioxidant minerals and clinical biomarkers of  vascular calcification in HD patients. Blood biochemical parameters, antioxidant  minerals (selenium (Se), zinc (Zn), copper (Cu), and magnesium (Mg)), and  several promoters and inhibitors of calcification (matrix Gla protein (MGP),  fibroblast growth factor-23 (FGF-23), matrix metalloproteinases (MMP-2 and -9),  and tissue inhibitors of metalloproteinase (TIMP-1 and -2)) were determined in  HD patients (n\u2009=\u200962) and age- and sex-matched healthy individuals (n\u2009=\u200930).  Compared with healthy subjects, HD patients had significantly lower plasma  concentrations of Se and Zn, increased Cu and Mg, and higher levels of oxidative  stress and inflammatory markers (Cu/Zn ratios, malondialdehyde (MDA), advanced  glycation end products (AGEs), and C-reactive protein (CRP)). We observed that  HD patients had significantly lower concentrations of MGP and higher levels of  FGF-23, MMP-2 and -9, TIMP-1 and -2, and MMP-2/TIMP-2 and MMP-9/TIMP-1 ratios.  We also observed significant relationships between the concentrations of these  minerals and calcification biomarkers in HD patients. These results suggest that  changes in the homeostasis of antioxidant minerals (Se, Zn, Cu, and Mg) may  contribute to the effects of oxidative stress and inflammatory status, thereby  participating in the mechanism for accelerated vascular calcification in  patients undergoing long-term HD.', 'BACKGROUND: The timely diagnosis of acute kidney injury (AKI) in liver cirrhosis  is challenging. AIM: To evaluate whether quantification of glomerular filtration rate (GFR),  proteinuria and kidney injury biomarkers can accurately predict the development  of AKI. METHODS: A prospective cohort analysis of patients with cirrhosis was performed.  Measures of baseline kidney function included serum creatinine, iohexol  clearance and urine protein:creatinine ratio. Blood and urine samples were  collected daily. A retrospective analysis of cystatin C GFR and neutrophil  gelatinase-associated lipocalin (NGAL) measured 48 h prior to the diagnosis of  AKI was undertaken to evaluate their ability to predict the development of AKI. RESULTS: Eighteen of the 34 cirrhosis patients studied developed AKI. A GFR <60  mL/min/1.73 m(2) was identified in 56% with Iohexol clearance compared to 8%  using the four-variable modified diet in renal disease formula (P < 0.0001).  Prediction of AKI, 48 h prior to the development of AKI with cystatin C GFR and  serum NGAL concentration were similar; area under the receiver operating curve  (AUROC) values 0.74 (0.51-0.97), P = 0.04 and 0.72 (0.52-0.92), P = 0.02  respectively. The development of AKI was strongly predicted by urine  protein:creatinine ratio above the cut-off of >30 (equivalent to 300 mg/day of  proteinuria) sensitivity 82% (57-96) and specificity 80% (52-96), AUROC 0.86  (0.73-0.98), P ≤ 0.0001. [OR 21 (3-133), P ≤ 0.002]. CONCLUSIONS: In patients with liver cirrhosis a urine protein:creatinine ratio  >30 predicts AKI. Iohexol clearance and cystatin C formulae identify a greater  proportion of patients with a GFR <60 mL/min/1.73 m(2), which also predicts the  development of AKI.']","Yes, creatinine is included in the Model For End-Stage Liver Disease (MELD) score. Other components of the MELD score are international normalized ratio and serum billirubin. The MELD score is used for evaluation of liver cirrhosis."
