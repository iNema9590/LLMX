Representative John J. Esch (R-Wisconsin) was the sponsor.  Prior to this time and despite federal control of navigable waters and the necessary congressional approval to construct such facilities, Congress had left the regulation of hydroelectric power to the individual states.

He was completely unaware and continually spoke about his girlfriend to Swift, something she pretended to be endeared by.  Years afterwards, Hardwick appeared at Swift\'s house, but Swift rejected him.  Musically, the track is soft and is primarily guided by a gentle acoustic guitar.

In retrospect, Swift has stated that she has evolved on a personal level and as a songwriter, claiming she processed emotions differently since ""Picture to Burn"".  The song was chosen as a single based on the audience\'s reaction to it in concert.  Musically, the track is of the country rock genre with prominent usage of guitar, banjo, and drums.

Historically, ""ziemianie"" consisted of hereditary nobles (""szlachta"") and landed commoners.  The Statutes of Piotrków (1496) restricted the right to hold manorial lordships to hereditary nobility.  The non-nobles thus had to either sell their estates to the lords or seek a formal ennoblement for themselves (not an easy task), or had their property taken away.  A rare exception was the burgesses of certain specially privileged ""ennobled"" royal cities who were titled ""nobilis"" and were allowed to buy and inherit manorial estates and exercise their privileges (such as jurisdiction over their subjects) and monopolies (over distilleries, hunting grounds, etc.).  Therefore, in the ""szlachta""-dominated Polish–Lithuanian Commonwealth there was almost no landed-gentry in the English meaning of the term, i.e. commoners who owned landed estates.

"Niki Juusela has commentary for what family of team sports that involve, to varying degrees, kicking a ball with the foot to score a goal","['N', 'N', 'N', 'N', 'N', 'P', 'N', 'N', 'P', 'N']","['A kickoff is a method of starting a drive in American football and Canadian football.  Typically, a kickoff consists of one team – the ""kicking team"" – kicking the ball to the opposing team – the ""receiving team"".  The receiving team is then entitled to ""return"" the ball, i.e., attempt to advance it towards the kicking team\'s end zone, until the player with the ball is tackled by the kicking team, goes out of bounds, or scores a touchdown.  Kickoffs take place at the start of each half of play, the beginning of overtime in some overtime formats, and after some scoring plays.\n', 'Roll ball or rollball is a sport similar to basketball or handball that is played on inline roller skates.  The play consists of two teams of six players each, five field players and a goal tender.  Players move toward the goal while dribbling or passing a ball similar to a basketball, with the aim of throwing the ball into a goal at each end of the court.  The team that is able to score more goals wins.  There are two referees in a match.  The ball can be held in either one or both the hands, even during passing and shooting.  Player interaction is similar to basketball in that a player must dribble the ball while carrying it.  A player may dribble, pass or throw the ball with single or both the hands.  It is a violation to run or roll with the ball without dribbling or to deliberately kick or block the ball it with any part of the leg.  To accidentally come into contact or touch the ball with the foot or leg is not a violation.  Players may also not strike the ball with a fist.  Foul rules are similar to those of association football, including the use of yellow cards and red cards.\n', 'In the sport of Australian rules football, a kick-in (sometimes known as a kick-out) occurs when an opposition team scores a behind, with a defender kicking the ball out from the defensive goalsquare.  The team kicking in may elect any one of its players to take the kick-in.  The man on the mark stands five metres in front of the goal square.  The player kicking in is given approximately ten to fifteen seconds from when they pick up the ball to take their kick before the umpire will call play-on, at which point the man on the mark may advance.  Players kicking in may either kick to a teammate, or kick to themselves to allow themselves to play on.  Whichever option is taken, the player must kick from wholly within the white lines of the goal square, even if the umpire has already called play-on for taking too much time - if their foot touches the line of the goal square, then play is stopped and the umpire will bounce the ball at the centre of the kick-off line.\n', 'A Virtual Military Organization (VMO) is a dedicated hobby organization that uses simulation to model the operations of a military.  Virtual Military Organizations (VMOs) generally have a presence on the internet, similar to real military organizations.  Most VMOs simulate military operations to varying degrees.  A newer variant of Virtual Military is the MilSim unit.  MilSim units differ from Virtual Military by placing emphasis on the simulation of military tactics in their chosen gaming platform, whereas traditionally, VMOs have placed emphasis on simulating the bigger picture, including a full military career path, logistics systems, coordinated movement of equipment around the world, and prolonged military operations.  Although VMOs may appear to be a type of gaming clan, a key difference is that a gaming clan\'s primary purpose is to be an ""organized group of players that regularly play together.""  VMOs are essentially role-playing environments within which an individual can immerse themselves.  ""Realism"" groups are semantically similar; however, their primary focus is usually on following real-life procedures as much as possible.  Therefore, tactical realism and MilSim are almost synonymous in the gaming world.

There are three subtypes which affect multiple organs to varying degrees, but the fundamental abnormalities involve the cerebellum which controls muscle coordination.  The adjacent fourth ventricle is often affected, which can alter the flow of cerebrospinal fluid, increase intracranial pressure, and lead to multiple other brain function problems.  The degree of disability varies but is typically lifelong.  Treatment may involve physical therapy, special education, or surgical placement of a cerebral shunt.  It is named for Walter Dandy and Arthur Earl Walker.  In the majority of individuals with Dandy–Walker malformation, signs and symptoms caused by abnormal brain development are present at birth or develop within the first year of life.  Some children have a buildup of fluid in the brain (hydrocephalus) that may cause increased head size (macrocephaly).  Up to half of affected individuals have intellectual disability that ranges from mild to severe, and those with normal intelligence may have learning disabilities.  Children with Dandy–Walker malformation often have delayed development, particularly a delay in motor skills such as crawling, walking, and coordinating movements.

She was raised in a traditional religious family with 5 sisters and 2 brothers.  She grew up in a traditional neighbourhood in Bogotá in a warm, safe family atmosphere, maintaining a special relationship with her loving and caring mother.  Upon graduating from high school, in the years 1951-52 she got a degree in Architectural Design at the Colegio Mayor de Cundinamarca in Bogotá.  After graduation, the future textile artist worked for a year as a director of the Architectural Drawing Faculty at the same school.  In 1954, de Amaral went to the United States to study English in New York at the Columbia University.  She then moved and studied fiber art at the Cranbrook Academy of Art in Bloomfield Hills, Michigan, USA (1954–55).  The artist cherishes that period of her education and considers it crucial for her later artistic development: ""In Cranbrook, the textile workshop had eight looms placed against the windows: one of them, in the corner, would be my home for a year.  There, I lived my most intimate moments of solitude; there was born my certainty about color; its strength; I felt as if I loved color as though it were something tangible.  I also learned to speak in color.  I remember with nostalgia that experience in which souls touched hands"".  At Cranbrook de Amaral met Jim Amaral and they became close friends.  In 1955, after a year in Cranbrook, she returned to Colombia and started to make decorative textiles on commission for her architect friends.  Meanwhile, Jim Amaral was in the U.S. Navy, on a base in the Philippines.  In 1956, Jim visited Colombia to see Olga, initially for a few weeks.  Shortly after, Jim Amaral and Olga Ceballos Velez married and settled in Bogotá.  They started a family (children Diego and Andrea) and a workshop of handwoven textiles.  During that period, Jack Lenor Larsen visited Colombia and the Amaral\'s workshop.  He expressed interest in Olga\'s tapestries.  Their professional and artistic relationship became crucial in projection of her work internationally in the world of contemporary tapestry.  In 1965 de Amaral founded and taught at the Textile Department at the Universidad de los Andes (University of the Andes) in Bogotá.  In 1966-1967 the Amaral family lived in New York.  There Olga de Amaral met Eileen Vanderbilt from the World Crafts Council and became its representative for Colombia.  With Jack Lenor Larsen\'s collaboration, Olga de Amaral displayed her tapestries in New York (solo exhibition in Jack Lenor Larsen’s New York showroom in 1967), taught at Penland School of Crafts in North Carolina and in Haystack Mountain School of Crafts in Maine.  After returning to Colombia, the Amarals travelled to Popayán and Tierradentro region with its must-see San Agustín.  Later Olga visited Peru as the WCC representative.  On a rapid visit to Ireland to participate in a WCC conference, Olga met Lucie Rie, a British ceramist who inspired her to incorporate gold into the tapestries.  At the beginning of the seventies, the Amarals moved to Barcelona and then to Paris.  They visited Greece, Italy, Holland, Belgium, Switzerland, Sweden, and England.  They made contacts with the centres of European art.  They lived for a time in Europe, then returned to Bogotá, visited different areas of Colombia, and then went back to France, amid exhibits, work, and new friendships.

Grand Anglo-Français Tricolore and and Kai Ken are breeds of what animal?,"['N', 'N', 'N', 'N', 'N', 'N', 'N', 'P', 'N', 'P']","['Cryoconservation of animal genetic resources is a strategy wherein samples of animal genetic materials are preserved cryogenically.  Animal genetic resources, as defined by the Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations, are ""those animal species that are used, or may be used, for the production of food and agriculture, and the populations within each of them.  These populations within each species can be classified as wild and feral populations, landraces and primary populations, standardised breeds, selected lines, varieties, strains and any conserved genetic material; all of which are currently categorized as Breeds.""  Genetic materials that are typically cryogenically preserved include sperm, oocytes, embryos and somatic cells.  Cryogenic facilities are called gene banks and can vary greatly in size usually according to the economic resources available.  They must be able to facilitate germplasm collection, processing, freezing, and long term storage, all in a hygienic and organized manner.  Gene banks must maintain a precise database and make information and genetic resources accessible to properly facilitate cryoconservation.  Cryoconservation is an ""ex situ"" conservation strategy that often coexists alongside ""in situ"" conservation to protect and preserve livestock genetics.  Cryoconservation of livestock genetic resources is primarily done in order to preserve the genetics of populations of interest, such as indigenous breeds, also known as local or minor breeds.  Material may be stored because individuals shared specific genes and phenotypes that may be of value or have potential value for researchers or breeders.  Therefore, one of the main goals remains preserving the gene pool of local breeds that may be threatened.  Indigenous livestock genetics are commonly threatened by factors such as globalization, modernization, changes in production systems, inappropriate introduction of major breeds, genetic drift, inbreeding, crossbreeding, climate change, natural disasters, disease, cultural changes, and urbanization.  Indigenous livestock are critical to sustainable agricultural development and food security, due to their: adaptation to environment and endemic diseases, indispensable part in local production systems, social and cultural significance, and importance to local rural economies.  The genetic resources of minor breeds have value to the local farmers, consumers of the products, private companies and investors interested in crossbreeding, breed associations, governments, those conducting research and development, and non-governmental organizations.  Therefore, efforts have been made by national governments and non-governmental organizations, such as the Livestock Conservancy, to encourage conservation of livestock genetics through cryoconservation, as well as through other ""ex situ"" and ""in situ"" strategies.  Cryogenic specimens of livestock genetic resources can be preserved and used for extended periods of time.  This advantage makes cryoconservation beneficial particularly for threatened breeds who have low breed populations.  Cryogenically preserved specimens can be used to revive breeds that are endangered or extinct, for breed improvement, crossbreeding, research and development.  However, cryoconservation can be an expensive strategy and requires long term hygienic and economic commitment for germplasms to remain viable.  Cryoconservation can also face unique challenges based on the species, as some species have a reduced survival rate of frozen germplasm.\n', 'The Nihon Ken Hozonkai (日本犬保存会 , The Association for the Preservation of the Japanese Dog ) , commonly abbreviated to Nippo, is a preserver and maintainer of the registries for the six native Japanese dog breeds: the Akita Inu, Hokkaido, Kai Ken, Kishu, Shikoku, and Shiba Inu.

From a winemaking perspective, each step in the process plays a vital role in the development of grapes with ideal characteristics for making wine.  Viticulturalists and vineyard managers monitor the effect of climate, vine disease and pests in facilitating or impeding the vines progression from bud break, flowering, fruit set, veraison, harvesting, leaf fall and dormancy-reacting if need be with the use of viticultural practices like canopy management, irrigation, vine training and the use of agrochemicals.  The stages of the annual growth cycle usually become observable within the first year of a vine's life.

Although well adapted to a wide range of growing conditions, Chanpanel produces fruit with aroma characteristic of its Concord perantage and is not often seen commercially.

"What founder of a trademarked brand name for a patented process used to create audio patterns containing binaural beats,became known for his research into altered consciousness and founding  of what?","['N', 'P', 'N', 'N', 'N', 'P', 'N', 'N', 'N', 'N']","[""Ansco was the brand name of a photographic company based in Binghamton, New York, which produced photographic films, papers and cameras from the mid-1800s until the 1980s.  In the Late 1880s ANSCO's predecessor, Anthony and Scovill, bought the Goodwin Camera & Film Company.  Hannibal Goodwin invented the flexible photographic film, which should have made Anthony Scovill the leader in the amateur photography business.  But George Eastman copied the patented process and immediately set out to compete against Anthony Scovill.  The ruthless behavior of Eastman nearly drove the now named ANSCO out of business, but a settlement in 1905 saved the company from bankruptcy.  Eastman Kodak got away cheaply on this legal proceeding.  In 1928 AGFA merged with ANSCO to allow it to compete in the worldwide photographic market like its competitors, Kodak and Zeiss.  This joint company added many AGFA cameras and accessories to its sales in the USA as a result of this.  In the months after the bombing of Pearl Harbor, the US Government seized AGFA-ANSCO.  This now government-run business continued to survive as a hostile alien property (under government control into the 1960s).  During this period, the organization was renamed GAF (General Aniline & Film Corporation).  Throughout the postwar period the concern sold rebadged versions of cameras made by other manufacturers, including Agfa and Chinon.  A Minolta-built Ansco model was the first 35 mm camera in space and their film was used in space, too.\n"", 'Hemi-Sync is a trademarked brand name for a patented process used to create audio patterns containing binaural beats, which are commercialized in the form of audio CDs.

At its simplest level, an isochronic tone is a tone that is being turned on and off rapidly.  They create sharp, distinctive pulses of sound.\n', 'I-Doser is an application for the playback of proprietary audio content.  The developer claims the separately purchasable content aims to simulate specific mental states through the use of binaural beats, and some of it is named after prohibited recreational drugs.

The explosive comprises a combination of ammonium nitrate and/or ammonium perchlorate (oxidizers), and a fuel - primarily aluminum powder - that is supplied as two separate powders that are mixed by the user.  The combination is relatively stable when subjected to forces less severe than a high-velocity bullet impact, such as a hammer blow, being dropped, or impact from a low-velocity bullet or shotgun blast.  It is also not flammable – an explosion cannot be created by a burning fuse or electricity.  Because it is sold as two separate powders, it can be transported and sold in many places without the legal restrictions that would otherwise apply to explosives.  The target system as a whole is the patented, trademarked product called Tannerite, although the term is often used to refer to the explosive mixture itself, and other combination explosives are often generically referred to as Tannerite.\n', 'Sleep in non-human animals refers to a behavioral and physiological state characterized by altered consciousness, reduced responsiveness to external stimuli, and homeostatic regulation.  Sleep is observed in mammals, birds, reptiles, amphibians, and some fish, and, in some form, in insects and even in simpler animals such as nematodes.  The internal circadian clock promotes sleep daily at night in diurnal organisms (such as humans) and in the day in nocturnal organisms (such as rodents).  However, sleep patterns vary widely among species.  Sleep appears to be a requirement for all mammals and most other animals.\n', 'Marcelo von Schwartz (born Marcelo Schvartz, August 16, 1961) is an Argentine film director, architect, photographer and sound architect.
