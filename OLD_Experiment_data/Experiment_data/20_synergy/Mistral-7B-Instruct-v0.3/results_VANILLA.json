However, it's important to note that the general climate of Zhykara is a harsh land of red deserts and towering canyons, which contrasts with the snow storm. This suggests that Ktharr City, being carved into the cliffs of the Dragon's Maw canyon, may have a climate that is colder than the rest of Zhykara, making it susceptible to snow storms.","top_k":null,"doc_id":[[["A","B","C","D","E","F","G","H","I","J"]]],"FM_matrix":[[[1497.727674839,4.566618471,18.3058567422,-10.5244664288,-4.4044310669,-8.6767684935,0.5827330459,-0.4213982117,3.7421714841,1.4402010557],[4.566618471,42.8207551848,2.9075219806,-1.6067220227,6.8273298148,-15.8347186729,5.5582688888,5.0204816511,7.1594758841,17.12473154],[18.3058567422,2.9075219806,5.6083330695,0.844307874,-3.4228201708,-2.3833964009,1.2242517644,-5.2953999384,-1.3263368525,3.2391465922],[-10.5244664288,-1.6067220227,0.844307874,0.3813153627,-0.9838374611,0.3539283818,-0.0004820384,-1.3390873712,-0.6639927207,-0.264805503],[-4.4044310669,6.8273298148,-3.4228201708,-0.9838374611,3.9581350409,-1.6400967204,0.3007186501,4.9567141076,2.5024575608,1.1325310473],[-8.6767684935,-15.8347186729,-2.3833964009,0.3539283818,-1.6400967204,6.2228776166,-2.2981458981,-0.5395340968,-2.2375257661,-6.7452928306],[0.5827330459,5.5582688888,1.2242517644,-0.0004820384,0.3007186501,-2.2981458981,0.89994049,-0.253197973,0.6388845262,2.4912040739],[-0.4213982117,5.0204816511,-5.2953999384,-1.3390873712,4.9567141076,-0.5395340968,-0.253197973,6.6835233528,2.8421383702,-0.2668222833],[3.7421714841,7.1594758841,-1.3263368525,-0.6639927207,2.5024575608,-2.2375257661,0.6388845262,2.8421383702,1.8635476096,2.1027677377],[1.4402010557,17.12473154,3.2391465922,-0.264805503,1.1325310473,-6.7452928306,2.4912040739,-0.2668222833,2.1027677377,7.8069449633]]],"scoring":[{"Exact":[24.3129632692,61.4423464805,53.1579092011,50.0558575358,2.3985760008,11.4482523661,-2.8727417022,-0.3767689871,5.6333984647,3.4379408307],"ContextCite32":[18.5703115026,60.5419596086,45.4549844065,45.7558502287,9.2254807999,8.7908034887,-8.0896721085,4.2523468816,7.1654075815,-10.8099054595],"KernelShap32":[19.0159519357,79.4577783066,43.3658559713,47.1087905241,-4.3704551357,8.818099787,-2.0970452311,1.8980155461,-2.0199792176,1.2714165791],"WSS32":[23.8033428023,55.3443659301,44.6807969235,47.3673637034,23.9048029274,12.1450062401,-7.6646086149,8.8975557787,6.1002294708,-11.1695925767],"BetaShap

of a localized zone that disrupts kinetic energy transfer and dampens electromagnetic fields.","Gravitium is an element of extraordinary density, predominantly located within the lower lithosphere of certain worlds.","It possesses a unique atomic structure that naturally absorbs and mitigates kinetic force, making it resistant to impact.","Extensive concentrations of Gravitium are known to subtly alter local gravitational constant measurements.","Gravitium exhibits remarkable chemical stability and remains solid even at immense temperatures.","Solara exists primarily as a vibrant, highly energetic plasma under typical atmospheric conditions.","Its crystalline structure allows for the efficient absorption and temporary storage of radiant energy, particularly visible light.","Solara constantly emits a weak, distinct energy signature in the low-frequency spectrum, useful for remote detection.","The inherent reactivity and energetic state of Solara necessitate specialized magnetic
